Advancements in multi-omics technology present both challenges and opportunities for AD diagnosis, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions among contributing factors, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel feature fusion approach in this study, AD-GCN, which integrates multi-omics data and their interaction networks to achieve more precise diagnosis and analysis of AD. In this study, we applied polygenic risk score and random forest algorithms for feature selection on genetic variation and methylation data. We then developed an AD-GCN for both multi-omics and single-omics classification tasks and compared its performance with that of machine learning ensemble methods. The experimental results demonstrated that multi-omics classification significantly outperformed single-omics classification, with AD-GCN surpassing the machine-learning ensembles. These findings highlight AD-GCN's strong potential to enhance AD diagnosis and improve accuracy in differentiating disease stages by integrating interactions across omics data, laying a solid foundation for the development of more precise and personalized AD diagnostic models.</p>

However, with the growth of complex lab experiments, large datasets, many analytical tools, and expansive literature, biomedical research is increasingly constrained by repetitive and fragmented workflows that slow discovery and limit innovation, underscoring the need for a fundamentally new way to scale scientific expertise. Here, we introduce Biomni, a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide spectrum of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. To systematically map the biomedical action space, Biomni first employs an action discovery agent to create the first unified agentic environment -- mining essential tools, databases, and protocols from tens of thousands of publications across 25 biomedical domains. Built on this foundation, Biomni features a generalist agentic architecture that integrates large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, enabling it to dynamically compose and carry out complex biomedical workflows -- entirely without relying on predefined templates or rigid task flows. Systematic benchmarking demonstrates that Biomni achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous biomedical tasks -- including causal gene prioritization, drug repurposing, rare disease diagnosis, microbiome analysis, and molecular cloning -- without any task-specific prompt tuning. Real-world case studies further showcase Biomni's ability to interpret complex, multi-modal biomedical datasets and autonomously generate experimentally testable protocols. Biomni envisions a future where virtual AI biologists operate alongside and augment human scientists to dramatically enhance research productivity, clinical insight, and healthcare. Biomni is ready to use at https://biomni.stanford.edu, and we invite scientists to explore its capabilities, stress-test its limits, and co-create the next era of biomedical discoveries.</p>

Accurate and scalable ortholog detection is central to this goal, particularly in cross-species single-cell analysis. However, conventional methods are time-consuming and perform poorly with distantly related species, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce PLM-OMG, a protein language model-based framework for orthogroup classification and cross-species cell type mapping. We benchmark five deep learning models including ESM2, ProGen2, ProteinBERT, ProtGPT2, and LSTM, using a curated 15-species dataset and large-scale monocot and dicot datasets from PLAZA. Transformer-based models, particularly ProtGPT2 and ESM2, achieve superior accuracy and generalization across evolutionary distances. Our results show that PLM-OMG enables scalable and reusable orthogroup detection without recomputing existing groups, significantly reducing computational overhead and highlighting its potential to transform cross-species transcriptomic analysis in plant genomics.</p>

Here we created a gene set foundation model that was trained on a massive collection of unlabeled gene sets from two databases: Rummagene and RummaGEO. Rummagene automatically extracts gene sets from supplemental tables of publications; and RummaGEO has gene sets automatically computed from comparing groups of samples from RNA-seq studies deposited into the gene expression omnibus. Several foundation model architectures and data sources for training were benchmarked in the task of predicting gene function. Such predictions were also compared to other state-of-the-art gene function prediction methods and models. One of the GSFM architectures achieves superior performance compared to all other methods and models. This model was used to systematically predict gene functions for all human gene. These predictions are served on gene pages that are accessible from https://gsfm.maayanlab.cloud.</p>

Traditional penalized regression methods like lasso and ridge regression apply uniform shrinkage without considering underlying biological relationships between genes, often resulting in unstable feature selection and reduced interpretability. Network-regularized methods that incorporate prior biological knowledge have emerged as promising alternatives, yet systematic comparisons of different network penalties in accelerated failure time (AFT) models remain limited. Methods: We developed and evaluated Weibull AFT models incorporating two network-regularized approaches: inverse-degree penalties that apply stronger shrinkage to highly connected hub genes, and graph Laplacian penalties that promote smoothness across connected nodes. We conducted comprehensive simulations across varying signal strengths, censoring rates (30%, 50%, 80%), and noise levels, followed by real-data applications on three cancer datasets (TCGA-KIRC, TCGA-COAD, and IDH-wildtype gliomas) using both STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and co-expression networks. Performance was assessed using estimation and prediction mean squared error, false positive/negative rates, concordance index, and pathway enrichment analysis. Results: The inverse-degree penalty demonstrated consistently more conservative feature selection behavior, achieving substantially lower false positive rates while maintaining competitive predictive performance compared to Laplacian penalties. In simulation studies, the inverse-degree method achieved false positive rates of 0.126 versus 0.299 for Laplacian penalties under strong signal conditions. Real-data applications showed comparable predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.61-0.73) between methods across cancer types. Both methods successfully identified biologically relevant pathways including mTORC1 regulation and fatty acid metabolism in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and IL-17/chemokine signaling in IDH-wildtype gliomas. Notably, in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) analysis, the inverse-degree method identified ten coherent pathways centered on inflammation, cell-cycle regulation, and proteasome function, while the Laplacian approach introduced potentially spurious neurotransmitter-release associations, demonstrating the inverse-degree penalty's superior biological interpretability. Conclusions: Network-regularized AFT models with inverse-degree penalties offer a valuable tool for biomarker discovery in high-dimensional genomic survival analysis, providing conservative feature selection and superior biological interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive performance. The accompanying DegreeAFT R package makes these methods accessible to the broader research community, facilitating adoption in precision oncology applications where identifying reliable prognostic signatures is critical for treatment decision-making.</p>

The popularity of droplet-based single-cell protocols has spurred the develop- ment of computational tools that expect the read structure of the assay to include a cell barcode (CB). Microwell plate-based protocols, such as the Switching Mechanism At the 5' end of the RNA Transcript (SMART) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) family of methods, typically do not add a CB as part of the library preparation method as there is typically one cell per well and standard unique dual indices are sufficient for multiplexing. While several tools exist to manipulate and parse varying single-cell read structures, no tool is currently available to easily add synthetic CBs to enable use of computational tooling that expects the presence of a CB, such as STARsolo, zUMIs, and Alevin. Synthbar fills this gap as a lightweight tool that is assay agnostic, can add user-defined CBs, and modify read structures.

We introduce aseQC, a statistical framework that quantifies sample-level ASE quality in terms of the overall expected extra-binomial variation to exclude uncharacteristically noisy samples in a cohort to improve robustness of downstream analyses. Applying aseQC to a dataset of rare mendelian muscular disorders, successfully identified previously annotated low-quality cases demonstrating clinical genomic utility. When applied to 15,253 samples in extensively quality controlled GTEx project data, aseQC uncovered 563 low-quality samples that exhibit excessive allelic imbalance. We identify these to be associated with specific processing dates but not otherwise described adequately by any other quality control measures and metadata available in GTEx data. We show that these low-quality samples lead to 23.6 and 31.6 -fold increased ASE, and splicing outliers, degrading the performance of transcriptome analysis for rare variant interpretation. In contrast, we did not observe any adverse effect associated with inclusion of these samples in common-variant analysis using quantitative traits loci mapping. By enabling quick and reliable assessment of sample quality, aseQC presents a critical step for identifying subtle quality issues that remain critical for a successful analysis of rare variant effects using transcriptome data.</p>

Current sequence-to-label methods typically employ the two-stage pipeline: (i) encoding mutant sequences using neural networks (e.g., transformers), followed by (ii) the {Delta}{Delta}G regression from the latent representations. Although these methods have demonstrated promising performance, their dependence on specialized neural network encoders significantly increases the complexity. Additionally, the requirement to individually compute latent representations for each mutant site negatively impacts computational efficiency and poses the risk of overfitting. This work proposes the Venus-MAXWELL framework, which reformulates mutation {Delta}{Delta}G prediction as a sequence-to-landscape task. In Venus-MAXWELL, mutations of a protein and their corresponding {Delta}{Delta}G values are organized into a landscape matrix, allowing our framework to learn the {Delta}{Delta}G landscape of a protein with a single forward and backward pass during training. Besides, to facilitate future works, we also curated a large-scale {Delta}{Delta}G dataset with strict controls on data leakage and redundancy to ensure robust evaluation. Venus-MAXWELL is compatible with multiple protein language models and enables these models for accurate and efficient {Delta}{Delta}G prediction. For example, when integrated with the ESM-IF, Venus-MAXWELL achieves higher accuracy than ThermoMPNN with 10x faster in inference speed (despite having 50x more parameters than ThermoMPNN). The training codes, model weights, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/Venus-MAXWELL.</p>

Unraveling these underlying biomolecular interactions is a key challenge that hinders a profound understanding of disease mechanisms. Although current models can accurately predict quantitative binding affinity, their application in pathogenic research is limited by difficulties in defining trend types, particularly extreme "disrupting" cases, along with poor generalizability beyond single-point mutations (SNP) and insufficient biological interpretability. Here, we present TAPPI, an interpretable large language model-driven deep learning framework, to perform Trends Assessment of Protein-Protein Interaction. It categorizes PPI variations' trends into four types: disrupting, decreasing, no effect, and increasing, enabling fine-grained functional assessments and bridging genetic mutation and disease mechanisms. The framework generalizes effectively across both single-point and multi-point mutations and captures complex trend outcomes relevant to diverse disease landscapes. In benchmark evaluations, TAPPI achieved the state-of-the-art prediction performance and demonstrated biological relevance through interpretable results. In external datasets from Autism Spectrum Disorder, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Epileptic Encephalopathies, given the premise that TAPPI's predicted results align with pathogenic patterns, these results reveal how genetic mutations indirectly perturb disease-associated pathways and supporting our perspective of "crucial disrupting" and "bridging mutations-disease". In summary, accurate, interpretable, and pathogenically relevant prediction of PPI variations trend predicted by TAPPI provides a novel approach for mechanistic discovery.</p>

This study introduces PyamilySeq, a flexible and transparent framework designed to systematically identify challenges in gene clustering and pangenomic analysis, and to support the development of practical solutions. By evaluating widely used gene clustering and pangenome tools, we can observe how clustering thresholds (often hard-coded or provided without a clear reason) and paralog handling impact gene family composition. More strikingly, while such tools are operated under the assumption that running them with broadly the same parameters will yield consistent results, this study demonstrates how parameters unrelated to clustering thresholds, such as parameter decimal precision (0.8 vs. 0.80), output selection, and even CPU and memory allocation, can alter gene family assignments. Additionally, sequence clustering and pangenome tools often fail to report biologically meaningful or representative sequences for gene families, further complicating downstream analyses. This work highlights key limitations in current gene clustering and pangenome methodologies, demonstrating their potential to influence biological interpretations in fundamental ways. To advance the field, we must prioritise adaptable and transparent approaches that refine gene clustering methodologies and move beyond rigid, one-size-fits-all tools and parameter choices.</p>

Spectral library search and library-free search are the two major approaches for DIA data analysis. The spectral library search requires high-quality spectral libraries derived from the search results of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments, while library-free approaches rely on prediction models to generate in silico libraries. Both methodologies constrain the search space to the peptide list in the database, limiting the discovery of variant peptides arising from genetic variations or mutations. We present a novel computational method DIAVariant designed to identify peptide sequence variants directly and solely from complex DIA spectra while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIAVariant successfully identifies sequence variants previously detected through proteogenomic approaches, while maintaining high specificity across multiple datasets. When integrated with existing DIA database search solutions, our approach constitutes a comprehensive analytical workflow capable of identifying peptides both represented within reference protein databases and those arising from sequence variations not captured in standard databases.</p>

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) already supplies nitrogen to legume crops and several avenues of research are underway to extend it to non-legume crops. In maize (Zea mays), aerial roots have been shown to contribute to BNF in some varieties, and both having many aerial roots and large aerial roots contributes to the fixation trait. However, much of the genetics controlling aerial root number and size is still unknown. Here we validate and quantify BNF in maize varieties from Southern Mexico under controlled conditions and evaluate a population of double haploids derived from the elite inbred PHZ51 crossed with these varieties. We find that most aerial root traits (root number, nodes with roots, root size) are reasonably heritable (h2 0.5-0.75) and generally uncorrelated with each other. QTL mapping identifies 5 QTL each affecting nodes with aerial roots and aerial root number per node; in both cases all but 1 QTL show an increase from the landrace allele. We also identify 11 QTL for aerial root diameter, with most positive QTL coming from PHZ51. Between the two populations, only a few QTL overlap, indicating a presumably high diversity of genes affecting aerial root morphology in landrace populations. Combining the best QTL into elite material may provide a path toward meaningful levels of BNF for maize, and additional work is needed to determine how viable this approach will be in field settings.</p>
