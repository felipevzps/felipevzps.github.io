Detecting NSCLC at the early stage can decrease the mortality rate and minimise harm caused by various treatments. We curated 2050 samples from public tissue and plasma datasets including both invasive and noninvasive types, then supplemented with in-house pooled plasma and exosome samples. Eleven independent transcriptome datasets were utilised to develop a new machine learning model by integrating PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) to predict NSCLC. Five piRNA signatures derived from ribosomal subunits identified to be tumour-specific exhibited robust diagnostic ability and were combined into a piRNA-Based Tumour Probability Index (pi-TPI) risk evaluation model. pi-TPI effectively distinguished NSCLC patients from healthy individuals and showed efficacy in identifying early-stage cancers with Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values over .80. Plasma cohorts exhibited the diagnosis efficacy of pi-TPI with an AUC value of .85. Experimental exosomal data enhances the accuracy of diagnosing noncancerous, benign, and cancer cases. The pi-TPI marker in the noncancer/cancer subgroup exhibited superior predictive performance with an AUC value of .96. These findings underscore the significant clinical potential of the five piRNA signatures as a powerful diagnostic tool for NSCLC, particularly of noninvasive cancer diagnostics.</p>

However, developing new antimicrobial compounds faces many challenges, improvements in cultivation methods, genetic engineering, and advanced technologies are opening new paths for discovering and producing effective antibiotics. This study focuses on the fungal microbiome as a promising source of new antibiotics. We explored historical developments and advanced genetic techniques to reveal the potential of fungi in antibiotic production. Although isolating and scaling up fungal antibiotic production presents challenges, innovative approaches like in situ separation during fermentation can effectively address these issues. Our research highlights the importance of understanding fungal communication and metabolite sharing to enhance antibiotic yields and the connection of cutting-edge technologies in accelerating the discovery and optimization of antibiotic-producing fungi. By focusing on these technical aspects and fostering teamwork across various fields, this study aims to overcome current obstacles, and advance the development of antibiotic production technologies.</p>

Although the treatment choice for infections caused by these pathogens is often similar, precise species characterization enhances our epidemiological understanding. While whole-genome sequencing can accurately distinguish Klebsiella species accurately, those analyses are time-consuming, requiring specialized expertise, and are not currently used in routine clinical laboratories. Therefore, developing a timely and accurate pathogen characterization method is essential for effective treatment, management, and infection control measures. This study combined MALDI-TOF MS in negative ion mode with machine learning techniques to identify potential lipid biomarkers as a novel method to distinguish between K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae. Using this method, we identified discriminative features between the species, with peaks at m/z 2157, m/z 1931, m/z 1964, m/z 2042, and m/z 1407 highlighted as potential biomarkers for species identification. Our findings suggest that the lipid profiles of the species obtained from MALDI-TOF MS can serve as effective biomarkers for distinguishing Klebsiella species. Further research should focus on the structural identification of these biomarkers and expand the data set to include more isolates for each of the species. This approach holds promise for developing more cost-effective and rapid diagnostic tools in clinical microbiology, ultimately improving patient outcomes and infection control.</p>

Excessive IMF deposition, commonly observed in human obesity and aging, negatively affects skeletal muscle function. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in muscle and fat development, as well as in the progression of related diseases. However, the specific functions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in IMF deposition have not been extensively studied.We screened adipogenic differentiation-related circRNAs using circRNA-seq combined with WGCNA. Functional analyses, including loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, were performed to determine the role of circGLIS3 in regulating adipogenesis in bovine intramuscular preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. A high-fat diet-induced mouse model was established to investigate the in vivo effects of circGLIS3 on skeletal muscle fat infiltration in mice (C57BL/6; n = 6 males). Mechanistic studies involved transcriptomic analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments.We screened and characterized a novel circRNA, circGLIS3, which is highly expressed in bovine IMF tissue and in the skeletal muscle of mice exhibiting fat infiltration. Functionally, circGLIS3 overexpression inhibited triglyceride synthesis (-16.19%, p < 0.01) and lipid droplet accumulation (-42.44%, p < 0.01) in intramuscular preadipocytes, concurrently downregulating the expression of key adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). CircGLIS3 knockdown promoted triglyceride synthesis (+28.32%, p < 0.05) and lipid droplet accumulation (+47.40%, p < 0.01) in intramuscular preadipocytes, accompanied by a significant upregulation of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). Notably, circGLIS3 exhibits more than 80% sequence homology among bovine, mouse, and human species. CircGLIS3 overexpression inhibited triglyceride synthesis (-28.84%, p < 0.01) and lipid droplet accumulation (-46.49%, p < 0.01) in 3T3-L1 cells, concurrently downregulating the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). Overexpression of circGLIS3 reduced skeletal muscle fat infiltration induced by high-fat diet in mice (-57.88%, p < 0.05). Mechanistically, circGLIS3 acts as a sponge for miR-21-3p, increasing the expression of its target gene, LEPR (+56.05%, p < 0.01), and promoting the phosphorylation level of its downstream signalling protein, AMPKα (+68.68%, p < 0.01).CircGLIS3 inhibits bovine intramuscular adipogenesis by regulating the miR-21-3p/LEPR/AMPK axis, reducing fat infiltration in mouse skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that circGLIS3 is a promising target for improving meat quality in livestock, and as a potential therapeutic marker for alleviating skeletal muscle fat infiltration associated with obesity.</p>

To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain's biology-the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.</p>

TFEA.ChIP is a ChIP-seq-based TF enrichment analysis tool that addresses this by linking TF binding profiles to differentially expressed genes through experimentally supported cis-regulatory element (CRE)-gene associations. Unlike motif- or heuristic-based approaches, TFEA.ChIP adopts a biologically grounded strategy by intersecting TF binding data from ReMap2022 with regulatory maps from ENCODE's rE2G and CREdb. To overcome the high context-specificity of rE2G associations, we developed filtering strategies based on confidence scores and recurrence across biosamples. Benchmarking on 369 curated gene sets from the MSigDB C2 CGP collection showed that recurrence-based filtering significantly improved accuracy, outperforming the original GeneHancer-based implementation and leading tools including BARTv2.0, Lisa, ChEA3, and HOMER. A case study on hypoxia further validated the method, demonstrating accurate and pathway-specific enrichment of HIF-related TFs using both overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Additionally, the updated implementation of TFEA.ChIP in R/Bioconductor introduces several user-friendly features, including automated analysis workflows and expression-based filtering of candidate TFs. These additions streamline the integration of TFEA.ChIP into standard RNA-seq analysis pipelines, enabling more efficient and reproducible workflows.

Machine learning-based age-estimators (such as epigenetic clocks) offer a robust method for capturing biomarkers that strongly correlate with age. In principle, we can use these estimators to find novel targets for aging research, which can then be used for developing drugs that can extend the healthspan. However, methylation-based clocks do not provide direct mechanistic insight into aging, limiting their utility for drug discovery. Here, we describe a method for building tissue-specific bulk RNA-seq-based age-estimators that can be used to identify the ageprint. The ageprint is a set of genes that drive baseline healthy aging in a tissue-specific, developmentally-linked fashion. Using our age estimator, SkeletAge, we narrowed down the ageprint of human skeletal muscles to 128 genes, of which 26 genes have never been studied in the context of aging or aging-associated phenotypes. The ageprint of skeletal muscles can be linked to known phenotypes of skeletal muscle aging and development, which further supports our hypothesis that the ageprint genes drive (healthy) aging along the growth-development-aging axis, which is separate from (biological) aging that takes place due to illness or stochastic damage. Lastly, we show that using our method, we can find druggable targets for aging research and use the ageprint to accurately assess the effect of therapeutic interventions, which can further accelerate the discovery of longevity-enhancing drugs.</p>

Here, we introduce the TaRGET II Data Portal (https://data.targetepigenomics.org/), a repository of exposomes from mice exposed to environmental toxicants, including arsenic (As), lead (Pb), bisphenol A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and air pollution (PM2.5). Sequencing assays capturing changes in chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, gene expression, and post-translational histone modifications from multiple centers were quality-controlled and uniformly processed. The datasets cover multiple tissues collected at four time points: 3 weeks, 5 weeks, 20 weeks, and 40 weeks. The TaRGET II Data Portal offers an efficient way to browse, search, visualize, and download relevant datasets and associated metadata, serving as a key resource for studying the impact of environmental toxicant exposures on disease susceptibility for the broader scientific community.</p>

D-SPIN models the transcriptional state of cells as a set of individual genes or gene programs that interact through a condition-dependent spin network model or Markov random field. A single unified network is learned across multiple conditions, where the perturbations modulate the activity of individual network nodes. The architecture allows information integration between different perturbation conditions and efficient inference algorithms that scale to thousands of genes, thousands of conditions, and millions of single cells. For interpretability, D-SPIN can also operate at the level of co-expressing gene programs, which are extracted via unsupervised orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (oNMF). Here we present the theory and detailed procedures for applying D-SPIN to build program-level or gene-level network models from single-cell data. With a public immune dictionary dataset, we illustrate multiple applications of D-SPIN, including identifying gene programs and network modules, classifying perturbation responses of cytokines, and nominating key regulators mediating cytokine responses.</p>

It integrates both knowledge based and machine learning approaches to predict metabolites for small molecules using one of seven modules: abiotic, environmental, CYP450, phase II, enzyme commission-based, human gut microbial, and all human metabolism. It also provides a customizable sequence prediction module that allows users to simulate multi-step metabolic transformations by chaining among the first six different modules. BioTransformer4.0 can make predictions more efficiently and accurately than the previous version, as it includes more than 130 new reaction rules, and also an optional validation module to improve the efficiency by restricting the number of predicted metabolites, due to their similarity among real human metabolites. We evaluated its performance by running the six-step all-human metabolism prediction on the DrugBank dataset of 2,457 known biotransformations, and the PhytoHub dataset of 633 known biotransformations (R) achieving recall values of 87.2% (resp., 91.6%) for the DrugBank (resp.,PhytoHub) datasets.</p>

Current pest control strategies primarily rely on chemical pesticides, leading to human and environmental constraints. Additionally, the emergence of insecticide-resistant populations underscores the urgent need for more specific and efficient pest management strategies. The development of novel techniques for controlling this insect pest requires rigorous interrogation of its physiology and interactions with host plants at a molecular/genetic level. To enable future research in this vein, we sequenced and assembled a draft L. coffeella genome using PacBio highly accurate long-reads (HiFi). Our assembly is comprised of 1615 contigs showing fragmentation, yet the majority of gene content is represented (BUSCO complete = 91.7%). We annotated 17467 protein-coding genes within our assembly, seven of which are core components of the small interfering RNA machinery. The expression of these genes was further confirmed via qPCR. This analysis - and the underlying genomic data - highlights potential targets for RNAi-based biopesticide development and will serve as the foundation for important future research aimed at protecting global coffee production from one of its most destructive pests.</p>

Open or error-tolerant searches can address this limitation, but at the cost of increased difficulty in downstream interpretation of the results and quantification. We and others have previously described "mass offset" or multi-notch searches that sit in between closed and open searches, allowing simultaneous search for hundreds of modifications with more straightforward downstream interpretation than open search. The original mass offset searches were closer to open search, lacking the ability to restrict modifications to specific amino acids. Here, we describe a new "detailed" mass offset (DMO) search implemented in the MSFragger search engine, which allows each mass offset to have its own site restrictions and fragmentation rules. The benefits of DMO search over existing mass offset searches are shown with three example searches of complex modification sets: nearly one hundred post-translational modifications, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP)-derived modifications, and amino acid substitutions. The DMO search further improves the interpretability of results by reducing ambiguity in site localization, particularly when modifications have overlapping masses, and provides benefits that scale with the complexity of the search.</p>

Expanding this vocabulary to hundreds of non-canonical amino acids allows the engineering of proteins with novel function and activity, and is of great interest for the discovery of novel drugs such as macrocyclic peptides. Here we present NCFlow, a flow-based generative model capable of incorporating any arbitrary non-canonical amino acid into a given protein. To supplement sparse training data in the Protein Data Bank, NCFlow is pretrained on millions of small molecule structures and a large set of protein-ligand complexes before finetuning on native non-canonicals found within proteins in the Protein Data Bank. We show that NCFlow outperforms AlphaFold3-based methods in the structure prediction of unseen non-canonical amino acids. We present a peptide design pipeline akin to in silico deep mutational scanning, and propose a novel scoring strategy using a combination of deep learning-based and molecular dynamics-based alchemical binding free energy calculations to identify improved peptide variants. We apply the method on four protein-peptide complex test cases, and observe that incorporating non-canonicals can significantly improve binding affinity by up to-7.0 kcal/mol. Thus, NCFlow can be easily integrated into existing protein design platforms to further improve its properties outside of what is capable with standard amino acids.</p>

Although metabolic pathway databases are growing, many metabolic reactions, termed orphan enzymes, have not been annotated to gene sequences, which hinders functional annotation in genomic analysis. Moreover, protein databases contain many proteins of unknown function. Owing to this gap between known proteins and enzymatic reactions, various proteins of unknown function may be orphan enzymes; however, available tools cannot adequately predict these links. In this study, we developed DeepRES, an AI-based framework for comprehensive enzyme screening, to explore novel enzyme candidates from proteins of unknown function for reactions of interest. DeepRES implements enzyme screening via two steps: classification of enzymes and non-enzymes and prediction of catalytic capabilities for enzyme-reaction pairs. The two deep learning models comprising DeepRES showed comparable or superior performance to that of existing software. We performed screening of 1,255 orphan enzymes involved in the microbiome using DeepRES and successfully identified candidate proteins for 897 orphan enzymes. We then used those candidates as references for genomic analysis and explored novel biosynthetic gene clusters from microbial genomes to obtain promising candidate gene clusters, including those related to anthocyanin degradation. Comprehensive enzyme screening via DeepRES, which is the first computational tool designed to associate orphan enzymes with proteins of unknown function, is expected to facilitate high-throughput identification of orphan enzyme-encoding genes. Furthermore, DeepRES can be easily integrated into the current genomic analysis pipeline to extend the functional annotation.</p>

Typically, researchers generate hypotheses by carefully analyzing available information and making logical connections, which are then tested. The accelerating growth of biomedical literature makes it increasingly difficult to keep pace with connections between biological entities emerging across biomedical research. Recently developed automated means of generating hypotheses can generate many more hypotheses than can be easily tested. One such approach involves literature-based discovery (LBD) systems such as Serial KinderMiner (SKiM), which surfaces putative A-B-C links derived from term co-occurrence. However, LBD systems leave three critical gaps: (i) they find statistical associations, not biological relationships; (ii) they can produce false-positive leads; and (iii) they do not assess agreement with a hypothesis in question. As a result, LBD search results often require costly manual curation to be of practical utility to the researcher. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to automate much of this curation step, but standalone LLMs are hampered by hallucinations, lack of transparency in information sources, and the inability to reference data not included in the training corpus. Results We introduce SKiM-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines SKiM's co-occurrence search and retrieval with frontier LLMs to evaluate user-defined hypotheses. For every chosen A-B-C SKiM hit, SKiM-GPT retrieves appropriate PubMed abstract texts, filters out irrelevant abstracts with a fine-tuned relevance model, and prompts an LLM to evaluate the user's hypothesis, given the relevant abstracts. Importantly, the SKiM-GPT system is transparent and human-verifiable: it displays the retrieved abstracts, the hypothesis score, and a justification for the score grounded in the texts and written in natural language. On a benchmark consisting of 14 disease-gene-drug hypotheses, SKiM-GPT achieves strong ordinal agreement with four expert biologists (Cohen's {kappa} = 0.84), demonstrating SKiM-GPT's ability to replicate expert judgment. Conclusions SKiM-GPT is open-source ( https://github.com/stewart-lab/skimgpt ) and available through a web interface ( https://skim.morgridge.org ), enabling both wet-lab and computational researchers to systematically and efficiently evaluate biomedical hypotheses at scale.</p>

People in Kalimantan (Indonesia) collect young leaves and fronds from wild populations for use as vegetables or medicines to treat conditions, such as ulcers, stomachaches, fever, diarrhoea, and skin infections. The young leaves and fronds of S. palustris contain flavonoids, polyphenols, and anthocyanins. Here, we present a high-quality organ-specific transcriptome assembly of S. palustris based on long-read RNA sequencing of young leaves. Results: The de novo assembly yielded 47,759 transcripts, with an N50 of 1,524 bp and a BUSCO completeness of 66.6%, consistent with organ-specific transcriptomes. Functional annotation identified key structural and regulatory genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, including genes for chalcone synthase (CHS) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). We further analysed the expression of the selected CHS and DFR genes via qRT-PCR of three phenotypically contrasting young leaf samples. Although no strong correlation was observed between gene expression levels and anthocyanin pigmentation, the results suggest that complex regulation involves post-transcriptional control or developmental timing. Conclusions: This study provides the first long-read transcriptomic resource for S. palustris and valuable data for future investigations of secondary metabolism and gene regulation in ferns. Our findings complement broader fern transcriptome studies by offering tissue-specific resolution and a focused view of pigment biosynthesis.</p>

Here, focusing on phosphorus, an essential nutrient for plant growth, we developed a low-cost and non-invasive biosensor to visualize and predict early stress signaling in plants. By combining plant phosphate (Pi)-deficiency-induced promoter systems with fungal self-sustained bioluminescence systems genetically engineered into tobacco plants, we created sensor plants that emitted more light when experiencing Pi deficiency. This light emission correlated with the expressions of known phosphate-responsive genes and the total phosphorus content in plants, and decreased during Pi recovery conditions, demonstrating the responsiveness and robustness of the sensor plants in reflecting endogenous phosphorus deficiency. The sensor plants responded primarily to Pi deficiency rather than nitrogen or potassium deficiencies and were sensitive to different ranges of external Pi concentrations. Additionally, when grafted onto tomato and chili pepper plants, the sensor plants responded to external phosphorus deficiency, showing promise for monitoring stress signals in different crop species. Using deep-learning-based image analysis techniques, auto-luminescent signals of sensor plants could be detected and used to predict phosphorus deficiency. This study outlines a strategy of creating a self-luminous biosensor to visualize phosphate dynamics in planta and predict nutrient deficiency for sustainable agriculture.</p>

Early-stage phenomic selection, the process of using high-dimensional secondary traits to predict target traits, may accelerate improvement. We evaluated whether seed traits derived from image scans could be used to predict germination traits in three perennial crop candidate species: sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), and silflower (Silphium integrifolium). Over 20,000 seeds were scanned, and PlantCV was used to extract 692 hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color features along with five morphological traits. We demonstrated that seed color, morphology, and germination traits were all influenced by maternal family, but patterns of correlation between germination traits and color and morphology traits are complex. To enable prediction from high-dimensional seed traits, we constructed relationship matrices from combinations of HSV and morphology features for use in phenomic selection models to predict germination proportion and timing. Model performance varied by trait, species, and cohort, and in many cases, predictions were significantly better than chance. HSV features, when combined with morphology, often yielded the most accurate predictions, with performance reaching a maximum of r = 0.33. These results demonstrate the potential of low-cost, image-based phenomic data to inform early-stage selection and support the development of sustainable perennial crops.</p>

Unlike the canonical soluble nucleo-cytosolic forms, these proteins were predicted to have transmembrane (TM) domains and, apparently, should be localized on some kind of cell membranes. To date, 95 predicted TM-containing phosphotransmitter (TM-HPt) homologs were found in 61 plant species belonging to different clades, taxa and groups: bryophytes, gymnosperms, mono- and dicotyledons. The conserved HPt motif with phosphorylatable histidine was preserved in the most of TM-HPts under study that allowed us to consider these proteins potentially active in MSP signaling. For the found TM-HPts, a Bayesian analysis at the DNA level was performed and a relevant phylogenetic tree was constructed. According to evolutionary relationships, plant TM-HPts were divided into two main groups corresponding to Arabidopsis AHP1-3,5,6 and AHP4 orthologs. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the expression of the most of the investigated TM-HPt-encoding genes. Their moderate-to-low overall transcription rate may be a consequence of inducible and/or tissue-specific expression. Using molecular modeling methods, a variety of potential spatial organizations of several such proteins are demonstrated. Possible roles of TM-HPts as modulators of MSP signaling pathway and corresponding putative mechanisms of their action are suggested.</p>

Golden Gate and Modular Cloning (MoClo), two powerful technologies enabling the scale-up of cloning workflows, play a central role for efficient circuit construction. These workflows include a number of dry-lab tasks, which are time-consuming and error-prone at scale. Currently, no software tool is available to handle these tasks in a dedicated, time-saving, and user-friendly manner. We present InSillyClo, an open-source web application to assist large-scale Golden Gate cloning and MoClo workflows. It supports an easy specification of genetic designs at any scale, followed by the automated generation of comprehensive workflow-related data. Moreover, InSillyClo leverages Modular Cloning with a versatile typing system of parts to generate user-defined workflows. InSillyClo is open source, accessible with or without user registration, and can also be used locally.</p>

However, the emergence of neutralization resistance to bNAbs occurs rapidly due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1. Previous studies have suggested the use of in silico methods to effectively predict the resistance of HIV-1 isolates to bNAbs. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach called BRAVE (Bnab Resistance Analysis Via Evolutionary scale modeling 2) designed to predict HIV-1 resistance against 33 known bNAbs. This innovative tool employs a Random Forests classifier that uses a protein language model to reliably capture protein features. Results: BRAVE outperformed leading resistance prediction tools on various performance metrics, attaining the highest performance in established classification measures including accuracy, area under the curve, logarithmic loss, and F1-score. Importantly, rigorous statistical comparisons (p<0.001) show that BRAVE is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art neutralization prediction tools. BRAVE will facilitate informed decisions of antibody usage and sequence-based monitoring of viral escape in clinical settings. Availability and implementation BRAVE software is available for download under GitHub (https://github.com/kiryst/BRAVE/tree/master).</p>

Field-based phenotyping is pivotal in bridging genomic data with crop performance, offering a promising pathway for predictive modeling in diverse environments. This review traces the evolution of phenotyping from high-throughput sensor data for trait extraction to advanced modeling approaches that integrate multi-temporal data, latent space representations, and learned crop models. This evolution is exemplified mostly by morphology- and growth-related examples from the core expertise of the authors. High-throughput trait extraction, facilitated by advanced imaging and sensor technologies, has enabled rapid and accurate characterization of complex traits essential for crop improvement. Carrier platforms, such as drones, rovers, and gantries, have played a critical role in capturing high-resolution data across large fields, enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of phenotypic data. Publicly available datasets have further accelerated research by providing standardized, high-quality data for benchmarking and model development beyond the realm of crop growth as for example in crop photosynthesis. These advancements are transforming phenotyping into a predictive science capable of informing breeding and management decisions. As phenotyping methodologies continue to evolve, the integration of machine learning and data-driven approaches offers new opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy and understanding genotype-environment interactions. While challenges such as data heterogeneity, scalability, and cost remain, we highlight key gaps and propose solutions, underscoring phenotyping's critical role in future agricultural innovation.</p>

The present study aimed to explore this potential using publicly available datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases to analyze α-KG-related genes and establish the α-KG Index (AKGI). By assessing the predictive performance of the AKGI model, the results demonstrated its capability to predict survival outcomes in patients with GC. Notably, high AKGI scores were associated with worse prognoses. Building on these findings, the associations between AKGI and clinical variables, immune cell infiltration and tumor mutation characteristics were assessed, further identifying potential therapeutic drugs for patients with high AKGI scores. Additionally, by analyzing signaling pathways and biological functions correlated with AKGI, the regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of α-KG in GC were elucidated. The findings of these analyses were further evaluated using cellular experiments, where α-KG treatment was demonstrated to significantly inhibit GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, the present study successfully constructed and validated the AKGI as a potential prognostic biomarker for GC. The findings indicate that AKGI can identify patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy, enhance diagnostic precision and improve clinical outcomes in GC management. Moreover, AKGI offers a valuable framework for advancing the understanding of the role and mechanisms of α-KG in GC.</p>

Salinity stress tolerance (SST) is a complex trait, both physiologically and genetically, and is conferred at various levels of plant functional organization. As both the sustainability and profitability of agricultural production systems are critically dependent on SST, plant breeders are trying to design and develop salinity-smart crop plants capable of thriving under high salinity conditions. The accessibility of extreme-quality reference genomes for cultivated crops, naturally salinity-smart plants, and crop wild relatives has fast-tracked the discovery of key genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), marker development, genotyping assays and molecular breeding products with improved SST. Employing fast-forward breeding tools, namely genomic selection (GS), haplotype-based breeding (HBB), artificial intelligence (AI) and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), has shown influence not only for fast-tracking genetic gains but also for reducing the time and cost of developing commercial cultivars with enhanced SST and yield stability. This review discusses the advancement and prospects of various genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) tools, including genome sequencing, QTL mapping, GWAS, GS, HBB, pan-genomics, single-cell/tissue genomics and phenotyping, epigenomics and transgenomics, to exploit the genetic landscape for improving SST. Additionally, we explore the integration of HTP and AI, which demonstrates how these innovative approaches can optimize breeding efficiency and guide large-scale breeding efforts for designing salinity-smart crops to ensure sustainable agriculture and global food security. The collective adoption of these tools suggests bridging the gap between research and field application to deliver stress-smart varieties designed for saline-affected regions worldwide.</p>

Their activation is triggered by the binding of T cell receptors (TCRs) to epitopes presented on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. However, experimentally identifying antigens that could be recognizable by T cells and possess immunogenic properties is resource-intensive, with most candidates proving non-immunogenic, underscoring the need for computational tools to predict peptide-MHC (pMHC) and TCR binding. Despite extensive efforts, accurately predicting TCR-antigen binding pairs remains challenging due to the vast diversity of TCRs.</p>

While structural biology and chemoproteomics approaches have generated extensive data on cysteine ligandability, these complementary data types remain largely disconnected. Here, we present TopCysteineDB, a comprehensive resource integrating structural information from the PDB with chemoproteomics data from activity-based protein profiling experiments. Analysis of the complete PDB yielded 264,234 unique cysteines, while the proteomics dataset encompasses 41,898 detectable cysteines across the human proteome. Using TopCovPDB, an automated classification pipeline complemented by manual curation, we identified 787 covalent cysteines and systematically categorized other functional roles, including metal-binding, cofactor-binding, and disulfide bonds. Mapping residue-wise structural information to sequence space enabled cross-referencing between structural and proteomics data, creating a unified view of cysteine ligandability. For TopCySPAL, a machine learning model was developed, integrating structural features and proteomics data, achieving strong predictive performance (AUROC: 0.964, AUPRC: 0.914) and robust generalization to novel cases. TopCysteineDB and TopCySPAL are freely accessible through a webinterface, TopCysteineDBApp (https://topcysteinedb.hhu.de/), designed to facilitate exploration of cysteine sites across the human proteome. The interface provides an interactive visualization featuring a color-coded mapping of chemoproteomics data onto cysteine site structures and the highlighting of identified peptide sequences. It offers customizable dataset downloads and ligandability predictions for user-provided structures. This resource advances targeted covalent inhibitor design by providing integrated access to previously dispersed data types and enabling systematic analysis and prediction of cysteine ligandability.</p>
