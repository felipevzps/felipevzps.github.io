Borzoi, which models over ten thousand genomic assays including RNA-seq coverage from over half a megabase of sequence context alone promises to become an important foundation model in regulatory genomics, both for massively annotating variants and for further model development. However, the currently used relative positional encodings limit Borzoi's computational efficiency.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Current methods for predicting gene expression from histone modifications rely on arbitrary binary classification thresholds such as the median to distinguish between high and low expression for genes. This approach lacks biological justification, creates dataset-dependent classifications, and ignores the relative regulatory relationships between genes that are often more biologically meaningful than absolute cutoffs. We introduce a novel pairwise ranking approach that compares relative expression levels between gene pairs based on their histone modification patterns, eliminating arbitrary threshold selection. Evaluation using the REMC E066 and GSE76344 datasets showed that our pairwise classification framework demonstrated consistent ranking performance in both datasets. The ablation study found that only a subset of histone modification types is necessary, giving evidence of redundancy in the biological code.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Seasonal changes in testosterone mediate the transition from reduced singing in the non-breeding season to high song rates in the early breeding season in male temperate songbirds, a process accompanied by marked neurogenesis in song control regions of the brain. However, the resulting genetic changes and their association with the subsequent behavioral, neuroanatomical and reproductive changes remain poorly understood. Here, we compared gene expression in HVC, a major song control nucleus, between the non-breeding and breeding season in male northern house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and we examined associations with HVC volume, plasma testosterone concentrations, and testes size. Differential gene expression analysis identified three genes (CLIP4, FAM169A, and TTR) consistently linked to seasonal transitions from non-breeding to three breeding stages (pre-laying, egg-laying and incubation). Notably, TTR, which transports thyroid hormone (TH), was highly expressed in the nonbreeding season, consistent with a possible role of TH in regulating seasonal shifts in song output and structure. We also identified seasonal changes in networks of genes related to neural connectivity, cellular restructuring, and cell migration. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed gene clusters specifically correlated with testosterone and HVC volume. Testosterone-associated genes included genes involved in neural circuit remodeling, chromatin organization, and cytoskeletal dynamics, consistent with testosterone-mediated regulation of these neuroanatomical changes. Genes linked to seasonal increases in HVC volume were involved in neuronal restructuring and neuron migration, implicating these genes in seasonal neurogenesis. Together, our findings link novel gene expression patterns to hormone regulation and neurogenesis underlying seasonal transitions in birdsong.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> The routine exclusion of admixed individuals from traditional Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) due to concerns about spurious associations has hindered genetic analyses involving multiple ancestries. Tractor GWAS addresses this issue by incorporating local ancestry into its analysis, empowering identification of ancestry-enriched hits and generating ancestry-specific summary statistics. However, Tractor requires accurate genomic phasing and local ancestry inference as prerequisite steps, which requires additional bioinformatics expertise and decision points regarding reference panel setup. To streamline, harmonize, and automate this process, we present a scalable Nextflow workflow that integrates all necessary steps, minimizing the need for manual intervention while remaining modular and customizable. The workflow supports multiple commonly used tools and offers flexibility in how Tractor is implemented. To demonstrate its utility, we applied this pipeline to analyze 32 blood biomarkers in 6,245 two-way AFR-EUR admixed individuals from the UK Biobank. This pipeline ran efficiently at scale, replicated known associations, and identified novel ancestry-specific loci. These novel associations were largely driven by variants present on African ancestral tracts but absent from European tracts, underscoring the value of local ancestry-aware methods in uncovering previously missed genetic signals. By enabling the efficient analysis of admixed individuals, our workflow facilitates Tractor use, paving the way for more broader genetic discovery.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Ribozymes are central to models of RNA-based primordial life. Understanding how ribozymes emerge from RNA populations under changing selection pressures is essential for reconstructing early biochemical systems. In vitro selection has been instrumental in isolating ribozymes from combinatorial populations; however, their population dynamics during selection remains poorly characterized. By analyzing high-throughput sequencing data from all eight rounds of an in vitro selection experiment, consisting of over 5 million unique sequences, we were able to track how sequences rise and fall in abundance during selection. We found that the most abundant sequences emerged early and maintained their dominance, suggesting that only a few cycles of selection-amplification may be sufficient to isolate well-adapted ribozymes. Nucleotide conservation analysis of the dominant ribozyme family and experimental characterization of rare variants indicated that abundance did not always predict activity. Our analyses show that sequence complementarity with the substrate emerged as a common feature in as early as the first round, highlighting early convergence of diverse sequence populations on a beneficial catalytic strategy. Our work presents the most detailed description of ribozyme population dynamics during an in vitro selection experiment and provides a high-resolution view of how RNA sequences compete for survival and propagation.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Natural products (NPs) are key to biological function and adaptation, with their distribution shaped by complex evolutionary and ecological forces. While it may seem reasonable to assume that closely related species produce chemically similar NPs, this assumption has not been systematically tested at a broad taxonomic scale. Here, we evaluate whether evolutionary (taxonomic) proximity correlates with chemical similarity in large-scale data from the Lotus database of NPs. We use five deep learning-based encoders, including Chemformer and SMILES Transformer, to embed NPs into a high-dimensional "chemical space." Our results demonstrate that, for flowering plants (Magnoliopsida) and conifers (Pinopsida), species separated by shorter taxonomic distances tend to produce significantly more similar NPs. Similar trends are observed for Fungi and Metazoa, albeit with some complications, possibly due to horizontal gene transfer, convergent evolution, and/or incomplete coverage in the dataset used for NPs. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary tree can be statistically recovered in a chemical space of NPs, provided that this space is constructed with appropriate deep learning techniques, and provide a new computational framework to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of secondary metabolism. These results can inform drug design strategies, for example by enabling the reconstruction of NPs from poorly studied or extinct species.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Differential graph inference is a critical analytical technique that enables researchers to accurately identify the variables and their interactions that change under different conditions. By comparing two conditions, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the differences between them. Currently, the mainstream methods in differential graph inference are mathematical optimization algorithms, including sparse optimization based on Gaussian graphical models or sparse Bayesian regression. These methods can eliminate many false positives in graphs, but at the cost of heavy reliance on the prior distributions of data or parameters, and they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To address these challenges, we introduce a new architecture called the Flippable Siamese Differential Neural Network (FSDiffNet). We originally established the concept of flippability and the theoretical foundation of flippable neural networks, laying the groundwork for building a flippable neural network. This theoretical framework guided the design of architecture and components, including the SoftSparse activation function and high-dilation circular padding diagonal convolution. FSDiffNet uses large-scale pre-training techniques to acquire differential features and perform differential graph inference. Through experiments with simulated and real datasets, FSDiffNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple metrics, effectively inferring key differential factors related to conditions such as autism and breast cancer. This proves the effectiveness of FSDiffNet as a solution for differential graph inference challenges.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Vitamin D is a key micronutrient in vertebrate health that influences musculoskeletal function and likely modulates immune responses in tissues such as the skin. In aquaculture, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are particularly vulnerable to skin pathogens, notably the ectoparasitic salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). As the skin represents the first line of immunological defence, its capacity to mediate host-pathogen interactions may be influenced by dietary vitamin D. This study investigated the transcriptomic response of salmon skin following six months of dietary vitamin D supplementation, with a focus on immune-related gene expression. A total of 113 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, 46 of which are implicated in inflammation, immune signalling, and both innate and adaptive immunity. These DEGs were further compared to published RNA-seq data of salmon skin challenged with L. salmonis. Notably, while pro-inflammatory genes were regulated in opposing directions, heat shock proteins, lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides were consistently upregulated under both conditions. These findings suggest that vitamin D may modulate cutaneous immune responses by dampening inflammation and enhancing innate defences, potentially improving resistance to skin-associated pathogens such as salmon lice.</p>

Bovine TB remains recalcitrant to eradication in endemic countries where current diagnostics fail to identify all infected animals. While blood-based RNA biomarkers identified through machine learning have shown accurate discrimination of hTB-positive and hTB-negative individuals, similar approaches have not been explored for bTB. Here, we use RNA-seq and machine learning to investigate the utility of peripheral blood mRNA as a host-response biomarker for bTB using data from Ireland, the UK and the US. We identify a 30-gene signature and a 273-gene elastic net classifier that differentiate bTB-positive from bTB-negative cattle, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.986/0.900 for the former and 0.968/0.938 for the latter in training and testing, respectively. These two classifiers produced high sensitivity and specificity values ([‚â•] 0.853 for both metrics) in the testing set. Additionally, we show that they robustly distinguish bTB+ animals from those infected with other bacterial or viral pathogens (AUC [‚â•] 0.819). These RNA-based classifiers accurately diagnose bTB and differentiate bTB from other diseases, representing a promising tool for augmenting current diagnostics to advance bTB eradication efforts in endemic regions.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Improving the efficiency of data compression remains essential for feature selection and data modelling. Current approaches for compressing epigenomic/genomic data highly rely on autoencoder that requires substantial computing resources, parameter fine-tuning, training, and time. Here, we developed a training-free, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based method, for data compression with high efficiency and full interpretability. Our FFT method compresses epigenomic data of histone modification up to 1,000-fold while still maintaining high reconstruction fidelity (cosine similarity, 99.7%), does not require any training and completes ultrafast within 70 milliseconds on GPU or 20 seconds on CPU opposite to extensive training in hours/days for autoencoder on GPU/CPU, and offers full interpretability of compressed features from frequency components of original signals in contrast to the uninterpretable ''black box'' from autoencoder. This enables high accuracy in the classification model prediction (AUC, 0.960). Thus, our novel FFT method represents a major paradigm shift in data compression.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Spatial transcriptomics technologies have provided invaluable insights by profiling gene expression alongside precise spatial information. However, they encounter high costs, data sparsity, and limited resolution, hindering their broader adoption and utility. Moreover, the lack of flexible simulators capable of generating high-fidelity simulated data has impeded the development of computational tools for spatial transcriptomic data analysis. To this end, we introduce STADiffuser, a versatile deep generative model that leverages diffusion modeling for accurate simulation of spatial transcriptomic data. STADiffuser employs a two-stage architecture: an autoencoder with a graph attention mechanism for learning spot embeddings, followed by a latent diffusion model integrated with a spatial denoising network for data generation. STADiffuser is the first simulator designed for spatial transcriptomic data, capable of handling multiple samples and 3D coordinates while supporting user-defined conditions. STADiffuser facilitates various downstream analyses, including accurate imputation, super-resolution, and full-slice generation. Furthermore, its generative scheme enables in silico experiments, thereby enhancing the statistical power in detecting differentially expressed genes and identifying cell-type-specific genes while effectively controlling confounding factors. Notably, STADiffuser scales to millions of spots and supports the full-view 3D modeling of a marmoset cerebellum atlas with over 20 million spots, enabling detailed investigations from arbitrary viewing angles.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Rationale: The mechanisms controlling lateral root emergence in monocots, particularly the role of the exodermis, are poorly understood. We investigated how natural variation in the Brachypodium distachyon stress response shapes root system architecture by modulating cell wall dynamics. Methods: We used root tip excision to synchronize lateral root development across natural accessions. The resulting phenotypes were analysed using comparative transcriptomics, biochemical lignin quantification, confocal Raman spectroscopy, and chemical inhibition of lignin biosynthesis. Key Results: Two distinct root system architectures, 'pine tree' and 'fishbone', were identified. The 'fishbone' phenotype results from an emergence-specific defect caused by the premature and intense lignification of the exodermis. This was driven by the transcriptional upregulation of lignin biosynthesis genes and was rescued by a lignin inhibitor. Main Conclusion: Stress-induced exodermal lignification acts as a mechanical 'brake' on lateral root emergence. This positions the exodermis as a key regulatory hub that integrates environmental cues with developmental programs to control RSA plasticity in grasses.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> RNA regulators offer a promising path for building complex, orthogonal circuits due to their low resource demands and design flexibility. In this study we explore their potential as signaling molecules in communication between synthetic cells. Specifically, we engineer porous polymer cell mimics to produce, emit and receive two types of small synthetic RNA regulators that are required to activate expression of a reporter at the level of transcription and translation. We distribute this AND gate circuit in receiver and two types of sender cell mimics to compare the distributed logic computation to the behavior of the circuit in well-mixed, bulk cell-free expression reactions. Analyzing different densities and spatial arrangements of senders and receivers, we reveal spatiotemporal gradients in RNA signals and identify configurations that increase specific activation. With small regulatory RNAs, the engineering toolbox for communication between synthetic cells expands to include a programmable class of signalling molecules. The rapid turnover of RNA suggests applications in establishing dynamic signaling gradients in communities of synthetic cells.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Organic acids such as fumaric acid are widely used in the food and beverage industry as acidulants and preservatives, while also serving as versatile precursors for industrially relevant compounds. Fumaric acid is still predominantly produced through petroleum-derived processes. To enhance production efficiency and diversify supply, we are engineering Kluyveromyces marxianus as a biosynthetic platform from renewable feedstocks. In previous work, we have established K. marxianus Y-1190 as a host for lactose valorization based on its high growth rate on lactose and its tolerance for acid conditions. Here, we establish a trifunctional genome-wide library for K. marxianus using CRISPR activation, interference, and deletion to allow identification of gene expression perturbations that enhance tolerance to fumaric acid. We determined that deletion of ATP7, encoding a subunit of the mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase, and overexpression of QDR2 and QDR3, two previously uncharacterized members of the 12-spanner H antiporter (DHA1) family in K. marxianus, can enhance fumaric acid tolerance. We also found that integrated overexpression of both QDR2 and QDR3 in a {Delta}FUM1 background strain improved titers of fumaric acid production from 0.26 g L-1 to 2.16 g L-1. Together, these results highlight roles for membrane transport and mitochondrial function in enabling fumaric acid tolerance and production in K. marxianus.</p>

We introduce a {surd}t-warped wave transform that concentrates long-time structure into compact spectral peaks, improving time-frequency localization for sublinear temporal dynamics. On open fungal datasets (fs{approx}1 Hz) the method yields sharper spectra than STFT, stable {tau}-band trajectories, and species-specific multi-scale "signatures". Coupled with spike statistics and a lightweight ML pipeline, we obtain reproducible diagnostics under leave-one-file-out validation. All analyses are timestamped, audited, and designed for low-RAM devices.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Large language model (LLM) agents hold promise for accelerating biomedical research and development (R&D). Several biomedical agents have recently been proposed, but their evaluation has largely been restricted to question answering (e.g., LAB-Bench) or narrow bioinformatics tasks. Presently, there remains a lack of benchmarks evaluating agent capability in multi-step data analysis workflows or in solving the machine learning (ML) challenges central to AI-driven therapeutics development, such as perturbation response modeling or drug toxicity prediction. We introduce BioML-bench, the first benchmarking suite for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end biomedical ML tasks. BioML-bench spans four domains (protein engineering, single-cell omics, biomedical imaging, and drug discovery) with tasks that require agents to parse a task description, build a pipeline, implement models, and submit predictions graded by established metrics (e.g., AUROC, Spearman). We evaluate four open-source agents: two biomedical specialists (STELLA, Biomni) and two generalists (AIDE, MLAgentBench). On average, agents underperform relative to human baselines, and biomedical specialization does not confer a consistent advantage. We also found that agents which attempted more diverse ML strategies more often tended to score highest, suggesting that architecture and scaffolding may be stronger determinants of performance. These findings underscore both the potential and current limits of agentic systems for biomedical ML, and highlight the need for systematic, reproducible evaluation. BioML-bench is provided open-source at https://github.com/science-machine/biomlbench.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Epigenetic modifications are dynamic and reversible, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Although several epigenetic drugs (epidrugs) have been clinically approved, their application in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains limited, and predictive biomarkers of response are lacking. Here, we present a mass spectrometry (MS)-based pharmacoepigenetic approach to profile histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) to identify signatures associated with epidrug sensitivity in T-ALL. Baseline hPTM landscapes were previously established by our group for 21 T-ALL cell lines using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Here, we treated these cell lines with a panel of nine epidrugs including anthracyclines, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Correlation of cell viability data with hPTM levels revealed distinct hPTM signatures linked to sensitivity for each drug class. These signatures were subsequently evaluated in T-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. However, we our analysis revealed substantial discepancies in hPTM sensitivity signatures compared to those observed in vitro. Co-variation network analysis highlighted divergence in hPTM-hPTM correlation between the two models, underscoring limitations of cell lines for modeling dynamic epigenetic regulation in vivo. Our findings establish a framework for MS-based hPTM profiling in T-ALL and emphasize the importance of model selection in developing predictive epigenetic biomarkers.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> ACTL6a is an essential component of SWI/SNF and expressed on the chromosome 3q26 cytoband, which is amplified in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). While ACTL6A is emerging as an oncogene, its role as a treatment target and mechanisms of transcription factor induction remain unknown. Here, we show that ACTL6A expression is a mediator of the Warburg effect, with ACTL6A knockdown inducing mitochondrial dependency and significantly decreasing levels of aerobic glycolysis. These effects lead to near complete attenuation of hypoxic cell growth by blunting induction of HIF1 and HIF2 protein expression. They also sensitize treatment resistant HNSCC cells to the tumor killing effects of the complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 in vivo. Using ATAC-seq, we identify ACTL6A as a mediator of chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor sites and find that it regulates upstream MAPK signaling through induction Ras and Galectin-1. These effects sensitize ACTL6A over-expressing cells to inhibition of glycolysis by MEK inhibitors. Our results link SWI/SNF subunit amplification with potentiation of MAPK signaling in HNSCC and provide a novel mechanism by which cancer cells drive aerobic glycolysis and reduce mitochondrial dependency. We leverage these findings to propose treatment strategies for hypoxic tumors with SWI/SNF subunit amplifications.</p>
