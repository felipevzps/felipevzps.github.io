Existing tools for processing multiomic single-cell Hi-C datasets have certain limitations for downstream bioinformatics analysis. We present map3C, a software tool designed to address these limitations. We demonstrate that map3C improves the quality of multiomic single-cell Hi-C data for analysis and its utility for identifying structural variant locations in the genome.</p>

To benchmark strategies, the SMaHT Network created a cell-line mixture (1:49) and produced ultra-deep whole-genome sequencing using short and long reads (five centers, 180-500x each). We assembled a reference of 44,008 mosaic SNVs and 2,059 Indels, cross-validation between platforms to expose limits of short-read analysis. We also partitioned the genome by mappability to examine the impact of genomic context, added a negative reference set, and accounted for culture-derived mutations. When seven institutions applied eleven algorithms to mixture data, call sets were largely discordant across tools and replicates, partly reflecting stochastic presence of low-VAF mutations in biological replicants. For >2% VAF SNVs, sensitivity and precision approached ~80% at > 300x, with little gain from additional sequencing. This work provides a comprehensive framework for reliable detection of low-VAF mutations in non-cancer tissues and a valuable resource for the community.</p>

Here, we use our PANCS-Binder technology to perform >1,300 independent selections of various library sizes and compositions of a randomized small protein to identify binders to a panel of 96 distinct target proteins. For successful selections, we discovered reproducible fitness landscapes that group into a few, target-specific, clusters. Each cluster defines a minimal binding motif whose frequency is inversely proportional to the number of specified amino acids (~2-8) and determines selection success, which is quantifiable by the density of binders to the target within a theoretical sequence space. We leverage these data to develop a supervised contrastive learning approach that discriminates binders from non-binders and demonstrates generalization beyond a threshold amount of data. Together, this framework renders PPI landscapes measurable and predictive, accelerating de novo binder discovery and optimization.</p>

These complexities make accurate pharmacogene interpretation more challenging, despite the crucial role pharmacogenomics plays in precision medicine. We developed deCYPher, a tool that generates personalized pharmacogenomic reports from haplotype-resolved assemblies. The tool enables analysis of all PharmVar 1A level genes, such as CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CYP4F2, DPYD, NUDT15, and SLCO1B1. Applied to all HPRC haplotypes (including both release 1 and release 2 data), deCYPher demonstrated high accuracy in resolving complex gene structures. In the case of CYP2D6, release 1 identified 6% gene multiplications, 6% full gene deletions, and 4% CYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrids. By contrast, release 2 demonstrated an increased prevalence of multiplications (14%) and hybrids (11%), while the frequency of full gene deletions remained comparable at 5%. Comparison with pb-StarPhase revealed discrepancies in 12 of 94 assemblies in the release 1 dataset. For instance, in sample HG02257, Aldy, Cyrius, and deCYPher consistently identified the genotype as *2/*35, whereas pb-StarPhase reported *2/*2. Notably, the *35-defining variants were present in the BAM and VCF files in the pb-StarPhase pipeline, but the local read depth over the *35-specific region was only 5x in HG02257-p, suggesting that the misclassification likely resulted from insufficient coverage - a known limitation of pb-StarPhase under low-depth conditions.</p>

Existing generative models for peptide design rely on simplistic discrete conditioning mechanisms rather than precise targeting of specific property values. We present PepGlider, a continuous property regularization framework that enables direct control over their specific values. The method achieves structured latent space with superior disentanglement quality and displays smooth property gradients along regularized dimension. In silico experimental results demonstrate that PepGlider enables independent control of naturally correlated properties, and supports both de novo generation and targeted optimization of existing peptides. PepGlider applied to antimicrobial peptide design allows generation of candidates with desired antibacterial activity profile and maintained low toxicity profile. Unlike existing approaches, PepGlider provides precise control over continuous property distributions while maintaining generation quality, thus offering a generalizable solution for therapeutic and materials applications requiring exact property specifications.</p>

Yet, most machine learning approaches model these aspects in isolation: atom mapping, reaction center identification, and reaction classification are treated as separate problems. This separation limits accuracy, interpretability, and generalization. In this work, we argue that multitask learning provides a natural and powerful framework for reaction modeling. By jointly predicting mappings, centers, and classes within a single graph neural network, models can leverage structural dependencies between tasks. We proposed MARCC (Mapping-Assisted Reaction Center and Classification), a multitask architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the USPTO-50K benchmark. MARCC demonstrates that multitask supervision not only improves accuracy across all tasks but also provides a structured representation of reaction mechanisms.</p>

While single-model methods for scoring RNA structures can capture individual structural features, they fail to capture the broader structural consensus within a conformational ensemble, limiting their effectiveness in ranking and model selection. Results: We present PARSEbp, a fast and effective multi-model RNA scoring method that integrates pairwise structural agreement across the conformational ensemble with base pairing consistency. By leveraging both alignment-based global structural agreement at the 3D level and base pairing consistency at the 2D level, PARSEbp efficiently constructs a consensus similarity matrix from which per-structure accuracy scores are computed. Tested on 16th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP16) RNA targets, PARSEbp significantly outperforms existing single- and multi-model RNA scoring functions, including traditional statistical potentials, state-of-the-art deep learning methods, and consensus-based approaches, as well as a baseline variant of PARSEbp without the emphasis of base pairings, across a wide range of complementary assessment metrics.

Their translational utility, however, depends not only on predictive accuracy but also on reliability, the ability to provide consistent results across technical replicates and repeated biological measures. Here, we leveraged the TranslAGE platform to comprehensively evaluate the technical and biological reliability of 18 Epigenetic clocks, including chronological predictors, mortality predictors, pace-of-aging measures, reliable variants, and newer explainable clocks. Technical reliability was quantified across four independent datasets. For standard replicate assays on EPIC and 450K arrays, nearly all clocks achieved excellent technical reproducibility. However, some clocks showed dramatic drops in technical reliability based on differences in slide position and DNA extraction protocol. PC-based clocks, especially PCGrimAge and SystemsAge remained technically reliable in all cases. In contrast, biological reliability, measured across repeated samples collected within hours, before and after meals, under acute stress, across environmental exposures, and over days, was markedly lower, with most clocks showing only moderate stability. PCGrimAge was the only clock with good ICC > 0.75 for biological reliability. Importantly, technical reproducibility did not predict biological reliability; clocks that were technically robust often proved biologically unreliable. We further demonstrated that reliability directly constrains downstream applications. Clocks with higher ICCs produced more stable prognostic associations with cognitive decline and more consistent responsiveness to a vegan diet intervention, whereas unreliable clocks yielded highly variable or spurious effects. Together, these findings reveal that technical reliability is not enough: biological reliability remains a critical limitation for many DNA methylation clocks that constrains their utility, and our work provides a roadmap for prioritising next-generation clocks most suited for clinical translation.</p>

We analyze how Prochlorococcus genomics relate to high vs. low light environment adaptations, applying traditional comparative genomics and machine learning (ML) approaches to connect genotypes to phenotypes. We downloaded nearly 1,000 Prochlorococcus genomes from NCBI with information on their light adaptation ecotype (high-light/low-light) and depth of isolation using metadata through JGI. Average nucleotide identity analysis and traditional pangenome generation tools struggle to capture the cyanobacterial core genome, but despite its scant conservation, we clearly observe a sharp separation of the taxon by its light utilization preferences -- that is, its light ecotypes. A range of classical ML models trained to predict ecotype achieve exceptional binary classification accuracy even when predicting on partial genomes (Matthews Correlation Coefficient = 0.81 - 0.98), while regression models trained to predict the depth of isolation performed poorly, with relatively high root mean square error values (40.8 - 45.3m). For ecotype prediction, top features for the best-performing models included photosynthesis-associated genes and pathways, as well as some novel markers of unknown function. Our research findings recapitulate the extreme genetic versatility in Prochlorococcus and find that variable genetic markers allow excellent classification accuracy, and therefore, ecotype prediction, even for incomplete metagenomic assemblies, emphasizing the specialization and separation among these cyanobacterial ecotypes.</p>

The cytoplasmic variant, CyKILRb (exon 3 exclusion), promotes tumorigenesis, whereas the nuclear variant, CyKILRa (exon 3 inclusion), functions as a tumor suppressor. In this study, the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenic role of CyKILRb was characterized. Specifically, deep RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CyKILRb regulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to block downstream tumor suppressors. In particular, downregulation of CyKILRb induced the loss of PIK3R2, an activator of PI3K, as well as RPS6KB2 and GNB2, two implicated tumor promotors, with a concomitant increase in the tumor suppressors, CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN1B (p27). In contrast, CyKILRb ectopic expression produced the opposite effect, and suppression of either PIK3R2, PI3K or AKT attenuated CyKILRb-induced cell proliferation and clonogenic survival. CyKILRb negatively regulated CyKILRa expression, which was blocked by inhibition of either PI3K or AKT. PIK3R2 ectopic expression overcame the cellular effects of CyKILRb downregulation, but not PI3K or AKT inhibition orienting the signaling pathway from CyKILRb[->]{uparrow}PIK3R2[->]PI3K[->]AKT[->]{downarrow}CyKILRa[->]enhanced oncogenicity. These findings highlight the critical role of CyKILRb in tumorigenesis and define a novel feed-forward regulatory mechanism linked to alternative RNA splicing.</p>

Gastric cancer is especially concerning, with an estimated one million new cases and 800,000 deaths annually. Late diagnoses often lead to poor outcomes, requiring critical interventions such as radical surgical resection with clear margins, in conjunction with chemotherapy, or radiotherapy to prevent recurrences and enhance survival. Thus, EC represents a significant clinical challenge, especially given the difficulty in achieving precise surgical margins in aggressive subtypes like poorly cohesive carcinoma (PCC). Moreover, pathological intraoperative margin assessment encounters significant issues, especially for PCCs, due to lacks of sensitivity for microscopic infiltration, potentially leading to recurrence and poorer patient outcomes. We address these critical limitations by integrating SpiderMass, an ambient mass spectrometry (MS) technology, with clinical metadata and microbiome profiling couple along with Machine learning. We demonstrate SpiderMass capability in real-time molecular margin delineation and identify distinct lipidomic and microbiome signatures correlating with tissue type and prognosis. Our integrative approach provides a more precise and biologically informative intraoperative diagnostic tool, significantly enhancing surgical decision-makin, to improve patient outcomes and extend survival.</p>

To understand the strength and limitations of existing tools in various applications, here we use ten scHi-C datasets to benchmark thirteen embedding tools including Va3DE, a new convolutional neural network model that can accommodate large cell numbers. We built a software framework to decouple the preprocessing options of existing tools and found that no single tool works best across all datasets under default settings. The difficulty levels and preferred resolutions are different between benchmark datasets, and the choice of data representation and preprocessing strongly impact the embedding performance. Embedding cells from early embryonic stages relies on long-range compartment-scale contacts, but resolving cell cycle phases and complex tissue requires short-range loop-scale contacts. Both random-walk and inverse document frequency (IDF) transformation prefers long-range "compartment-scale" over short-range "loop-scale" embedding, while deep-learning methods better overcome sparsity at both scales and are more versatile with different resolutions. Finally, "diagonal integration" with independent data modal is a promising approach to distinguish similar cell subpopulations. Our findings underscore the significance of appropriate priors for scHi-C embedding and also offer insights into genome architecture heterogeneity.</p>

Deep learning approaches have recently shown promise to advance, automatize and accelerate analysis. However, most of the interest has been given to the segmentation of static objects of 2D/3D images whereas the segmentation of dynamic processes obtained from time-lapse acquisitions has been less explored. Here we adapted DeepFinder, a U-Net originally designed for 3D noisy cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data, for the detection of rare dynamic exocytosis events (termed ExoDeepFinder) observed in temporal series of 2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) images. ExoDeepFinder achieved good absolute performances with a relatively small training dataset of 12000 events in 60 cells. We rigorously compared deep learning performances with unsupervised conventional methods from the literature. ExoDeepFinder outcompeted the tested methods, but also exhibited a greater plasticity to the experimental conditions when tested under drug treatments and after changes in cell line or imaged reporter. This robustness to unseen experimental conditions did not require re-training demonstrating generalization capability of our deep learning model. ExoDeepFinder, as well as the annotated training datasets, were made transparent and available through an open-source software as well as a Napari plugin and can directly be applied to custom user data. The apparent plasticity and performances of ExoDeepFinder to detect dynamic events open new opportunities for future deep learning guided analysis of dynamic processes in live-cell imaging.</p>

Machine learning is a powerful tool for identifying predictive biomarkers and developing prognostic models. Here, we aim to integrate bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to construct a risk model to predict prognosis of GC patients. Transcriptome data and clinical information of GC patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Microarray data (GSE84437 and GSE26253) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic genes. The risk genes closely related to prognosis were screened by machine learning algorithms and the risk score was calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival curve, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to verify the validity of the risk model. The protein expression of hub genes in GC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. 7 hub genes (CGB5, FEM1A, MATN3, ZNF101, MARCKS, BRI3BP and APOD) were identified and correlated with GC prognosis. A high-precision risk model based on random survival forest (RSF) and generalized boosted regression modelling (GBM) was constructed using these 7 hub genes. The risk model has good predictive ability for GC patients' prognosis, and the risk score could be used as an independent prognostic factor for GC. In addition, the protein expression levels of CGB5, MATN3, MARCKS and APOD in GC tissues were significantly higher than those in normal tissues, and correlated with the pathological characteristics of GC patients. The risk model composed of 7 hub genes can accurately evaluate the prognosis of GC patients, which may contribute to the precise and personalized treatment of GC patients.</p>

In this study, we present a high-throughput strategy integrating amphiphile-dendrimer supramolecular probe (ADSP)-based sEV capture with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for sensitive, multiplexed detection of breast cancer (BC)-related surface proteins. Plasma-derived sEVs from BC patients at different clinical stages were analyzed, focusing on CD9, EpCAM, and HER2 as key proteins linked to vesicle identity and tumor progression. Gold nanoparticle-based SERS nanotags conjugated with specific antibodies enabled precise detection. Statistical and machine learning analyses of protein profiles allowed accurate discrimination among healthy donors, ductal carcinoma in situ (Stage 0), early stage BC (Stage I-II), and metastatic-stage BC (Stage IV). This integrated platform provides a powerful tool for BC diagnosis and highlights the potential of sEV-based liquid biopsy strategies for clinical application.</p>

The clinical motivation is sound and the reported discrimination and decision-curve metrics indicate promise. Yet the work illustrates two recurring challenges for clinical AI. First, models trained and tested within a single institution risk overestimation without external validation that reflects the intended deployment. Second, calibration and timing of prediction must be explicit to avoid information leakage and to ensure actionable probabilities. Attention to these methodological points will enhance interpretability and safe translation into peri-operative practice.</p>

The population for this study included 52,913 participants and 2911 plasma proteomics from UK Biobank. The cohort was divided into discovery and validation cohorts based on their countries. Cox regression, XGBoost, and SHAP analysis were used to identify key NSCLC-associated proteins. Machine learning (ML) models were developed and validated across different timeframes. Risk stratification was performed using protein levels. Temporal change analysis and two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) were conducted to assess the early prediction ability and causal relationships, respectively. Twenty-five proteins were significantly associated with NSCLC. ML identified CXCL17, CEACAM5, and WFDC2 as having the highest predictive power. The three-protein panel plus epidemiological indicators exhibited superior performance in 5- and 10-year predictions, achieving AUROC of 0.904 (95%CI: 0.839-0.968) and 0.873 (95%CI: 0.815-0.931), respectively. Risk stratification identified a high-risk group with a 9.18-fold higher risk than the general population and a 16.75-fold higher risk than the low-risk group, respectively. Temporal change analysis revealed that protein expression levels in cases were globally higher than in controls up to 10 years before diagnosis. MR implied a suggestive causal relationship between CXCL17 and NSCLC. Our findings suggest three plasma proteins possess robust predictive capabilities for NSCLC, allowing for predictions up to 10 years in advance. Incorporating these biomarkers into risk models enhances early detection, providing a foundation for targeted screening and precision medicine in NSCLC.</p>
