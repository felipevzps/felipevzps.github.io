First, experimental evidence is automatically leveraged to refine predictions, specifically, RNA-Seq coverage to inform gHMM gene prediction, and intron lengths to inform protein sequence alignments. Second, a consensus is created from an empirically optimized weighting of gene models from multiple sources. Third, Eukan runs a post-annotation routine to recover gene models missing from the consensus that otherwise have strong transcript support and appear to be protein-coding. We compare the results of Eukan with those of three popular freely-available pipelines (Maker, Braker, Gemoma) on 17 phylogenetically diverse haploid and diploid nuclear genomes. In addition to the commonly reported annotation accuracy statistics, we define a novel classification system of critical defects commonly observed in automated annotations. Furthermore, we developed a statistical model that demonstrates each of the tested pipelines correctly identified the majority of the validated "Gold Standard" gene models across the test set, but each pipeline uniquely generates a non-negligible portion of either fragmented, artificially fused, or missing gene models. Despite that, we demonstrate that Eukan performs consistently well where other pipelines encounter challenges, such as for compact protist genomes.</p>

Domain classifications such as the Evolutionary Classificatioxn of Protein Domains (ECOD) have incorporated these computational predictions alongside experimental structures to create comprehensive resources for the research community. The AlphaFold Database (AFDB) plays a unique role, providing millions of predicted structures that ECOD has systematically classified for human proteins, small pathogens, and reference proteomes. Here, we extend this classification framework to the Swiss-Prot/UniProtKB dataset, applying the Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models (DPAM) pipeline to classify domains from over 542,000 Swiss-Prot protein structure predictions, resulting in more than 1,032,000 classified domains. These domains span 3,493 ECOD topologies and display high assignment confidence (mean DPAM probability: 0.992), with extensive taxonomic and functional diversity. Notably, over 100,000 domains lack existing Pfam mappings, indicating novel evolutionary groups. These results significantly expand ECODs coverage into a functionally and taxonomically diverse protein space, anchoring high-confidence structure predictions in an evolutionary framework. By integrating Swiss-Prot predictions, we enhance the utility and interpretability of AlphaFold models and establish a foundation for future large-scale, functionally informed domain classifications.</p>

While intragenic insertion-free sequences have been considered as a reliable indicator for gene essentiality, so far, no exact probability distribution for these sequences has been proposed. Further, many methods require setting thresholds or parameter values a priori without providing any statistical basis, limiting the comparability of results. Here, we introduce Consecutive Non-Insertions Sites (ConNIS), a novel method for gene essentiality determination. ConNIS provides an analytic solution for the probability of observing insertion-free sequences within genes of given length and considers variation in insertion density across the genome. Based on an extensive simulation study and real world scenarios, ConNIS was found to be superior to prevalent state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with a low or medium insertion density. In addition, our results show that the precision of existing methods can be improved by incorporating a simple weighting factor for the genome-wide insertion density. To set methodically embedded parameter and threshold values of TraDIS methods a subsample based instability criterion was developed. Application of this criterion in real and synthetic data settings demonstrated its effectiveness in selecting well-suited parameter/threshold values across methods. A ready-to-use R package and an interactive web application are provided to facilitate application and reproducibility.</p>

While masked language modeling (MLM)-based approaches, such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer (NT), achieve strong performance, they are hindered by inefficiencies due to partial token supervision, pre-training/fine-tuning mismatches, and high computational costs. We introduce NucEL, the first ELECTRA-style pre-training framework for genomic foundation models, which overcomes these challenges. Through a discriminator network identifying tokens modified by a generator, NucEL achieves comprehensive token-level supervision across all sequence positions, thereby markedly improving training efficiency relative to the partial supervision of masked positions inherent in MLM frameworks. By integrating ModernBERT's architectural advancements, including hybrid local-global attention and flash attention mechanisms, NucEL establishes an optimized BERT architecture for genomic sequence modeling. Unlike traditional methods that tokenize genomic sequences into 6-mers, NucEL implements single-nucleotide tokenization, enabling fine-grained resolution and improving both efficiency and interpretability. Pre-trained on the human genome only, NucEL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets across diverse downstream tasks in both human and non-human species, including regulatory element identification (e.g., promoters, enhancers), transcription factor binding prediction in human and mouse, open chromatin region classification, and histone modification profiles, surpassing MLM-based models of similar size and rivaling models 25 times larger, such as NT. Ablation studies provide critical insights into tokenization and masking strategies, optimizing ELECTRA-style pretraining for DNA sequences. Attention analyses reveal NucEL's superior ability to capture biologically relevant sequence motifs compared to NT, offering valuable insights into its hierarchical learning process and regulatory element modeling capabilities. This work highlights the potential of ELECTRA-style pretraining as an efficient and effective strategy for advancing genomic representation learning with broad implications for future genomic research.</p>

The ability to monitor and adjust solute concentrations is essential for managing environmental stresses, particularly salt stress, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular ion sensing remain largely unknown. Here, we combine luminal pH measurements with mathematical modelling of ion transport to investigate the role of the Trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE) for cellular ion homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that cytosolic concentrations of Cl-, Na+ and K+ directly impact ion transport activity at the TGN/EE, thereby influencing luminal pH dynamics. Specifically, we find that the TGN/EE lumen becomes more alkaline when plants are exposed to elevated NaCl concentrations, indicating a previously unrecognised role for endomembrane pH regulation in salt stress responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TGN/EE ion transport mutants that fail to exhibit NaCl-induced alkalisation display hypersensitivity to Na+. These findings indicate that the translation of elevated cytosolic ion concentrations into TGN/EE luminal alkalisation, represents an important mechanism for conferring Na+ tolerance in plant cells.</p>
