                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: PubMed</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">The rapid increase in nucleotide sequence data generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies demands efficient computational tools for sequence comparison. Alignment-free (AF) methods offer a scalable alternative to traditional alignment-based approaches such as BLAST. This study evaluates alignment-free methods as scalable and rapid alternatives for viral sequence classification, focusing on identifying techniques that maintain high accuracy and efficiency when applied to extremely large datasets.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #000000; font-size: 22px;">Therapeutic target prediction for orphan diseases integrating genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies.</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: PubMed</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Therapeutic target identification is challenging in drug discovery, particularly for rare and orphan diseases. Here, we propose a disease signature, TRESOR, which characterizes the functional mechanisms of each disease through genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) data, and develop machine learning methods for predicting inhibitory and activatory therapeutic targets for various diseases from target perturbation signatures (i.e., gene knockdown and overexpression). TRESOR enables highly accurate identification of target candidate proteins that counteract disease-specific transcriptome patterns, and the Bayesian optimization with omics-based disease similarities achieves the performance enhancement for diseases with few or no known targets. We make comprehensive predictions for 284 diseases with 4345 inhibitory target candidates and 151 diseases with 4040 activatory target candidates, and elaborate the promising targets using several independent cohorts. The methods are expected to be useful for understanding disease-disease relationships and identifying therapeutic targets for rare and orphan diseases.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Proteins interact with a variety of molecules, including other proteins, DNAs, RNAs, ligands, ions, and lipids. These interactions play a crucial role in cellular communication, metabolic regulation, immune response, and structural integrity, making proteins fundamental to nearly all biological functions. Accurately predicting protein binding (interaction) sites is essential for understanding protein interactions and functions. Here, we introduce MPBind, a multitask protein binding site prediction method, which integrates protein language models (PLMs) that can extract structural and functional information from sequences and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) that can effectively capture geometric features of 3D protein structures. Through multitask learning, it can predict binding sites on proteins that interact with five key categories of binding partners: proteins, DNA/RNA, ligands, lipids, and ions, which is more comprehensive than most existing task-specific methods that can predict only one or a few kinds of binding sites. Moreover, MPBind outperforms both general bind site prediction methods and task-specific binding site prediction methods.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Molecular docking --- predicting the binding structure of a small molecule ligand to a protein --- is a crucial task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Traditional docking methods relying on scoring functions tend to be slow and inaccurate. Recent deep learning methods, especially diffusion-based generative models, have significantly improved the accuracy and computational efficiency of molecular docking. However, these methods still face challenges, particularly in the pocket-based docking setting, which involves docking a ligand when a protein pocket structure --- a cavity of the protein with potential ligand-binding capabilities --- is given. We introduce DTMol, a novel generative deep learning model designed to tackle the pocket-based molecular docking problem. Our model integrates a pretrained molecular representation framework with a new SE(3)-equivariant diffusion transformer architecture. The pretrained framework generates representations of both protein pockets and ligands, while the diffusion transformer effectively captures interaction information between them. Testing on the PDB-Bind dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms traditional docking methods and deep learning-based baselines. The efficacy of DTMol is further validated through a virtual screening task targeting Janus kinase 2 (PDB ID: 6BBV), followed by experimental validation of the top-ranked compounds via a protein kinase activity assay.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex disease with heritability of ~0.5, indicating genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to risk. Identifying gene expression networks contributing to risk using post-mortem human brain tissue has the limitation of conflating risk for AUD with consequences of alcohol use. We leveraged mice selectively bred for differential ethanol preference from a highly genetically diverse population to overcome this limitation. Ethanol intake was highly correlated with preference, high-preferring (HP) mice consumed more sweet- but not bitter-tasting solutions compared to low-preferring (LP) mice, and the lines did not differ in rate of ethanol elimination. Adult, ethanol-naive HP and LP mice contributed tissue from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a region critical to ethanol preference and intake. Single-nuclei and bulk RNA sequencing data were used to identify cell types and transcriptome changes related to selective breeding for differential risk for ethanol preference. Single nuclei analysis identified populations of inhibitory (~48% of cells) and excitatory (~23%) neurons, and non-neuronal (~29%) cells, but no differences in cell-type composition or gene expression were identified between the lines. Bulk CeA analysis identified differences between the lines for: (1) gene expression (2996 genes), (2) expression variability (426 genes), and (3) wiring (407 significant gene-gene correlations). Overall, lower variance was found in the HP line. Reduced gene-gene correlation, also found in HP mice, suggested that selection for high preference induced changes in transcriptional regulation resulting in reduced connectivity, specific to gene networks enriched in markers for inhibitory neurons expressing Isl1 and Tac1.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #000000; font-size: 22px;">A novel decoding strategy for ProteinMPNN to design with less MHC Class I immune-visibility</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Due to their versatility and diverse production methods, proteins have attracted a lot of interest for industrial as well as therapeutic applications. Designing new therapeutics requires careful consideration of immune responses, particularly the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) reaction to intra-cellular proteins. In this study, we introduce CAPE-Beam, a novel decoding strategy for the established ProteinMPNN protein design model. Our approach minimizes CTL immunogenicity risk by limiting designs to only consist of kmers that are either predicted not to be presented to CTLs or are subject to central tolerance. We compare CAPE-Beam to greedily sampling from ProteinMPNN and CAPE-MPNN. We find that our novel decoding strategy can produce structurally similar proteins while incorporating more human like kmers. This significantly lowers CTL immunogenicity risk in precision medicine, and represents a key step towards reducing this risk in protein therapeutics targeting a wider patient population.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Nucleic acid macromolecules can undergo significant structural changes--often mediated by nucleotide modification or molecular interactions. These alterations can be critical to their function. An ongoing challenge is to develop useful tools to quantify system-wide changes in nucleic acid-rich structures. We introduce StACKER, a robust Python package for observing conformational changes in a nucleic acid structure through its pi-stacking of base rings. StACKER creates System Stacking Fingerprints (SSFs) which highlight the landscape of pi- stacking throughout a molecule and can be used to show widespread conformational adjustments. Additionally, StACKER's Pairwise Stacking Fingerprint (PSF) can further characterize pi-stacking in a select residue pair, showing how the effects of localized residue changes spread through a nucleic acid system. We apply StACKER to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a subsystem of the ribosome to reveal that alternative codons at the ribosome A- site and 3' adjacent +1 codon position induce allosteric structure changes in the decoding center neighborhood, leading to a toggle between two conformational states. Through previous analysis of ribosome profiling data, we link these states to an observed fast/slow translation phenotype (Sun et al. 2024). We benchmark StACKER alongside other lenses for observing allostery to demonstrate its use in assessing allosteric shifts and its relevance to future structure-to-function studies.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Mice lacking Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a major protein of the lipid raft of plasma membrane, show dysregulated cellular proliferation of mammary gland and an abnormal fetoplacental communication during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to better understand the functional links of mammary gland metabolism with gene expression of the placenta and fetus. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to examine changes in mammary gland metabolism due to the absence of Cav1. Integrative metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses were applied to untangle functional links of metabolic pathways of the mammary gland with the gene expression changes of the placenta and fetus. The findings of this study show that metabolism and gene expression of the mammary gland are significantly impacted due to the loss of Cav1. Genes associated with specific metabolic and signaling pathways show coordinated expression changed in the placenta, mammary gland and fetal brain in Cav1-null mice. The cytokine signaling pathway emerges as a key player of the molecular crosstalk among the mammary gland, placenta and fetal brain. By interrogating the single-nuclei gene expression data of placenta and fetal brain previously generated from Cav1-null mice, the study further reveals that these metabolic and signaling genes are differentially regulated in specific cell types of the placenta and fetal brain. The findings of this study expand our understanding about the role of mammary gland metabolism in the regulation of fetoplacental communication in mammalian pregnancy.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">We developed Standardised Minimum 3D Distance (SM3DD), an entirely cell segmentation/annotation-free approach to the analysis of spatial RNA datasets, using it to compare lung tissue from 16 clinically normal individuals to those of 18 SARS-CoV-2 patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. RNA spatial coordinates were determined using the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (Bruker Spatial Biology, US). For each individual transcript location, we calculated the three-dimensional distances to the nearest transcript of each transcript type, standardising the distances to each transcript type. Mean SM3DDs were compared between normal and SARS-CoV-2 patients. Notably, hierarchical clustering of the directional log10(P) values organized genes by functionality, making it easier to interpret biological contexts and for FKBP11, where a decrease in distance to MZT2A was the most significant difference, suggesting a role in interferon signaling. Using a segmented principal components analysis of the entire SM3DD dataset, we identified multiple pathways, including 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', even though the assay did not include any SARS-CoV-2 transcripts.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #000000; font-size: 22px;">Assessing the relation between protein phosphorylation, AlphaFold3 models and conformational variability</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Proteins perform diverse functions critical to cellular processes. Transitions between functional states are often regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, which dynamically influence protein structure, function, folding, and interactions. Dysregulation of PTMs can therefore contribute to diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. However, the structure-function relationship between proteins and their modifications remains poorly understood due to a lack of experimental structural data, the inherent diversity of PTMs, and the dynamic nature of proteins. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly AlphaFold, have transformed protein structure prediction with near-experimental accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether these models can effectively capture PTM-driven conformational changes, such as those induced by phosphorylation. Here, we systematically evaluated AlphaFold models (AF2, AF3-non phospho, and AF3-phospho) to assess their ability to predict phosphorylation-induced structural diversity. By analysing experimentally derived conformational ensembles, we found that all models predominantly aligned with dominant structural states, often failing to capture phosphorylation-specific conformations. Despite its phosphorylation-aware design, AF3-phospho predictions provided only modest improvement over AF2 and AF3-non phospho predictions. Our findings highlight key challenges in modelling PTM-driven structural landscapes and underscore the need for more adaptable structure prediction frameworks capable of capturing modification-induced conformational variability.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Infectious diseases continue to be a leading cause of mortality and pose a significant global health threat. Thus the development of tools for surveillance and early detection of emerging pathogens is needed. In this study, we introduce PathogenFinder2, a novel predictor of bacterial pathogenic capacity in humans, available through an online server (http://genepi.food.dtu.dk/pathogenfinder2), or as a standalone program (https://github.com/genomicepidemiology/PathogenFinder2). The model, using protein language models for whole-genome phenotype prediction, surpasses the performance of previous methods, especially for novel bacterial taxa, while being taxonomy-agnostic and alignment-free. At the same time, it predicts the importance of each protein for the pathogenic capacity. This output might aid in characterizing potential pathogens, it readily identifies new candidates for virulence factors and vaccine targets and offers insights into infection metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we introduce the Bacterial Pathogenic Landscape, revealing distributions related to the host conditions, antagonist bacteria, infection site, or habitat.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Spatial transcriptomics (ST) captures gene expression with spatial context but lacks single-cell resolution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers high-resolution profiles without spatial information. Accurate spot-level decomposition requires effective integration of both. We present DTractor, a deep learning-based framework that improves cell-type deconvolution in ST data through spatial constraints and transfer learning. DTractor achieves dual utilization of scRNA-seq reference data by incorporating both a cell-type-specific gene expression matrix and learned latent embeddings into a unified matrix factorization model. This joint modeling enables accurate estimation of cell-type proportions and cell-type-resolved gene expression within each spatial spot, while preserving biological and spatial coherence. DTractor further applies spatial regularization to maintain local tissue structure. Across multiple ST platforms and tissue types, DTractor demonstrates improved decomposition accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to existing methods. The results from DTractor support downstream applications such as spatial domain analysis and the study of spatially organized cellular behaviors.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Source: bioRxiv</em></p>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Background</h4><p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">In the field plants continually experience changes in irradiance. Research in C3 species has revealed that whilst the Carbon-Benson cycle (CBC) adjusts rapidly to changing irradiance, there is substantial loss of photosynthesis efficiency due to slow adjustment of energy dissipation and stomatal conductance. Less is known about the impact of changing irradiance on photosynthetic efficiency in C4 species. We have subjected maize to a sudden increase or decrease of irradiance in the non-saturating range and performed time-resolved measurement of photosynthetic rate and profiling of metabolites from the CBC, the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), photorespiration and end-product biosynthesis. After a decrease in irradiance, photosynthesis is transiently buffered by energy delivered by transformations in the large pools of metabolites that are involved in intercellular shuttles. During the subsequent decline in photosynthesis, metabolism transitions to a sub-optimal state for photosynthesis in low irradiance, from which it takes several minutes to recover. One reason is that the large pools of metabolites that facilitate intercellular shuttles run down too far and it takes time to build them up again. After an increase in irradiance, there is a long delay until a new steady rate of photosynthesis is achieved. The delay is partly due to regulation of enzymes in the CBC and CCM, but also to the need to build up large pools of metabolites to drive intercellular shuttles. In addition, in both transitions, transient imbalances between the pumping and utilization of CO2 lead to increased back-leakage of CO2 or to photorespiration, further decreasing photosynthetic efficiency.</p>
