                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Genomic Language Models (GLMs) suffer from the inherent problem of data scarcity, due to the cost, time and complexity of wet-lab experiments. Data augmentation offers a solution; however traditional methods may unintentionally affect the underlying structure or function. By combining evolutionary signals with the RNA secondary structure, augmentations can retain original function, and remain structurally coherent. To implement this, we developed PhyloAug, a structure-aware, evolution-inspired augmentation method grounded in neutral theory. We employ Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) to accurately perturb RNA sequences, and utilise phylogenetic analysis via PAML to provide site-wise restrictions based on evolutionary principles. These principles are obtained through the identification of evolutionarily neutral sites (sequence positions where mutations are unlikely to alter function), which are concatenated with the predicted (or known) secondary structure. We thereby ensure adherence to the underlying structure whilst enabling biologically plausible variation. To validate the biological validity of our augmentations, we compare our predicted neutral sites with Rfam-annotated conserved regions and assess sequence similarity to the underlying multiple sequence alignments. We next fine-tune GLMs on augmented data, yielding significant performance improvements up to 12.9% MCC, and 17.2% F1-Score.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as an exemplary technology in biology and clinical applications, offering a crucial complement to other transcriptomic profiling protocols due to its high sensitivity, precision, and accuracy in characterizing transcriptomes. However, the rapid proliferation of RNA-seq tools necessitates the adoption of robust software development practices. Such development underscores the critical need to examine how RNA-seq tools are developed, maintained, and distributed; and whether the data they generate is reproducible as all of these factors are essential for ensuring software reliability, transparency, and trust in scientific findings. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of 434 RNA-seq tools developed between 2008 and 2024, categorizing them based on the type of analysis they perform. Our evaluation encompassed their software development and distribution methodologies, as well as the attributes contributing to their widespread adoption and dependability within the biomedical community, which were quantified by factors such as package manager availability, containerization, multithreading support, documentation quality, and inclusion of example datasets. Our findings establish the first documented positive association between rigorous software development practices and their adoption of published RNA-seq tools as measured by citations (Mann-Whitney U test, p-value = 4.9e-26). By identifying key characteristics of widely adopted software, our findings guide developing robust and user-friendly RNA-seq tools, thereby reinforcing the call for rigorous community-wide standards.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">Background: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 9.7 million deaths in 2022. Faced with this significant public health challenge, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as promising alternatives that may minimize the side effects associated with conventional treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To support mAb research and development, IMGT(R), the international ImMunoGeneTics information system, has established two standardized data sources namely IMGT/mAb-DB, a comprehensive database for mAbs, and, more recently, IMGT/mAb-KG, a dedicated knowledge graph for mAbs. Despite these advances, the development of therapeutic mAbs remains both time-consuming and financially burdensome--costs can reach up to $2.8 billion. To address this challenge and accelerate cancer treatment, mAb repurposing represents a promising alternative. Results: In this study, we leveraged a subset of IMGT/mAb-KG, dedicated to the oncology domain, to develop a scientific hypothesis generation application for mAb repurposing. This application, based on knowledge graph embedding techniques, is designed to suggest potential mAb candidates for novel oncology applications. A user-friendly web interface provides access to the tool, incorporating visual support to facilitate the interpretation of generated hypotheses. This application is a decision support tool aiming to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic applications for existing mAbs. Conclusion: Our application demonstrates the potential of knowledge graph embedding techniques in the oncology domain by enabling the repurposing of existing mAbs for new therapeutic uses. Using this tool, we have identified two novel mAbs, loncastuximab tesirine and glofitamab, both currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This decision-support tool thus facilitates the discovery of new therapeutic opportunities by effectively repositioning existing mAbs for oncological indications, potentially accelerating the development of cancer therapies and addressing critical public health needs.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by impaired behaviour and language. It affects individuals between 45 and 65 years of age. The present study aims to identify potential phytochemicals against target receptor of FTD. Transcriptome data analysis guided computer-aided drug design (CADD) was conducted to investigate molecular interactions between active phytochemicals present in Indian spices and differentially expressed genes. In present study, samples for patients with FTD were obtained from GEO dataset [GSE92340]. The samples were pre-processed followed by differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2. The patient sample was analyzed for 1882 upregulated genes. Hub gene out of DEGs was identified using CytoHubba Plugin of Cytoscape based on eleven parameters (Degree, Edge Percolated Component (EPC), Maximum Neighbourhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighbourhood Component (DMNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), Bottleneck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress). HDAC1 gene was identified as hub gene and key target in case of FTD. CADD pipeline was used to identify phytochemicals against HDAC1 gene. A list of eighty-one phytochemicals found in Indian spices was analyzed for their drug likeness abilities using molinspiration and toxicity prediction using ProTox-II, which identified twenty-three phytochemicals as safe drug-like compounds. PatchDock was employed to examine interactions between phytochemical compounds and HDAC1. Molecular interactions revealed rosmarinic acid derived from rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) as the most effective drug for FTD having lowest ACE value of -395 kcal/mol. In conclusion, this study demonstrates essential role of HDAC1 in pathogenesis of FTD and demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of rosmarinic acid against FTD.</p>

While traditional pest management strategies exist, genetic resistance offers a more sustainable long-term solution. This study aimed to identify genomic loci associated with banana weevil resistance in Rwandan Musa cultivars through genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. We conducted a comprehensive GWAS using 485 Musa accessions from Rwanda's national banana germplasm collection. Phenotypic evaluation involved controlled weevil infestation trials across three locations (Rubona, Karama, and Rwerere) over two seasons (2022-2023). Genotyping was performed using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), yielding 45,678 high-quality SNPs. Population structure, linkage disequilibrium, and association mapping were analyzed using TASSEL 5.0 and GAPIT3. Significant phenotypic variation was observed among cultivars (H2 = 0.74, p < 0.001). GWAS identified 23 significant SNPs (p < 2.19 x 10-6) associated with weevil resistance across chromosomes 2, 5, 8, and 11. The strongest association was found on chromosome 8 (SNP8_2347891, p = 4.32 x 10-9, R2 = 12.4%). Candidate genes within resistance loci included leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases, chitinases, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzymes. Local Rwandan cultivars 'Injagi', 'Igikashi', and 'Intokatoke' demonstrated exceptional resistance levels (damage index < 2.0). This study provides the first comprehensive genetic analysis of banana weevil resistance in Rwandan germplasm, identifying novel resistance loci and candidate genes. These findings offer valuable resources for marker-assisted selection and breeding programs to develop weevil-resistant banana varieties adapted to Rwandan conditions.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Viral species classification is crucial for understanding viral evolution, epidemiology, and developing effective diagnostics and treatments. Traditional methods often rely on sequence similarity, which can be challenging for rapidly evolving viruses. Pangenomes, offering a comprehensive representation of species genomic diversity, provide a richer perspective, but their analysis often requires advanced computational methods. We investigate the use of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA), an emerging computing paradigm that relies on vectors in high-dimensional spaces to encode a multi-species viral pangenome. We develop a new method for encoding graph-structured viral pangenomes using high-dimensional vectors. Pangenomes are represented as weighted de Bruijn graphs constructed using sequences of consecutive k-mers from the genomes, while information about the genome species (their class) is encoded as specific weights on the edges of the graph. The weighted de Bruijn graph representation is encoded into a single high-dimensional vector. We tested three classification strategies: a flat model at the species level, a flat model at the genus level, and a two-step hierarchical model. We applied our method to a pangenome comprising 542 viral species from NCBI GenBank. Our results reveal a complex relationship between model architecture and classification accuracy. The flat species-level model achieved the highest accuracy, correctly classifying 87.08% of test genomes. Counter-intuitively, simplifying the problem to the genus level or using a hierarchical approach degraded performance, with accuracies dropping to 60.51% and 33.57% respectively. These outcomes highlight critical challenges in alignment-free classification, such as signal dilution in overly broad taxonomic groups and error propagation in multi-step models. The model reconstruction rate proved to be a reliable measure of confidence, rather than a direct predictor of correctness. This novel approach offers a promising new direction for viral classification, not only for its predictive power but its ability to reveal underlying challenges in genomic taxonomy.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide a quantitative measure of genetic predisposition to complex traits and diseases, and their predictive capacity has expanded significantly with the growth of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Longitudinal population cohorts that integrate genomic, clinical, and lifestyle information offer a valuable setting for studying PRS-trait relationships across diverse phenotypic domains. However, accessible tools for systematic and interactive exploration of these associations remain scarce. Here, we present PolyGenie, a web-based platform designed for phenome-wide exploration of PRS associations with clinical diagnoses, metabolomic traits, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures. The current implementation includes precomputed PRS for over 100 traits applied to 5,000 genotyped individuals from the GCAT cohort. Users can navigate interactive visualizations, including PheWAS-style association plots and disease prevalence trends across PRS percentiles, facilitating the interpretation of pleiotropic effects and population-level risk stratification. PolyGenie is freely accessible at https://polygenie.igtp.cat and aims to support hypothesis generation, biomarker discovery, and translational research in complex disease genetics.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) enable diversification of protein functions, but the efficiency of genetic code expansion (GCE) in eukaryotes is hindered by competition between suppressor tRNAs and release factors. Prior work has identified eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) mutants that improve ncAA incorporation, suggesting that screens for improved variants may lead to further enhancements. Here, we developed a high-throughput system to screen eRF1 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where eRF1 mutants are coexpressed on a plasmid alongside genomically encoded, wild-type eRF1. This strategy enabled recovery of live cells expressing eRF1 variants that enhance ncAA incorporation, even with mutants known to severely affect cell viability in the absence of WT eRF1 expression. We prepared and screened a million-member library of randomly mutated eRF1 variants for clones exhibiting improved ncAA integration phenotypes. Deep sequencing revealed a diverse set of enriched mutations across all three major domains of eRF1. Interestingly, several enriched mutations identified here are also found in naturally occurring eRF1 homologs from species that recode canonical stop codons. When eRF1 variants were combined with yeast knockout strains also known to enhance ncAA incorporation, this resulted in further improvements to efficiency, highlighting the complementarity of release factor engineering to other GCE enhancement strategies. This work demonstrates that high-throughput engineering of the eukaryotic translational apparatus is a powerful approach to identify previously unknown solutions for enhancing ncAA incorporation, with implications for elucidating and precisely manipulating the molecular functions of essential translational machinery.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Characterization of cell-free expression (CFE) systems must expand beyond single spectrophotometric measurements of a green fluorescent protein to provide meaningful metrics of system performance during a CFE reaction and enable the development of predictable and reproducible CFE technologies. To date, comprehensive characterization of these systems has posed a formidable measurement challenge, as it requires time-course measurements of reactions involving endogenous components in addition to transcription and translation of a target genetic circuit added exogenously to the CFE reaction. To provide more informative characterization that is still easy to conduct and complements current practices, we demonstrate a measurement framework for transcription and translation dynamics. We use different nucleic acid templates to characterize a suite of Escherichia coli extracts prepared in house, as well as extracts and reconstituted systems available commercially. Notably, we include measurements of low-performing systems to assess the sensitivity of our measurement framework and elucidate metrics indicative of system performance. For all these CFE systems, we compute reaction metrics to enable quantitative comparison. We believe this is an accessible measurement framework that can complement existing characterization, provide informative data for developing CFE technologies, and be adopted for routine characterization.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Cognition is often associated with complex brains, yet many forms of learning--such as habituation, sensitization, and even spacing effects--have been observed in single cells and aneural organisms. These simple cognitive abilities, despite their cost, offer evolutionary advantages by allowing organisms to reduce environmental uncertainty and improve survival. Recent studies have confirmed early claims of learning-like behavior in protists and slime molds, pointing to the presence of basal cognitive functions long before the emergence of nervous systems. In this work, we adopt a synthetic biology approach to explore how minimal genetic circuits can implement non-associative learning in unicellular and multicellular systems. Building on theoretical models and using well-characterized regulatory elements, we design and simulate synthetic circuits capable of reproducing habituation, sensitization, and the massed-spaced learning effect. Our designs incorporate activators, repressors, fluorescent reporters, and quorum-sensing molecules, offering a platform for experimental validation. By examining the structural and dynamical constraints of these circuits, we highlight the distinct temporal dynamics of gene-based learning systems compared to neural counterparts and provide insights into the evolutionary and engineering challenges of building synthetic cognitive behavior at the cellular level.</p>

Currently, there is no established standard-of-care treatment for this subtype, and chemotherapy response rates are only ~4%. One defining characteristic of LGSOC is a high prevalence of mutations within the MAPK pathway, which has motivated studies using MEK inhibitors to treat this disease. A recent phase II/III clinical trial using trametinib to treat patients with recurrent LGSOC improved the response rate to 26%; however, all patients eventually progressed due to the emergence of therapeutic resistance. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating combined inhibition of MEK and FAK with avutometinib plus defactinib for LGSOC patients, with preliminary results demonstrating response rates near 50%. While these results are highly encouraging, a significant subset of patients still fails to respond to existing targeted treatments. Additionally, development of therapeutic resistance in initial responders remains a major obstacle. Here, we sought to characterize molecular responses of LGSOC to MEK inhibition, both acutely and during the development of spontaneous drug resistance, with a goal of identifying adaptive mechanisms LGSOC cells utilize to withstand MAPK inhibition. Our research identified significant upregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in response to MEK inhibition. While targeted inhibition of AKT had minimal impact on its own, combination with MEK inhibitors produced strong synergistic suppression of proliferation in LGSOC cells. This combination strategy could potentially be used to prevent or reverse the emergence of MEK inhibitor resistance in LGSOC patients.</p>

Methods: We varied inter-pulse spacing to modulate the mean dose rate (MDR) of our unique 35 MeV electron beam, while maintaining extremely high instantaneous dose rate (IDR), and used film dosimetry to characterize dosimetry and targeting accuracy. We combined this HIGS-FLASH beam with an organotypic rat brain slice/breast carcinoma co-culture model of brain metastasis to assess effects on normal and neoplastic tissues. Live cell and bioluminescence imaging demonstrated cancer cell growth effects, while normal tissue responses and immune activation were assessed with live cell imaging, cytokine profiles, and confocal microscopy. We performed comparison experiments with 20 MeV electrons from a Varian clinical linear accelerator (VCLA) operating at conventional dose rate. Results: The highest IDR of the HIGS-FLASH beam to-date was 20.7 +/- 0.6 MGy/s, with maximum MDR of 20.7 MGy/s (1 microsecond pulse of 20.7 Gy). Beam targeting was accurate to < 1 mm and reproducible. HIGS-FLASH and VCLA dose rates equivalently decreased cancer cell growth. HIGS-FLASH irradiation significantly increased TNF-alpha and fractalkine levels and confocal microscopy revealed distinct changes in microglial morphology in normal brain slices, suggesting microglia activation following HIGS-FLASH irradiation. Conclusions: Our novel experimental platform produces extremely high dose rates and rapid normal/neoplastic tissue readouts for mechanistic research into the effects of FLASH radiation on the brain. HIGS-FLASH irradiation induces comparable cancer cell growth inhibition but differential effects on cytokines and microglial morphology, suggesting that acute innate immune responses may be involved in FLASH normal tissue effects in the brain.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Autophagy inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for the management of various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We previously reported SBP-7455, a dual inhibitor of unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and its homologue ULK2, and described its effects on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of SBP-5147 and SBP-7501, two new dual ULK1/2 inhibitors that are cytotoxic against NSCLC cells, inhibit autophagic flux in A549 cells, and present greater oral exposure than SBP-7455 at a lower dose. In addition, SBP 5147 effectively modulates autophagy and increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I in NSCLC cells, which may support the rationale for ULK1/2 inhibition as a strategy to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. Together these data support the use of ULK inhibitors as part of a cancer treatment strategy, both as a single agent as well as in combination with current therapies.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Cutaneous melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer in which tumor cell plasticity drives transitions between proliferative and invasive states. The glycolytic regulator PFKFB4 has been implicated in cancer cell motility, but its role in melanoma progression in vivo remains unclear. Using zebrafish larval xenografts, we found that PFKFB4 depletion reduced invasion in MeWo cells without affecting tumor growth, whereas in A375P cells it decreased tumor growth but had no effect on invasion or metastasis. In MeWo, PFKFB4 loss was associated with reduced SNAIL2 expression, while no effect on EMT transcription factors was observed in A375P cells. Rescue experiments indicated that PFKFB4 and SNAIL2 acted independently in regulating Mewo migration in vitro. These findings identify PFKFB4 as a context-dependent regulator of melanoma progression.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Abstract:</span> Keloid scarring and Metabolic Syndrome (MS) are distinct conditions marked by chronic inflammation and tissue dysregulation, suggesting shared pathogenic mechanisms. Identifying common regulatory genes could unveil novel therapeutic targets. Methods. We performed an integrative analysis of public microarray datasets from keloid, MS, and respective healthy control tissues. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify shared gene modules. A diagnostic gene signature was developed using LASSO regression and machine learning, and validated on independent datasets. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to localize gene expression to specific cell types. The function of a top candidate gene, FERMT3, was investigated via in vitro experiments in macrophages and fibroblasts. Results. We identified 2,788 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in keloids and 2,639 in MS compared to healthy controls, with 146 genes overlapping. WGCNA identified a key co-expression module (termed the "salmon" module) significantly associated with both conditions and enriched in metabolic and immune pathways. A 23-gene signature demonstrated fair to good predictive performance for both keloids (validation AUC = 0.783) and MS (AUC = 0.905). scRNA-seq analysis revealed that FERMT3 was highly expressed in macrophages and fibroblasts in keloid tissue. In vitro, modulation of FERMT3 in these cell types significantly altered their metabolic profiles (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation), inflammatory cytokine production, proliferation, and migration. Conclusions. Our integrative analysis identifies a shared transcriptomic signature between keloids and MS and highlights FERMT3 as a key potential regulator of the metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes in these conditions. These findings suggest that FERMT3 could be a promising therapeutic target for diseases driven by fibro-metabolic dysregulation.</p>
