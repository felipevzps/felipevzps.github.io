<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering a Covalent Linkage into a Dimeric De Novo Enzyme Reveals a Novel Life-Sustaining Mechanism</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liao, G., Tao, S., +4 authors, Hecht, M. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designing novel proteins that share no homology with natural sequences, but which nonetheless provide life sustaining functions, is an important goal for synthetic biology. Towards this goal, we previously reported Syn-F4, the first de novo enzyme capable of catalyzing a life-sustaining reaction, both in vitro and in vivo. Syn-F4 catalyzes hydrolysis of the siderophore, ferric enterobactin, thereby releasing iron and enabling growth in iron-limited media of an otherwise inviable {Delta}fes strain of Escherichia coli. Although Syn-F4 provides a direct enzymatic replacement of the natural ferric enterobactin esterase encoded by Fes, it has a dramatically different structure and enzymatic mechanism than the natural Fes enzyme. The novel Syn-F4 enzyme forms a 4-helix bundle, comprising a homodimer of two -helical hairpins. Here we describe the engineering of a covalent peptide linkage into the homodimer to generate a single chain 4-helix bundle. As expected, the resulting linked protein (Syn-F4-Link) also rescued {Delta}fes cells in iron-limited media. Moreover, X-ray crystallography revealed a 3D structure similar to the parental homodimer. Surprisingly, however, the linked protein was not enzymatically active. Instead, Syn-F4-Link rescues {Delta}fes cells by upregulating biosynthesis of the enterobactin siderophore thereby enabling assimilation of sufficient iron to sustain cell growth. These findings demonstrate that two very similar de novo proteins can sustain cell growth using dramatically different biological mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unimeth: A unified transformer framework for accurate DNA methylation detection from nanopore reads</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, S., Xiao, Y., +5 authors, Ni, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a powerful technology for DNA methylation detection, particularly in repetitive genomic regions and at the haplotype scale. However, existing computational methods show inconsistent accuracy across sequence contexts, species, and sequencing chemistries. Here, we present Unimeth, a unified transformer-based framework that simultaneously predicts multi-site methylation from nanopore reads. Unimeth employs a patch-based architecture and a three-phase training strategy, including pre-training, read-level fine-tuning, and site-level calibration, to fully leverage genome-wide methylation information. In comprehensive benchmarks involving 20 samples spanning 13 species, Unimeth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This unified approach demonstrates superior accuracy and significantly reduced false positives across a wide range of scenarios, including the detection of both 5mC and 6mA, application in organisms from mammals and plants to bacteria, analysis of both wild-type and mutant samples, and use of both R10.4 and R9.4 pore chemistries. Furthermore, Unimeth is demonstrated to be a highly accurate tool for methylation analysis in transposons and centromeric regions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploration of RNA outside segmented cells in spatial transcriptomics reveals extrasomatic RNA organization</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Marco Salas, S., Dammann, M., +4 authors, Theis, F. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Image-based spatial transcriptomics (iST) enables visualization of RNA molecules in their spatial context, yet up to 40% of transcripts remains unassigned to cells and has been largely overlooked. In this study, we systematically analyze unassigned RNAs (uRNAs) across 14 public iST datasets and multiple technologies to characterize their nature and relevance in tissue biology. By assessing potential technical origins, in particular segmentation errors, noise, and diffusion across many tissues in both humans and mice, we find that around one third of uRNAs cannot be attributed to technical artifacts. Those non-technical uRNAs are enriched around cells with complex morphologies such as neurons, glia, and endothelial cells and reflect transcripts localized in cellular protrusions and extrasomatic compartments. Using these signals, we infer protrusion-associated transcript localization and identify cell-cell contacts beyond standard cell-centric segmentation. Our results challenge the assumption that uRNA is purely technical noise and instead highlight its potential biological relevance, particularly in relation to intracellular RNA localization and tissue architecture. To enable their systematic study, we introduce troutpy, a Python package for quantitative uRNA exploration in spatial transcriptomics data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Subtype-Specific Dependencies and Drug Vulnerabilities Enable Precision Therapeutics in Head and Neck Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vaz, J. M., Zhu, S., +8 authors, Gujral, T. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is well recognized, yet existing subtype frameworks remain largely descriptive and have not translated into therapeutic decision-making. Here, we establish a mechanistic platform that converts transcriptomic diversity into drug-actionable tumor states. Integrating multi-cohort RNA-seq from 727 tumors across five independent datasets, genome-scale CRISPR dependency maps, and pharmacologic screening, we define distinct tumor survival circuits across HPV-negative HNSCC and nominate subtype-matched therapeutic strategies. These circuits encompass a proliferative axis (MYC, MET/FAK, inflammatory and translational programs), an epithelial-differentiated/adhesion program, an EMT-like state with stromal activation, and mitochondrial/oxidative metabolic states, each mapping to selective liabilities (e.g., mitotic/autophagy control, ERBB/PI3K and cadherin signaling, OXPHOS/mitochondrial translation, and G2/M-integrin-Notch pathways, respectively). We then develop a transcriptomic predictor of EGFR-inhibitor response using machine learning and validate it in prospectively collected, fresh patient-derived 3D microtumors. The resulting 13-gene signature identifies erlotinib-responsive tumors (R = 0.93) and maps biologically to an epithelial-differentiated state, outperforming EGFR expression alone. Our study establishes a subtype-to-dependency-to-therapy framework, enabling precision stratification and providing a clinically feasible path for prospective biomarker deployment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spotsweeper-py: spatially-aware quality control metrics for spatial omics data in the Python ecosystem</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, X., Totty, M. S., Hicks, S. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) generates large and heterogeneous datasets where global (tissue-wide) quality control (QC) metrics often over-aggressively remove biologically meaningful regions or miss localized artifacts. Recently, spatially-aware QC metrics have been introduced in SpotSweeper, but this is limited to the R programming language, which makes it challenging to use these metrics within the Python/scverse ecosystem. Here, we present SpotSweeper-py, a Python equivalent package of SpotSweeper that computes neighborhood-aware z-scores for standard QC metrics such as total counts, log total counts, number of detected genes, and percentage of mitochondrial counts. We demonstrate the performance and usability of SpotSweeper-py on two public datasets from the 10x Genomics Visium and VisiumHD platforms. This implementation of local spatially-aware QC metrics enables direct integration with Python/scverse ecosystem, reduces false positives from global quality control while preserving tissue-specific architecture. Plotting utilities are also included for quick visualizations of flagged outliers. By making robust local QC accessible in Python, SpotSweeper-py strengthens the reliability of pipelines for analyzing SRT data. The open-source software is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/spotsweeper).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Triad: Models, Importances, and Significance at Scale</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">FIEVET, G., Broseus, J., +1 author, Hergalant, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for comparing various combinations of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the context of explainable AI (XAI) for variable selection in experimental biological and biomedical data. Our goal was to assess the efficiency, computational cost, and accuracy of different method combinations across six simulated scenarios, each replicated ten times. These scenarios encompass various classification and regression complexities, including variance differences, bimodal distributions, eXclusive-OR (XOR) interactions, concentric circles, and nonlinear relationships such as parabolic and sinusoidal functions. We tested several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). We combined these models with diverse feature-importance methods such as Gini importance, accuracy decrease, SHAP values (Shapley Additive exPlanations), and Olden's method. We further applied significance-thresholding approaches, namely PIMP (Permutation IMPortance), mProbes, and the novel simThresh developed for this study. Additionally, we explored different dataset sizes to evaluate the scalability of these methods. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in computational demands, ranging from very rapid evaluations (e.g., DT combined with Gini importance and simThresh averaging 0.15 seconds) to extensive computations (e.g., MLP combined with SHAP and PIMP exceeding 7 hours). Among the tested combinations, RF/Accuracy/PIMP achieved the best overall performance, successfully identifying 59 out of 60 replicates in our benchmark study. However, this approach raises concerns regarding its scalability when applied to large-scale omics datasets in real-world settings due to its computational demands. In contrast, Decision Tree or Random Forest models using Gini and simThresh criteria ranked second, with 50 out of 60 detections. While less accurate, these methods require fewer computational resources, making them more promising candidates for scalable applications in omics data analysis. The proposed evaluation framework thus serves as a valuable tool for method selection, particularly relevant when dealing with large-scale omics datasets where computational resources and accuracy are both critical considerations.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">scProtoTransformer: Scalable Reference Mapping Across Molecules, Cells and Donors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tang, Z., He, H., +7 authors, Chen, C. Y.-C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid accumulation of single-cell data has made it possible to comprehensively characterize biological systems at molecular, cellular, and donor levels. However, scalable reference mapping across different resolutions remains a major challenge in current research. Here, we propose scProtoTransformer, a prototype-based Transformer architecture designed to achieve scalable reference mapping across molecular, cell, and donor levels. scProtoTransformer introduces a knowledge-guided prototype tokenizer that projects gene expression into biologically interpretable pathway prototypes, effectively reducing numerical batch effects while preserving biological semantic patterns. Furthermore, by leveraging knowledge distilled from the foundation model and a dynamic supervised fine-tuning strategy, scProtoTransformer achieves robust biological representations with reduced pre-training requirements. Benchmark experiments across molecular, cell, and donor-level reference mapping demonstrate that scProtoTransformer delivers competitive or even superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, while providing interpretability through biologically prototypes. Together, these results establish scProtoTransformer as a unified framework for scalable reference mapping, laying the foundation for systematic understanding from genes to individuals.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RAmpSim: A Thermodynamic Simulator for Hybridization Capturein Metagenomic Sequencing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, A., Boucher, C., +1 author, Yu, Y. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hybridization (bait) capture combined with long-read sequencing enables targeted profiling within complex metagenomes but introduces systematic biases from bait multiplicity, sequence composition, and species abundance that existing simulators ignore. We present RAmpSim, a fast simulator that models bait-target hybridization and fragment capture using a thermodynamic nearest-neighbor energy model and Boltzmann-weighted sampling of binding sites. Fragments are generated through multinomial sampling parameterized by bait concentration, binding energy, and genomic abundance before being passed to existing long-read simulators for modeling platform-specific errors. Implemented in Rust, RAmpSim reproduces empirical within-genome coverage and cross-species enrichment patterns observed in capture-based metagenomic datasets. Compared to uniform-coverage baselines,RAmpSim's simulated coverage distributions are up to an order of magnitude closer to real data with respect to earth mover's distance. Classification analysis reveals high recall in classifying high coverage regions between simulated and experimental distributions while outperforming a uniform baseline. Supporting accurate benchmarking and bait-set evaluation, RAmpSim provides an interpretable, efficient framework for simulating capture-based metagenomic sequencing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SAMPLE-BASED TRAINING DATA FOR EFFECTIVE 3D CELL SEGMENTATION</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Smith, A., Bretschneider, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning remains the leading choice for cell segmentation, a critical step in bioimaging analysis. Whilst deep learning models provide excellent segmentation accuracy, a large number of hand-annotated samples are required which are scarce in 3D. We propose a method for generating synthetic data for training deep learning models to augment or replace such datasets. By preserving key features in real data, we show that a standard UNet trained on synthetic data can segment single motile cells with branching filopodia with high accuracy. We also demonstrate how low-effort slice annotations can sufficiently replace volume annotations in our data generation pipeline. Overall, we provide a simple alternative to annotating large 3D datasets for training neural networks to segment cell imaging data.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">de la Calle Arregui, C., Frank, A. R., +6 authors, McFadden, D. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oncocytic (Hurthle cell) carcinoma of the thyroid (OCT) is characterized by widespread loss of heterozygosity (LOH), mitochondrial accumulation and recurrent mitochondrial DNA mutations leading to impairment of complex I. Here, we establish and characterize a novel OCT cell line, UT946, which displays severe mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction and a Warburg metabolic phenotype. Using a series of cytoplasmic hybrids, we establish that the complex I defect in UT946 stems from a nuclear-encoded loss of function mutation in the complex I subunit NDUFS1. To our surprise, the mutation in NDUFS1 was inherited as a recessive germline allele that underwent LOH in the tumor to expose functional loss of complex I. A re-analysis of 91 OCT tumor genomes revealed that LOH-driven exposure of recessive germline mutations in complex I subunits was a recurrent mechanism underlying complex I inactivation in OCT. These findings unveil a new germline-driven mechanism of complex I loss and metabolic reprogramming in cancer, and provide further evidence of the strong selective pressure for complex I impairment in OCT.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TMEM Doorway Mediated Metastasis in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by Tie2 Signaling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pereira Zambalde, E., Ariyan, L. A., +15 authors, McAuliffe, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost invariably fatal due to early hematogenous dissemination that occurs before the primary tumor is clinically detectable, yet the cellular mechanism of tumor cell intravasation has remained unknown. Using multiphoton intravital imaging in autochthonous and orthotopic PDAC models, we demonstrate that intravasation occurs at Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways tri-cellular structures comprising a MENA-expressing tumor cell, a Tie2+; macrophage, and an endothelial cell in direct contact. These structures are abundant in human PDAC, enriched for Tie2+; macrophages, and markedly reduced after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Selective pharmacologic inhibition of Tie2 with rebastinib decreases TMEM-associated transient vascular openings, suppresses circulating and hepatic disseminated tumor cells, and when combined with perioperative FOLFIRINOX after curative-intent resection improves median survival in murine PDAC. These findings establish TMEM doorways as a common, druggable mechanism of intravasation across epithelial cancers and identify Tie2+; macrophages as a therapeutic target to prevent metastatic seeding in PDAC, a disease with no anti-metastatic therapies. TMEM doorway-mediated intravasation in PDAC supports its role as a common gateway for hematogenous metastasis in carcinoma.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inhibition of METTL3 by STC-15 induces RNA misprocessing that results in dsRNA formation and activates innate immunity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fischl, H., Samuels, T. J., +6 authors, Rausch, O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The RNA methyltransferase METTL3 is responsible for the generation of m6A, the most abundant modification mark on mRNA and long non-coding RNA. Accumulating evidence suggests numerous roles of METTL3 in cancer initiation and progression and highlights the potential for targeting this enzyme in oncology. STC-15 is a potent and selective METTL3 inhibitor and the first RNA modifying enzyme inhibitor to enter human clinical development. It is structurally related to the previously published tool inhibitors STM2457 and STM3675. We previously identified the induction of a cancer cell-intrinsic interferon response following pharmacological inhibition of METTL3, leading to activation of T-cell-mediated anti-tumour response. Here, we profiled m6A levels at nucleotide resolution using GLORI and characterised RNA changes following METTL3 inhibition with STC-15 or STM3675. Following loss of m6A, we uncovered aberrant mRNA transcripts arising from intron retention (IR) and transcriptional run-on (RO) events downstream of m6A-enriched exons in human cancer cells and in tumour samples in vivo. We found that these IR and RO events produce double-stranded RNA and are bound by the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor MDA5. Using preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, we characterised in detail the anti-tumour immune responses induced by STC-15. Our study reveals how METTL3 inhibition leads to dsRNA accumulation, which triggers a type I interferon response and induces anti-tumour immunity. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for STC-15 as a novel anti-cancer drug both as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Implementing N-terminomics and machine learning to probe Nt-arginylation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shinyeong Ju, Laxman Nawale, +6 authors, Cheolju Lee</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> N-terminal arginylation (Nt-arginylation) is a multifunctional post-translational modification (PTM) with roles in protein quality control, organelle homeostasis and stress signaling, but its study has been limited by technical challenges. Here, we develop an integrated approach combining N-terminomics with machine learning-based filtering to identify in cellulo Nt-arginylation. Using Arg-starting missed cleavage peptides as proxies for ATE1-mediated arginylation, we train a transfer learning model to predict mass spectra and retention times. By applying the prediction models with an additional statistical filter, we identify 134 Nt-arginylation sites in thapsigargin-treated HeLa cells. Arginylation is enriched in proteins from various organelles, especially at caspase cleavage and signal peptide processing sites. Eight of twelve tested proteins are further validated for their interaction with p62 ZZ domain. Temporal profiling reveals that ATF4 increases early post-stress, followed by arginylation at caspase-3 substrates and ER signal-cleaved proteins. Our approach enables sensitive detection of rare N-terminal modifications, offering potential for biomarker and drug target discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CoREST complex inhibition alters RNA splicing to promote neoantigen expression and enhance tumor immunity.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Robert J Fisher, Kihyun Park, +21 authors, Rhoda M Alani</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epigenetic macromolecular enzyme complexes tightly regulate gene expression at the chromatin level and have recently been found to colocalize with RNA splicing machinery during active transcription; however, the precise functional consequences of these interactions are uncertain. Here, we identify unique interactions of the CoREST repressor complex (LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST) with components of the RNA splicing machinery and their functional consequences in tumorigenesis. Using mass spectrometry, in vivo binding assays, and cryo-EM we find that CoREST complex-splicing factor interactions are direct and perturbed by the CoREST complex selective inhibitor, corin, leading to extensive changes in RNA splicing in melanoma and other malignancies. Moreover, these corin-induced splicing changes are shown to promote global effects on oncogenic and survival-associated splice variants leading to a tumor-suppressive phenotype. Using machine learning models, MHC IP-MS, and ELISpot assays we identify thousands of neopeptides derived from unannotated splice sites which generate corin-induced splice-neoantigens that are demonstrated to be immunogenic in vitro. Corin is further shown to reactivate the response to immune checkpoint blockade, effectively sensitizing tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. These data position CoREST complex inhibition as a unique therapeutic opportunity which perturbs oncogenic splicing programs while also creating tumor-associated neoantigens that enhance the immunogenicity of current therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Methylation-based signature to distinguish indolent and aggressive prostate cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liao M, Webster J, +2 authors, Maher CA.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prostate cancer management faces significant challenges in distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease, particularly since most patients are intermediate-risk and therefore hinders the ability to recommend standardized treatment recommendations. Moreover, current prognostic tools including Gleason scoring and tumor staging demonstrate limited accuracy for predicting disease progression and tumor recurrence. DNA methylation serves as a stable epigenetic modification that directly regulates gene expression, making it an ideal biomarker for cancer prognosis. Therefore, this study leveraged whole-genome enzymatic methylation sequencing on 120 patients to develop a novel prognostic signature for aggressive prostate cancer progression. We analyzed 20,849 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and employed multiple machine learning approaches to identify optimal biomarkers. This revealed a 14-region DNA methylation signature that can serve as independent prognostic prediction factors outperforming traditional clinical indices. Further, when combined into a risk score it achieved a clinically meaningful odds ratio. This methylation-based approach provides actionable information for treatment decisions and surveillance strategies, representing a significant advancement toward precision medicine in prostate cancer management through biologically-informed risk stratification.</p>
