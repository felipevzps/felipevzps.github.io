<h2 class="paper-title">Melody: Decoding the Sequence Determinants of Locus-Specific DNA Methylation Across Human Tissues</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jin, J., Wang, D., +7 authors, Wei, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that plays crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and genome stability. However, how locus specific DNA methylation is determined by intrinsic DNA sequence features remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce Melody, a deep learning framework designed to elucidate the sequence determinants underlying human DNA methylation landscapes across multiple tissues. Trained solely on genomic sequence, Melody accurately predicts cell type specific methylation profiles across 39 human tissues, markedly outperforming existing state of the art approaches at the whole chromosome, hypomethylated, and cell type specific levels. Moreover, Melody demonstrates strong generalization in meQTLs variant effect prediction, and Melody reveals key sequence motifs associated with methylation variability. Finally, to extend prediction to unseen cell types, we develop a sequence based model augmented with scRNA seq derived embeddings, enabling accurate inference of cell type specific methylation states directly from transcriptomic data. Together, Melody provides a powerful framework for decoding the genomic and transcriptional logic that governs DNA methylation specificity in the human epigenome.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ubiquitous availability of protein structures permits replacing sequence alignment with more accurate and sensitive structure alignment algorithms. LoL-align maximizes a local log-odds score for proteins to be homologous, given their intra-protein C-C distances.

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic niches enable co-culture bioprocessing but are prone to mutational escape</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vandenbroucke, V., Martinez, J. A., +4 authors, Frank, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stabilizing microbial co-cultures is a central challenge for bioproduction. While division of labor between strains can enhance efficiency, it often results in population instability over time. Classical strategies, including cross-feeding, quorum sensing, and toxin-antitoxin modules, often rely on complex ecological interactions that are difficult to predict or maintain under bioprocess conditions. Here, we introduce synthetic niches as an alternative framework, using genetic toggle switches that couple growth to defined phenotypic states. We engineered two auxotrophic strains, TOGGLE_green and TOGGLE_yellow, in which growth is linked to either GFP- or YFP-expressing states and assessed their behavior in continuous bioreactor cultures using automated flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, the introduction of auxotrophic pressure reshaped circuit function i.e., instead of maintaining bistability, toggle strains behaved as unidirectional inducible systems that reverted upon inducer withdrawal. This feature enabled simplified control with a single input but also revealed a vulnerability to mutational escape under intensified cultivation. A simple repression-based ODE model recapitulated the reversible dynamics, but deviations under prolonged operation highlighted the rapid evolutionary erosion of control. Our findings demonstrate both the potential and the limitations of synthetic niches for co-culture engineering and emphasize the need to integrate evolutionary robustness into the design of next-generation bioprocess control strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">WormSpot: a machine learning-powered viability scoring platform in C. elegans for Candida pathogenicity studies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lee, J. G. W., Ong, V. E. Y., Zhang, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Invasive Candida infections pose a critical health challenge, exacerbated by emerging antifungal resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) offers a genetically tractable and scalable model for studying Candida pathogenicity, yet conventional viability assays remain labor-intensive, limiting high-throughput applications. In this study, we developed a machine learning-driven worm viability scoring platform, WormSpot, using representative images of Candida-infected worm and the robust YOLOv8-based framework. By analyzing static morphological features, our model accurately classifies worm viability post-infection, achieving strong concordance with manual scoring while requiring minimal image input. Validation with well-characterized Candida albicans mutants and antifungal agents confirms the platform's robustness in predicting worm survival trends. Notably, WormSpot performs efficiently with diverse image formats and is compatible with standard multi-well microscopy workflows, enabling automated data analysis and scalable application in various experimental setups. In conclusion, WormSpot provides a data-efficient, reproducible tool for assessing Candida virulence using C. elegans, supporting both basic pathogenicity study and antifungal discovery in high-throughput settings.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MSICKB: A Curated Knowledgebase for Exploring Molecular Heterogeneity and Biomarker Discovery in Microsatellite Instability Cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shen, B., Zhang, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract Background Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a critical form of genomic instability and a key biomarker for predicting patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy in cancer. However, significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes exists even among patients with MSI cancers of the same type, suggesting the presence of distinct molecular subtypes and the need for more personalized biomarkers. The systematic exploration of this heterogeneity is currently hindered by the lack of a specialized, multi-dimensional data resource. This raises a critical scientific question: building upon the established link between MSI status and therapeutic efficacy, how can we leverage a multi-dimensional, deeply curated data resource to precisely characterize the molecular heterogeneity of MSI cancers and discover personalized biomarkers for precision oncology? Methods To address this question, we developed the Microsatellite Instability Cancer Knowledgebase (MSICKB). We systematically curated MSI-related data from 492 publications spanning from 1997 to 2024, covering 31 cancer types. The curated data encompasses four key dimensions: Genetic &amp; Molecular Features, Clinicopathological Features, Therapeutic Response, and Prognostic Factors. Furthermore, we constructed and analyzed a comprehensive gene-disease network to systematically characterize the molecular landscape of MSI cancers. Results MSICKB(http://www.sysbio.org.cn/MSICKB/) curates a total of 1,382 MSI-related features from 492 publications, covering 31 cancer types. The knowledgebase includes four major categories: Genetic &amp; Molecular Features, Clinicopathological Features, Prognostic Factors, and Therapeutic Response. An application analysis of the curated data revealed that the constructed gene-disease network exhibits a scale-free-like topology, indicating a hierarchical organization governed by a few highly connected hub nodes. Further investigation of the 14 identified hub genes showed significant functional enrichment in core MSI-related pathways, including DNA mismatch repair, immune checkpoint regulation, and key oncogenic signaling pathways. Conclusion MSICKB provides an integrated, multi-dimensional data resource that facilitates the exploration of the molecular heterogeneity landscape and common regulatory principles within MSI cancers. It serves as a valuable platform for identifying novel molecular subtypes and biomarkers. In the future, the continuous evolution of MSICKB will support the development of clinical prediction models, assist in the advancement of intelligent medicine, and ultimately promote the progress of precision diagnostics and therapeutics for MSI cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatial and Single-Cell Transcriptomics Decipher the Crosstalk Environment of DEFB1+ Cancer Cells and IFI30+ Macrophages in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, G., Meng, H., +3 authors, Qu, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare but highly aggressive primary liver malignancy distinguished by a profoundly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, which underlies its limited response to targeted and immunebased therapies. Deciphering the cellular composition and intercellular signaling within this complex ecosystem is critical to understanding ICC progression and to identifying actionable therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to construct a comprehensive cellular and transcriptional atlas of human ICC. Our analyses revealed a continuous trajectory of T-cell state transition from activation to exhaustion, with CD8+ proliferating T cells exhibiting two distinct exhaustion programs, namely terminal and progenitor-like exhaustion. Notably, DEFB1+ cholangiocytes and IFI30+ macrophages displayed a strong positive correlation across independent ICC cohorts and were found in close spatial proximity within the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, their interaction appears to be mediated by the TGFB1/TGFBR1 signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance. Together, these findings delineate the cellular architecture and spatial organization of the ICC microenvironment, uncovering a key cholangiocyte/macrophage axis that shapes immune dysfunction and offers a potential therapeutic entry point to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in ICC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Extracting host-specific developmental signatures from longitudinal microbiome data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Erdos, B., Chatzis, C., +4 authors, Acar, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Longitudinal microbiome studies provide critical insights into microbial community dynamics and their relation to host health. Tensor decompositions offer a powerful framework for the unsupervised analysis of such data, yielding interpretable low-dimensional temporal patterns. However, existing approaches based on the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model assume common temporal dynamics for all subjects and therefore cannot capture subject-specific trajectories. Results: To address this limitation, we propose to use the PARAFAC2 model, a more flexible tensor decomposition method to explicitly model subject-specific variations, such as shifts and delays in temporal patterns. Through systematic comparisons on simulated and real-world datasets--including studies of infant gut maturation and dietary interventions--we demonstrate that PARAFAC2 outperforms CP in capturing subject-specific temporal trajectories, and enables the discovery of biologically relevant patterns that are overlooked by CP. Furthermore, we introduce replicability as a robust criterion for selecting the number of components and demonstrate that the extracted patterns are replicable. Availability and implementation: Code and data for reproducing the results of this paper are available at https://github.com/blzserdos/parafac2_microbiome and archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17674126.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CLEAR-AF: Improved Autofluorescence Subtraction for Multiplexed Tissue Imaging via Polar Transformation and Gaussian Mixture Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Arnould, A., De Moor, B., +2 authors, Antoranz, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyclic Multiplexed ImmunoFluorescence (cMIF) can profile dozens to hundreds of proteins at subcellular resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue architecture in health and disease. However, measured signals are affected by tissue autofluorescence (AF), which can confound molecular quantifications at the single-cell level. Existing computational strategies to subtract AF are not sensitive nor specific enough and often leave residual background or over subtract weak markers. To address current limitations, we introduce CLEAR-AF (Coordinate-transformed Local Estimation and Adaptive Removal of AutoFluorescence), a subtraction framework where AF is calibrated for each acquired signal using a reference image. CLEAR-AF maps these intensities into polar coordinates to disentangle AF from true signal, and applies adaptive, distribution-aware thresholding to estimate and remove AF locally. Across multiple cMIF technologies, CLEAR-AF yields cleaner marker channels with improved specificity, greater sensitivity, and higher reproducibility relative to common AF removal approaches. By delivering more accurate per-cell measurements without workflow changes to acquisition, CLEAR-AF provides a practical, platform-agnostic step towards more reliable spatial proteomics at scale.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">From Circles to Signals: Representation Learning on Ultra-Long Extrachromosomal Circular DNA</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, J., Liu, Z., +2 authors, Singh, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a covalently closed circular DNA molecule that plays an important role in cancer biology. Genomic foundation models have recently emerged as a powerful direction for DNA sequence modeling, enabling the direct prediction of biologically relevant properties from DNA sequences. Although recent genomic foundation models have shown strong performance on general DNA sequence modeling, their application to eccDNA remains limited: existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive attention mechanisms or truncate ultra-long sequences into kilobase fragments, thereby disrupting long-range continuity and ignoring the molecule's circular topology. To overcome these problems, we introduce eccDNAMamba, a bidirectional state space model (SSM) built upon the Mamba-2 framework, which scales linearly with input sequence length and enables scalable modeling of ultra-long eccDNA sequences. eccDNAMamba further incorporates a circular augmentation strategy to preserve the intrinsic circular topology of eccDNA. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art genomic foundation models demonstrate that eccDNAMamba achieves superior performance on ultra-long sequences across multiple task settings, such as cancer versus healthy eccDNA discrimination and eccDNA copy-number level prediction, and real versus pseudo-eccDNA discrimination. Moreover, the Integrated Gradient (IG) based model explanation indicates that eccDNAMamba focuses on biologically meaningful regulatory elements and can uncover key sequence patterns in cancer-derived eccDNAs. Overall, these results demonstrate that eccDNAMamba effectively models ultra-long eccDNA sequences by leveraging their unique circular topology and regulatory architecture, bridging a critical gap in sequence analysis. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/zzq1zh/eccDNAMamba.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">JADE: Joint Alignment and Deep Embedding for Multi-Slice Spatial Transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guo, Y., Liu, J., +1 author, Ma, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) datasets increasingly span multiple adjacent or replicated slices, effective joint analysis across slices is needed to reconstruct tissue structures and identify consistent spatial gene expression patterns. This requires resolving spatial correspondences between slices while capturing shared transcriptomic features, two tasks that are typically addressed in isolation. Multi-slice analysis remains challenging due to physical distortions, technical variability, and batch effects. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Alignment and Deep Embedding for multi-slice SRT (JADE), a unified computational framework that simultaneously learns spatial location-wise alignments and shared low-dimensional embeddings across tissue slices. Unlike existing methods, JADE adopts a roundtrip framework in which each iteration alternates between alignment and embedding refinement. To infer alignment, we employ attention mechanisms that dynamically assess and weight the importance of different embedding dimensions, allowing the model to focus on the most alignment-relevant features while suppressing noise. To the best of our knowledge, JADE is the first method that jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning in a shared latent space, enabling robust multi-slice integration. We demonstrate that JADE outperforms existing alignment and embedding methods across multiple evaluation metrics in the 10x Visium human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and Stereo-seq axolotl brain datasets. By bridging spatial alignment and feature integration, JADE provides a scalable and accurate solution for cross-slice analysis of SRT data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Sensitizing tumor response to topoisomerase I antibody drug conjugate by selective CDK7 inhibition</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jung, H., Lee, Y., +13 authors, Kim, T.-K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the transcriptional impact of Q901, a highly selective CDK7 inhibitor in clinical development. Q901 primarily disrupted MYC and E2F-dependent transcription program, downregulating cell cycle control and DNA damage repair pathways. CDK7 binding at the promoter-proximal regions was dramatically stabilized by Q901, leading to reduced occupancy of MYC, E2F, and RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). These findings offered a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance cancer susceptibility to TOP1-DNA protein crosslinks (TOP1-DPCs) induced by TOP1 inhibitors. Resistance to TOP1 inhibitors arises through activation of DNA repair pathway when elongating RNAPII encounters TOP1-DPCs. By suppressing RNAPII transition from initiation to elongation and DNA repair pathways, Q901 stabilizes TOP1-DPCs and sensitizes tumor to TOP1 inhibitors. Preclinical studies demonstrated enhanced tumor suppression when combining Q901 with TOP1 inhibitor-based antibody-drug conjugates (TOP1i-ADCs), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic option for cancers resistant to TOP1i-ADC therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Oxymatrine Induces Ferroptosis in MKN28 Gastric Cancer Cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ma, L., Mian, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study aimed to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of oxymatrine (OMT) on MKN28 gastric cancer cells. Through a series of experiments including CCK8 cell viability assay, lipid peroxidation level detection, and Fe2+ concentration measurement, it was found that OMT significantly inhibited the viability of MKN28 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. OMT could induce an increase in intracellular lipid peroxidation level and iron ion concentration, while activating ferroptosis-related signaling pathways, indicating that OMT can induce ferroptosis in MKN28 cells. This study provides a new theoretical basis and potential target for the application of OMT in gastric cancer treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Overexpression of TPM4 promotes cancer progression through EMT in anaplastic thyroid cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ying, H., Zhou, Y., +6 authors, Qian, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an undifferentiated tumour originating from thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most malignant subtype of thyroid cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying ATC development are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms driving ATC invasion and metastasis to provide novel insights into its aggressive behavior. Through an integrated bioinformatics analysis of the GEO database, we identified Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) as a differentially expressed gene in ATC. Bioinformatic correlation and pathway enrichment analyses suggested that TPM4 expression is potentially linked to tumor cell invasion and lymph node metastasis. We showed that TPM4 was highly expressed in both ATC tissues and cell lines, and its expression levels were positively correlated with enhanced cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies indicated that TPM4 likely enhances tumour cell migration and invasion by facilitating cytoskeletal remodeling and promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our findings suggest that TPM4 represents a promising diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for ATC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inactivation of a protein hydroxylase complex impairs replication fork restart in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kennedy, T. J., Fletcher, S., +5 authors, Coleman, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein hydroxylation is a post-translational modification that is commonly catalysed by enzymes of the oxygen- and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase family. The Jumonji-C (JmjC)-only sub-family of 2OG-oxygenases catalyse the hydroxylation of protein and tRNA substrates involved in fundamental cellular processes. Jumonji-domain 5 (JMJD5) is a highly conserved and essential 2OG-oxygenase that, thus far, is the only arginyl hydroxylase assigned in eukaryotes. We recently reported that JMJD5 hydroxylase activity is required for DNA replication fidelity, and that pathogenic variants cause replication stress (RS) and genome instability (GIN) in a novel neurodevelopmental disorder. Because of the prevalence of RS and GIN in cancer, and reported roles of JMJD5 in tumorigenesis, we here investigate the impact of JMJD5 cancer mutations on its role in replication fidelity. We describe the structural impact of cancer missense mutations on the hydroxylase activity of JMJD5 and its interaction with RCCD1, an abundant binding partner encoded by a gene associated with susceptibility to a variety of tumour types. We show that the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction is disrupted by cancer mutations and that the complex is essential for suppressing RS and GIN in tumour cells. Finally, we describe a novel interaction of the complex with RAD51 paralogues and demonstrate the importance of the JMJD5:RCCD1 interaction for normal replication fork restart. Our findings further highlight the importance of protein hydroxylases in fundamental cellular processes and the consequences of JMJD5 and RCCD1 deregulation in human disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning driven multiomics analysis identifies disulfidptosis associated molecular subtypes in ovarian cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qiaoying Jin, Zhaobin Chang, +3 authors, Yonggang Lu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precision oncology enables molecularly guided cancer therapy through multi-omics profiling, AI-driven classification, and biomarker-targeted interventions. Disulfidptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, yet no ovarian cancer classification system currently incorporates this mechanism. The sequencing data of the samples in this study were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. We analyzed 76 genes associated with disulfidptosis and performed consensus clustering based on their expression profiles to stratify the samples into two molecular subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing ovarian cancer tissues with normal samples. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were then applied to screen marker genes that significantly influenced the clustering outcome. Ultimately, Ten disulfidptosis-related genes were ultimately selected to construct the predictive model. Single-cell sequencing was employed to characterize the tumor-specific expression patterns of key biomarkers. Digital spatial pathology analysis precisely mapped therapeutic target regions within tumor architectures. Immunohistochemical validation ultimately yielded clinically translatable biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Analysis of 76 disulfidptosis-related genes in ovarian cancer (OV) identified two molecular subtypes with distinct genomic profiles, tumor microenvironment characteristics, m6A regulator expression patterns, and clinical outcomes. Subgroup 1 showed copy number gains and immunosuppression, while Subgroup 2 exhibited higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immune activation. Subgroup 2 exhibited significantly higher immune infiltration, along with upregulated immune checkpoints. A 10-gene signature and CNN+GRU classifier robustly stratified patients. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics confirmed epithelial-specific overexpression of key genes. This study identified a 10-gene signature related to disulfidptosis that is associated with distinct tumor microenvironment features, molecular heterogeneity, m6A modification patterns, and immune infiltration characteristics in ovarian cancer. Through multi-omics analyses-including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics-along with protein-level validation, our findings provide insights into the molecular landscape of ovarian cancer and suggest potential targets for future investigation into subtype-specific treatment strategies.
