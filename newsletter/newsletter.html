<h2 class="paper-title">An engineered multi-step differentiation program in Escherichia coli for self-organized spatial patterning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Boni, E., Siboulet, H., +4 authors, Schaerli, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In nature, complex multicellular structures originate from individual cells containing all essential information for differentiation, patterning and morphogenesis. Synthetic biology enables a bottom-up approach to study these processes by engineering and combining individual modules to progressively increase the system's complexity. Here, we engineered a multi-step differentiation program in the model prokaryote Escherichia coli. Starting from genetically identical cells and without providing any external positional information, we generated autonomous spatial patterns of colonies on a solid surface. We first employed a toggle switch to break population homogeneity (symmetry breaking), stochastically differentiating cells into two subpopulations: senders and receivers. Next, we enabled further differentiation of receiver colonies located in close proximity to sender colonies via quorum-sensing based communication (paracrine signaling). Finally, the newly emerged population matured into a different cell type via an orthogonal, self-activating, quorum sensing signal (autocrine signaling). The diversity of spatial patterns generated by this multi-step program was accurately captured by simulations of a corresponding mathematical model. Together, these results demonstrate that multi-step differentiation programs can be engineered in unicellular bacteria to drive fully self-organized spatial pattern formation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biomolecular condensation using de novo designed globular proteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Romanyuk, A., Kumar, R. T. P., +5 authors, Woolfson, D. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> De novo protein design is advancing rapidly, but many targets remain inaccessible to current AI-based tools. Here we describe de novo designed globular domains that drive biomolecular condensation. Starting from a water-soluble, monomeric protein, we make variants with the same amino-acid composition but different surface-charge distributions: one with large patches of surface charge, and another with a more-homogeneous charge distribution. The individual domains form stable and discrete structures in solution, with the large-patch variant exhibiting more-attractive interprotein interactions. Next, two copies of each variant are joined with disordered linkers to generate dumbbell-like proteins. When expressed in eukaryotic cells, the large-patch variant forms intracellular puncta, whereas that with small patches does not. The assemblies are dynamic, liquid condensates in vitro and in cells. The structured domains facilitate functionalisation: we introduce fluorophore-binding sites to visualise fluorescent condensates directly in cells without a GFP reporter; and we manipulate the condensates using motor proteins.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification, evolutionary history and characteristics of orphan genes in root-knot nematodes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seckin, E., Colinet, D., +4 authors, Danchin, E. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Orphan genes, lacking homologs in other species, are systematically found across genomes. Their presence may result from extensive divergence from pre-existing genes or from de novo gene birth, which occurs when a gene emerges from a previously non-genic region. In this study, we identified orphan genes in the genomes of globally distributed plant-parasitic nematodes of the genus Meloidogyne and investigated their origins, evolution, and characteristics. Using a comparative genomics framework across 85 nematode species, we found that 18% of Meloidogyne genes are genus-specific, transcriptionally supported orphans. By combining ancestral sequence reconstruction and synteny-based approaches, we inferred that 20% of these orphan genes originated through high divergence, while 18% likely emerged de novo. Proteomic and translatomic evidence confirmed the translation of a subset of these genes, and feature analyses revealed distinctive molecular signatures, including shorter length, signal peptide enrichment, and a tendency for extracellular localization. These findings highlight orphan genes as a substantial and previously underexplored component of the Meloidogyne genome, with potential roles in their worldwide parasitism.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fold or flop: quality assessment of AlphaFold predictions on whole proteomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sarti, E., Cazals, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reliability of AlphaFold predictions is primarily assessed by the method's self-reported score predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT). For model organisms, AlphaFold predictions show that 30% to 40% of all amino acids fall into the low-confidence range of pLDDT. Moreover, pLDDT has occasionally failed to flag predictions that are physically implausible. This raises two fundamental questions: can we identify more robust indicators of reliability, and do unreliable predictions exhibit shared structural or biophysical traits? To address these questions, we introduce semi-global statistics characterizing packing properties at multiple scales, and performing dimensionality reduction and clustering at once. We use these to perform a systematic whole-proteome structural quality assessment of prediction contained in the AlphaFold Database (AFDB), investigating connections between unreliable predictions, fold classification, and intrinsic disorder propensity. Our results reveal consistent relationships between low-confidence predictions, clustering of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and distinctive packing properties, thereby highlighting both strengths and limitations of current self-assessment metrics. This work provides a framework for deeper confidence assessment of AlphaFold predictions and offers generalizable strategies for distinguishing reliable from unreliable structural models.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Characterizing the fragmentation of AlphaFold predictions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sarti, E., Cazals, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Nobel prize winning program AlphaFold computes plausible structures of (well) folded proteins. The main quality assessment is based on the predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT), a per amino acid confidence score. To enhance quality assessment, we provide novel quantitative measures to identify coherent amino acid (a.a.) stretches along the sequence in terms of pLDDT values. These measures, which rely on standard tools from topological data analysis and combinatorics, qualify the coherence / fragmentation of AlphaFold predictions. The outcome of our analysis can readily be used to select reliable regions/domains within proteins whose pLDDT values span the entire pLDDT range.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProFam: Open-Source Protein Family Language Modelling for Fitness Prediction and Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wells, J., Hawkins Hooker, A., +8 authors, Heinzinger, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein language models have become essential tools for engineering novel functional proteins. The emerging paradigm of family-based language models makes use of homologous sequences to steer protein design and enhance zero-shot fitness prediction, by imbuing models with an ability to explicitly reason over evolutionary context. To provide an open foundation for this modelling approach, we introduce ProFam-1, a 251M-parameter autoregressive protein family language model (pfLM) trained with next-token prediction on millions of protein families represented as concatenated, unaligned sets of sequences. ProFam-1 is competitive with state-of-the-art models on the ProteinGym zero-shot fitness prediction benchmark, achieving Spearman correlations of 0.47 for substitutions and 0.53 for indels. For homology-guided generation, ProFam-1 generates diverse sequences with predicted structural similarity, while preserving residue conservation and covariance patterns. All of ProFam's training and inference pipelines, together with our curated, large-scale training dataset ProFam Atlas, are released fully open source, lowering the barrier to future method development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identifying membrane-bound transcriptional regulatory proteins from rare but evolutionarily conserved domain combinations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lee, M., Jang, Y., +2 authors, Marcotte, E. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcriptional regulatory proteins, including transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin modifiers, must act inside cell nuclei, but membrane-bound transcription factors (MBTFs) are first anchored in membranes before nuclear translocation. Known MBTFs are vital for processes from myelin expression (MYRF) to cholesterol homeostasis (SREBP), yet their overall diversity remains uncharted. We hypothesized that additional membrane-bound transcriptional regulators (MBTRs) might exist, so we developed a bioinformatics screen to prioritize membrane proteins that are likely to regulate transcription. Our approach leverages domain composition by positing that surprising domain combinations suggest novel biological functions. We searched for rare but evolutionarily conserved pairings of transmembrane domains with domains likely involved in transcriptional regulation. Our method rediscovered known MBTFs and membrane-bound histone kinases, and identified novel MBTR candidates, including transmembrane histone N-acetyltransferases, a putative new subclass of MBTFs that share MYRF's DNA-binding domain, and the prolactin regulatory element-binding protein PREB (SEC12). Assays using recombinant PREB demonstrated that the transmembrane domain is the determinant of PREB subcellular localization, governing its distribution between the membrane and the nucleus in mouse embryonic stem cells. These findings underscore the utility of our method and provide a framework for investigating MBTRs that likely facilitate the integration of extracellular signals with transcriptional responses.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omics analysis of TNBC organoids identifies phosphorylation of the membrane trafficking machinery as a key event associated with FER-mediated invasion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Elshout, C., Mota, G., +22 authors, Tavares, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is characterised by unfavourable outcome due to the combination of its metastatic propensity, chemo-refractory behaviour and the lack of effective targeted interventions. Expression of the feline sarcoma-related (FER) kinase constitutes an independent prognostic factor that correlates with poor patient survival. FER promotes invasive behaviour in TNBC cells by regulating endosomal sorting and recycling (ESR) of adhesion proteins. Yet, the ESR machinery supporting invasion in TNBC, particularly within 3D environments, remains poorly understood. Here, we used FER-expressing TNBC patient-derived xenograft organoids (PDXOs) and MDA-MB-231 cells to identify the membrane trafficking machinery promoting invasion. Using a combination of proteomics, phospho-proteomics, and single cell RNA-sequencing, we show that the invasion of FER-expressing PDXO cells in collagen-I is mainly associated with the differential phosphorylation of membrane trafficking regulators, including SEC16A and a marked increase in Rab4-positive tubules. SEC16A depletion impairs cell invasion and reduces the number of focal adhesions and Rab4-positive tubules. Importantly, FER regulates SEC16A levels and localization, specifically in TNBC. Altogether, we identified SEC16A as a key player in FER-driven TNBC invasion, highlighting the membrane trafficking machinery as a promising target for the development of new therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Lalier, L., Guillonneau, F., +6 authors, Juin, P. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acquisition of secondary resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells is an ill-characterized multi-step process. We conducted a non-supervised, global proteomic analysis of U251 glioma cells treated by temozolomide as they transit from drug-sensitive to tolerant and then resistant states. This unprecedented analysis revealed key mitochondrial evolutions throughout the process. Following an early stress substantiated by a transient peak of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial quality control mechanisms enable emergence of the resistant population. We combined genome editing, targeted protein degradation via PROTAC, and pharmacologic inhibitors to investigate the mechanisms underlying stress resolution both at population and single cell scales (including microscopic evaluation and in-situ proximity ligation assays). These studies unravel a Src-activated EGFR and TBK1 axis that initiates autophagic recycling of mitochondria as a necessary step to the emergence of the resistant population.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">T CELLS promote the growth of small-cell lung carcinoma via an IL-6/CD74 axis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Baron, M., Ginestet, Z., +7 authors, Sage, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A central challenge in immuno-oncology is overcoming the limited efficacy and durability of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). This is particularly true in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), where chemotherapy plus ICI is standard of care but rarely curative. Here, we found that T cells are surprisingly both necessary and sufficient for optimal tumor growth in mouse models of SCLC. These pro-tumoral effects are mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, which induces the pro-survival factor CD74 in SCLC cells. Notably, T cells within human SCLC tumors express IL-6, and low IL-6 signaling correlates with improved survival following chemotherapy plus ICI in patients. Accordingly, IL-6 blockade synergizes with ICI to inhibit SCLC growth in vivo. These findings reveal a paradoxical role for T cells in SCLC, uncovering an unexpected T cell-IL-6-CD74 axis that promotes tumor survival, and identify IL-6 as a promising target to help unleash the full potential of immunotherapy in this aggressive cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genetic Drivers of Sensitivity or Resistance to RAS(ON) Multi-Selective Inhibitors in NRAS-Mutated Melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Foth, M., Kim, W., O'Toole, K. T., +24 authors, McMahon, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most patients with advanced BRAF or NRAS-driven melanoma receive front-line immunotherapy. However, if immunotherapy fails, BRAF-mutated patients have effective second-line therapies, whereas NRAS-mutated patients lack pathway-targeted options. Recently, RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors like RMC-7977, and the investigational agent daraxonrasib, were described that, in partnership with cyclophilin-A (CYPA), inhibit RAS[GTP] signaling. Both compounds demonstrate potent anti-proliferative activity against NRAS-mutated melanoma cell lines and robust anti-tumor activity against preclinical melanoma models. However, in preclinical models, resistance to RMC-7977 monotherapy arose through mutations in Ppia (encoding CYPA) or Map2k1 (encoding MEK1). Moreover, two clinical case studies in patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma treated with daraxonrasib demonstrated clear anti-tumor activity in one patient, but progressive disease in another with co-occurring NRAS and MAP2K1 mutations at baseline. These findings support the potential for daraxonrasib in treatment of patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma, and reveal candidate mechanisms of monotherapy resistance, underscoring the need for combination therapies to improve outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide, characterized by late diagnosis, limited therapeutic options, and dismal prognosis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of tumor biology, yet the role of S-nitrosylation-a redox-based cysteine modification-has not been systematically investigated in PC.</p>
