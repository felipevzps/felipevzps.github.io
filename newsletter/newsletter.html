<h2 class="paper-title">Multimodal Fusion of mpMRI Radiomics, Clinical Features, and Hematological Biomarkers Enhances Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhu Y, Yang Z, +4 authors, Qian L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To develop and validate an interpretable machine-learning model for early prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) by fusing multiparametric MRI radiomics, clinical variables, and hematological biomarkers. A total of 172 patients (115 BCR-positive, 57 BCR-negative), who underwent RP with a median follow-up of 37 months, from Taizhou People's Hospital were retrospectively enrolled. Preoperative ADC and T2-weighted images were manually segmented to extract radiomic features; laboratory and clinical data included PSA, routine blood counts, lipid profile, and coagulation indices. After LASSO selection, seven machine-learning algorithms were trained and internally validated. The best-performing model was interpreted with SHAP analysis to quantify feature contributions. PSA emerged as the dominant predictor, exhibiting the highest mean absolute SHAP value and thereby exerting the greatest influence on model output. Among coagulation parameters, D-dimer and APTT were significantly associated with BCR (p = 0.007 and p = 0.036, respectively). Integration of ADC + T2 radiomics with clinical/hematological variables via a SVM classifier yielded the highest performance: AUC 0.916 (95% CI: 0.891-0.941) in the training set and 0.820 (95% CI: 0.762-0.878) in the validation set. SHAP revealed that ADC/T2 radiomic features constituted 60% of the top-ten predictors, while D-dimer exhibited a paradoxical negative SHAP value, suggesting a potential protective association. Multimodal fusion of mpMRI radiomics, clinical feature, and hematological biomarkers substantially improves BCR prediction. The interpretable model highlights PSA, and coagulation dysfunction, as key recurrence drivers, offering a clinically actionable tool for personalized management.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of Six Potential Therapeutic Targets Common to Ischemic Stroke and Vascular Dementia: Genetic Insights From an Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lyu J, Lin F, +7 authors, Xie Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The aim was to investigate the potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke (IS) and vascular dementia (VD).We assessed the causal effects of 2943 plasma proteins on IS and VD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Results were validated via summary data-based MR (SMR) analysis. A two-step mediation MR analysis was conducted to elucidate potential causal mechanisms by which plasma proteins influence IS and VD through risk factors. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) MR analysis to explore side effects and additional indications for IS and VD-associated plasma proteins. We established middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) and VD rat models to verify potential therapeutic targets for IS and VD.Genetically predicted plasma levels of six proteins demonstrated causal relationships with both IS and VD. SMR analysis validated four of these proteins (CD40, F11, F2, and Furin). Atrial fibrillation (AF), type 2 diabetes (T2D), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were causally associated with the risk of IS and VD, indicating common risk factors. CD40 and Furin associations with IS and VD appeared to be mediated by AF or DBP. The mechanisms of action of IS- and VD-related proteins primarily involve the complement and coagulation cascade. In vivo experiments confirmed that CD40, Furin, F11, and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) were causally associated with IS and VD.Our findings illuminate causal pathways and potential therapeutic targets for IS and VD. We identified six plasma proteins with causal relationships to IS, VD, and their risk factors, providing insights into using these proteins as therapeutic targets for IS and VD.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unveiling Heterogeneity: Innovations and Challenges in Single-Vesicle Analysis for Clinical Translation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang Y, Meng X, +13 authors, Yin H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication, carrying diverse molecular cargo that reflects the dynamic physiological and pathological state of their source cell. While analyses of the entire vesicular population (bulk EV) have advanced our understanding of their roles in health and disease, these approaches often obscure the heterogeneity inherent in EV populations. Emerging single-vesicle analysis technologies offer unprecedented resolution, enabling the identification of individual EV subpopulations and their distinct molecular signatures. Such approaches, combined with digital platforms, can now analyze individual molecules from single EVs, including single-molecule features such as protein, mRNA, double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA. This perspective explores the transformative potential of single EV technologies in clinical diagnostics and therapeutic applications. We highlight key advancements including microfluidic platforms, super-resolution microscopy and AI-driven data analyses, that are shaping and advancing the field and its applications. With the development and advancement of clinically viable single EV technologies, we are beginning to appreciate the complexity and abundance of cell type and specific EVs. We further discussed the challenges of sensitivity, specificity, standardization and scalability hindering these technologies' broad acceptance and feasibility in clinical translation. This perspective paper originates from discussions at the Chinese Society of Extracellular Vesicles (CSEV) annual meeting, held in Guangzhou, China, on 16 November 2024. At this meeting, researchers from various fields of EV research, with a particular emphasis on single EV digital, analytical and quantitative technological platforms, discussed the opportunities and challenges of this emerging single-EV-focused technology. The paper aims to provide a roadmap for integrating single EV technologies into routine EV-research and even clinical practice, paving the way for novel scientific and diagnostic tools, personalized therapies, and a deeper understanding of EV heterogeneity and EV biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">LaCONIC: A Label-Aware and Graph-Guided Contrastive Multi-Omics Collaborative Learning Model for Cancer Risk Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, P., Liang, X., Luo, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Investigating accurate cancer survival prediction models has important clinical value for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Although an increasing number of models have shifted from relying solely on clinical variables to integrating multi-omics data, there remains insufficient exploitation and integrative utilization of gene regulatory network (GRN) structures and cancer subtype information, which limits the predictive accuracy and biological interpretability of multi-omics models. Therefore, this study proposes label-aware and graph-guided multi-omics collaborative learning framework, termed LaCONIC, to achieve accurate and interpretable cancer survival prediction. To obtain biologically meaningful regulatory features of different molecular types, we first construct a gene regulatory network comprising multiple molecular entities and their relations, and design a heterogeneous graph self-supervised pre-training module to obtain unified graph-based gene representations. To fully leverage multi-omics and multi-modal information, we develop an adaptive cross-omics representation learning module that performs intra-omics modality alignment (i.e., graph and expression modals) and inter-omics representation alignment, thereby achieving synergistic integration of multi-source information. Moreover, to comprehensively capture global cross-omics molecular interactions, we present a graph-guided cross-omics interactive learning module that explicitly encodes gene regulatory network priors within a Transformer-based architecture. Finally, we introduce cancer subtype information to construct a label-aware constraint mechanism that improves predictive performance while enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency of the learned representations. Experiments on multiple cancer datasets show that LaCONIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various metrics. SHAP-based interpretability analysis on breast cancer further identifies survival-associated regulatory modules and high-risk molecules (e.g., hsa-miR-148a-3p, ARMC1, TMEM242), highlighting its potential for biological mechanism elucidation and prognostic assessment.

<h2 class="paper-title">Sample-level modeling of single-cell data at scale with tinydenseR</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Milanez-Almeida, P., Schildknecht, D., +14 authors, Orlando, E. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell studies now routinely encompass hundreds of samples and millions of cells, offering unprecedented opportunities to link sample-level phenotypes with cellular and molecular states. However, current workflows often depend on cell-level inference and rigid clustering, which can distort significance and obscure subtle, continuous variation, in particular for complex experimental designs. Here, we present tinydenseR, a clustering-independent framework that enables robust, scalable, and statistically sensitive detection of differential cell states, outperforming existing workflows in speed, memory usage, and biological resolution. Technology-agnostic at its core, tinydenseR works seamlessly on scRNA-seq, flow, mass and spectral cytometry. Across synthetic benchmarks, a preclinical xenograft model, two immuno-oncology trials and a multi-study atlas, tinydenseR uncovers disease and treatment history-associated effects, including subtle within-cluster heterogeneity. Designed to accelerate discovery in clinical, preclinical, and translational research, the open-source package is available at GitHub.com/Novartis/tinydenseR.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Towards improved particle averaging for single-molecule localization microscopy using geometric deep learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mindroc-Filimon, D., Helmerich, D., +2 authors, Kollmannsberger, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can resolve intracellular structures down to the nanoscale, but often produces sparse and incomplete data. Particle averaging (PA) can aid with the reconstruction of complete structures, but traditional PA methods can suffer from template bias or the high computational costs of geometric alignment. To address these limitations, we developed a geometric deep learning (GDL) framework for enhanced, template-free 3D particle averaging. Our pipeline uses a GDL autoencoder, trained on realistic simulated data, to map incomplete point clouds into a robust latent space. By averaging feature vectors directly within this space, our method bypasses the need for explicit 3D alignment. We validated our approach on simulated DNA origami and experimental nuclear pore complex (NPC) data. The latent space averaging successfully reconstructed NPC structures with key metrics (ring radius ~46 nm, ring distance ~52 nm) that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a viable GDL pipeline for SMLM analysis, offering an efficient alternative to traditional PA. While the current model requires structure-specific training, our results highlight the significant potential of GDL for quantitative structural biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An ultra-low background far-red light-responsive optogenetic tool based on an engineered biliverdin-binding domain</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Le, G. N. T., Pham, L. M. T., +2 authors, Woolley, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The robustness and broad applicability of an optogenetic tool depends heavily on the properties of the underlying photoreceptor protein and its cognate binding partner - the light responsive 'core'. Current red light optogenetic systems for use in mammalian cells all rely on phytochrome based photoreceptors. These are large (70 kDa) proteins that act as dimers, thereby enforce dimerization on attached proteins. Naturally occurring or engineered binding partners can function effectively in certain cases, but large size, complex mode of interaction, background binding, relatively weak affinity and/or low fold changes between on and off states are significant limitations. Using structure-based design and directed evolution we developed a small (17 kDa) monomeric bilverdin binding photoreceptor FenixS, and a highly selective, high-affinity binder, Ash1 (6 kDa). Negligible off-state binding and a &gt;1200-fold increase in binding affinity upon 700 nm illumination result in a high performance, ultra-low background, light responsive core for a diverse range of applications. An optogenetic tool for red light activation of transcription in mammalian cells based on the FenixS-Ash1 core exhibits robust performance without the need for biliverdin supplementation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MIMEco: Multi-objective metabolic modeling to predict and explain pairwise interactions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lambert, A., Chaffron, S., Eveillard, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a mechanistic framework for quantitatively exploring an organism's physiology and its interactions with the environment. However, their use in microbial community modeling has been limited since it usually relies on community-wide objective functions or the integration of community abundance data. Nevertheless, predicting microbial interactions is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics, and thus requires dedicated methods. Here, we introduce MIMEco (Metabolic Interaction Modeling in Ecosystems), an open-source Python package that predicts pairwise microbial interactions through multi-objective optimization. MIMEco does not require abundance data, provides a user-friendly workflow, and predicts interaction types, strengths, and exchanged metabolites directly from Pareto fronts. In this study, MIMEco is validated by replicating experimental results of an in vitro co-culture of two auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains. By combining mechanistic inference with usability, MIMEco makes metabolic interaction modeling accessible to non-specialists while remaining flexible for experts, establishing a versatile platform for advancing metabolic ecology across biomedical and environmental fields.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Long, K., Bhattacharjee, D., +20 authors, Sheltzer, J. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Re-evaluating existing clinical compounds can uncover previously unrecognized mechanisms that reshape a drug's therapeutic potential. The small molecule Procaspase-Activating Compound 1 (PAC-1) entered oncology testing as a proposed activator of caspase-driven apoptosis. Here, we show that PAC-1-driven cytotoxicity occurs in the absence of executioner caspase expression, demonstrating that its anti-cancer activity occurs via an alternative mechanism. We provide genetic, biochemical, and biophysical evidence demonstrating that PAC-1 functions as a highly selective iron chelator that eliminates cancer cells by disrupting iron homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we discovered that expression of the key chemotherapy-resistance pump MDR1 confers marked hypersensitivity to PAC-1 treatment. While PAC-1 is only weakly effluxed by MDR1 under basal conditions, this process is potentiated when PAC-1 is bound to iron. Consequently, PAC-1 induces progressive iron depletion and selective cytotoxicity in otherwise drug-resistant MDR1-expressing cancer cells. Together, these findings redefine PAC-1's mechanism-of-action and establish a framework for exploiting multidrug resistance as a therapeutic vulnerability through targeted iron starvation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DYRK1A regulates cancer cell and cancer-associated fibroblast secretomes to foster an immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pascual-Sabater, S., Varhadi, S., +2 authors, Fillat, C., de la Luna, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a desmoplastic, immunosuppressive stroma dominated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Paracrine signals from cancer cells and CAFs shape the tumor microenvironment (TME), facilitating interactions that drive tumor growth and immune evasion, yet the molecular regulators of this crosstalk remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Dual-specificity Tyrosine-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A), previously shown to promote PDAC growth by stabilizing c-MET in cancer cells, is also expressed in CAFs at levels comparable to those in cancer cells. Secretome profiling of DYRK1A-depleted cancer cells and CAFs by quantitative mass spectrometry revealed DYRK1A-dependent factors in each cell type associated with terms related to cell migration, while combining the DYRK1A-regulated proteins from both compartments highlighted additional categories associated with immune infiltration and cell-cell interactions in the TME. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A reduced CCL2, CCL5 and CSF-1 secretion in cancer cells, and CXCL12 in CAFs, linking DYRK1A activity to immunosuppressive paracrine signaling. Conditioned media from DYRK1A-depleted cancer cells or CAFs impaired the migration of monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, indicating that DYRK1A remodels the PDAC secretome to recruit immunosuppressive myeloid populations. These findings extend the established role of DYRK1A beyond cancer cell-intrinsic signaling, highlighting its role as a regulator of secreted factors that shape the PDAC TME, and position this kinase as a potential target to reduce immunosuppressive signaling.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Collagen I promotes cancer cell survival via amino acid import and mTORC1 activation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nazemi, M., Yanes, B., +2 authors, Rainero, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Invasive breast and pancreatic cancer cells thrive within a collagen I-rich, poorly perfused extracellular matrix (ECM) network, necessitating robust metabolic adaptation to endure nutrient deficiency, such as glucose starvation. Here we demonstrate that collagen I is critical for the survival and growth of breast and pancreatic cancer cells, by maintaining their anabolic status. Mechanistically, collagen I promotes 2{beta}1 integrin-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation and drives the membrane localisation of the LAT1-4F2hc amino acid transporter. This process ensures a sustained intracellular essential amino acid supply, further fuelling mTORC1 activity and limiting autophagy. This collagen I-driven pathway is essential for cancer cell survival under nutrient stress, as inhibiting the activity of 2{beta}1 integrin or the LAT1-4F2hc transporter significantly reduces cell growth and invasion in both 2D and 3D models. Finally, the clinical relevance of these transporters is underscored by the significant upregulation of LAT1-4F2hc expression in basal-like breast and pancreatic cancer patients, correlating with poor prognosis and drug resistance. Collectively, our findings highlight that targeting the LAT1-4F2hc transporter might represent a highly promising therapeutic strategy to limit cancer cell growth and invasion in highly fibrotic and nutrient-deprived tumours.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Loss of ESE3/EHF is sufficient to promote cell plasticity, transformation and androgen-independent status in the early stage of prostate carcinogenesis.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Albino, D., Sandrini, G., +14 authors, Carbone, G. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phenotypic plasticity enables tumor progression and treatment resistance. However, its timing and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that cell plasticity can emerge early during prostate cancer development, resulting from the knockout of the epithelial-specific ETS transcription factor EHF in prostate epithelial cells. Inspecting the transcriptome of human prostate cancers, we identified a correlation between low EHF expression, loss of luminal epithelial identity, and attenuated androgen signaling in both primary tumors and castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). In EHF knockout mouse models and human epithelial cells, EHF ablation was sufficient to disrupt epithelial cell lineage integrity and promote a progenitor/stem cell-like state with both basal and luminal features, enabling high plasticity and multi-lineage phenotypic transitions. Mechanistically, EHF acted as a central node controlling a hierarchy of transcriptional regulatory factors and downstream signaling pathways (e.g., COL1A1/DDR1, JAK/STAT3), thereby regulating epithelial lineage integrity and restricting stemness and phenotypic transitions. Activation of these downstream pathways, consequent to EHF loss, promoted non-luminal cell features, attenuated androgenic response, and resistance to AR antagonists. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into the causes of phenotypic plasticity and androgen indifference already at the early stages of prostate tumorigenesis and a new perspective on the paths to cancer progression directly relevant to the development of more efficient treatment strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Increasing TET expression and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation by a carbocyclic 5-aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine antimetabolite</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Däther, M., Peev, E., +15 authors, Carell, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes are critical epigenetic regulators, which oxidize the methylated cytosine nucleobase 5-methyl-dC (5mdC) in the genome to 5-hydroxymethyl-dC (5hmdC) in an -ketoglutarate-dependent manner. Because the presence of 5mdC in the promoter region of a given gene silences its expression, this oxidation goes in hand with the reactivation of such silenced genes. In different highly aggressive cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma, loss of TET enzyme function and therefore reduced 5hmdC levels pave the way for tumor development. Impairment of TET activity can occur through metabolic inhibition, through loss-of-function mutations in TET genes themselves, and finally through suppression of TET-expression via epigenetic silencing. Reactivation of TET enzyme expression represents a major aim of epigenetic cancer therapy. Here we show that the carbocyclic antimetabolite 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (cAzadC), which is supposed to suppress the methylation of DNA during replication, leads to a substantial increase of TET2 expression and strongly increasing 5hmdC levels. We show that the treatment with cAzadC goes in hand with the broad reactivation of the cellular anti-tumor responses. With patient-derived xenograft AML-mouse models, we show that this translates into a strongly improved anti-cancer effect in vivo.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">UHRF1 Overexpression Generates Distinct Senescent States with Different Tp53 Dependencies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Magnani, E., Chen, C., +4 authors, Sadler, K. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Senescence is a pleiotropic phenotype that alternatively suppresses or promotes cancer. The tumor suppressive roles are linked to clearance of damaged cells by the immune system, while cells with tumor promoting functions resist apoptosis, evade immune clearance and either persist and support the tumor microenvironment, or escape and proliferate. What generates these diverse populations is unclear. We investigated this in preneoplastic zebrafish livers where the epigenetic regulator, UHRF1, is overexpressed in hepatocytes. Double strand breaks, DNA methylation repatterning, retrotransposon expression, cell cycle withdrawal and activation of atm and tp53 dependent senescence were early responses to UHRF1 overexpression. This evolved to generate diverse populations of senescent cells, some which expressed immune and senescence signatures plus anti-apoptotic markers, and others co-expressed proliferative genes. The fate of these populations was dictated by UHRF1 levels and Tp53, as Tp53 loss enabled proliferation of cells with reduced UHRF1 expression but not in cells expressing high UHRF1. The senolytic Navitoclax targeted only a subset of senescent cells. Thus, the diversity of senescent cells driven by epigenetic changes can generate divergent outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Heterogeneity of Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients explored through single-cell and single-sample gene regulatory networks.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Leandro Fernandes, Edoardo Saccenti</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, driven by diverse mutations and epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal haematopoiesis. Understanding how this heterogeneity manifests at the gene regulatory level can provide insight into disease mechanisms and uncover potential targets for personalized treatment strategies. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing data from AML patients and healthy controls were used to infer patient gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for progenitor, monocyte, and dendritic cells. Consensus networks were constructed using four inference methods (ARACNE, CLR, MRNET, GENIE3). Additionally, single-sample single-cell networks were constructed using the LIONESS approach for all patients and cell types. Dimensionality reduction applied to both network statistics and adjacency matrices of consensus networks revealed limited clustering, reflecting the biological heterogeneity of AML. Notably, dimensionality reduction and classification models based on single-cell networks achieved distinct patient clustering and perfect discrimination accuracy. This indicates that single-cell GRNs can capture patient-specific signatures of gene regulation. Pathway enrichment analysis of highly connected and predictive genes highlighted distinct regulatory programs across cell types and individuals. These findings demonstrate the potential of GRNs from single-cell data to distinguish between patients and may serve as a foundation for the development of personalized biomarkers and therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">E-ABIN: an explainable module for anomaly detection in biological networks.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ugo Lomoio, Tommaso Mazza, +1 author, Pietro Hiram Guzzi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces. We introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, graph autoencoders, and graph adversarial attributed networks, E-ABIN ensures high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and celiac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms. E-ABIN is freely available on the Zenodo platform at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17062501.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An ensemble-based model comprising deep learning for predicting peptide-binding residues in proteins.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Abel Chandra, Iman Dehzangi, +2 authors, Alok Sharma</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-peptide interactions are fundamental to numerous cellular processes and are linked to diseases like cancer when disrupted. Understanding these interactions is critical for both functional genomics and drug discovery. Despite growing availability of protein-peptide complexes, experimental methods to study them remain resource-intensive and costly. While computational approaches offer a complementary solution, their predictive accuracy is often inadequate. To overcome these limitations, we present PepENS, an ensemble model combining deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques that integrates both structural and sequence-based features from primary protein sequences. By leveraging half-sphere exposure, position-specific scoring matrices from multiple-sequence alignments, and embeddings from a pre-trained protein language model, PepENS demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model demonstrated strong performance, achieving a precision of 0.596 and an AUC of 0.860 on the Dataset 1 test set. On the Dataset 2 test set, it attained a precision of 0.539 and an AUC of 0.846. Notably, these results reflect improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and AUC by 2.8% and 0.5%, respectively, on Dataset 1, and by 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, on Dataset 2. The PepENS software and associated datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28490012.v2.</p>
