<h2 class="paper-title">A funnel-type pipeline for accelerating discovery of tailored designer xylanosomes for efficient arabinoxylan valorization</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fonseca, M. J., Vanderstraeten, J., +2 authors, Briers, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designer cellulosomes (DCs) are synthetic multi-enzyme complexes composed of a scaffold and docked enzymes, engineered for efficient lignocellulose degradation. However, designing these systems is challenged by an expansive design space, low protein yields, instability, and aggregation. To overcome these significant hurdles, we developed a novel, funnel-type methodological pipeline for the parallel construction, production, and analysis of designer xylanosomes (DXs), a subset of DCs targeting hemicellulose's xylan fraction. This streamlined approach leverages VersaTile, a combinatorial DNA assembly technique, to generate an unprecedented number of modular proteins. We demonstrate the efficient construction of 96 bicatalytic dockerin-enzyme (DE) fusions. Parallel high-throughput assays, including Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and DNA Sequencer-Assisted Fluorophore-Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (DSA-FACE), enabled rapid analysis of DE binding efficiencies and substrate preferences, facilitating selection of optimal components for downstream processing. Subsequently, we assembled 23 unique DXs and systematically evaluated their assembly capacity and hydrolytic efficiency. Our findings reveal that DX hydrolytic efficiencies are highly dependent on composition and architecture, yielding either specific arabinoxylan-oligosaccharide (AXOS) mixtures or more complete degradation to monomers. This diversity allows for tailored outcomes, leading to the identification of three superior DX variants. This innovative pipeline significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of highly efficient multi-enzyme complexes, paving the way for more effective biomass valorization processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modular in vivo engineering of the reductive methylaspartate cycles for synthetic CO2 fixation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rainaldi, V., Schulz-Mirbach, H., +4 authors, Claassens, N. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological carbon fixation is currently limited to seven naturally occurring pathways. Synthetic carbon fixation pathways have the potential to surpass aerobic natural pathways in efficiency, but none have been realized in living cells. Here, we present the reductive methylaspartate cycles (rMASP), a novel family of 4 energy-efficient aerobic CO2 fixation pathway variants. These cycles have the potential to outperform the yields and/or rates of the Calvin cycle and previously proposed synthetic CO2 fixation cycles. To realize these designs, we adopted a modular engineering approach in Escherichia coli. Several pathway modules up to a cascade of 11 enzymes were realized via engineering and evolution. We demonstrate crotonyl-CoA carboxylase dependent growth for both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions, and show in vitro activity of the other CO2-fixing 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase, which requires further activity optimization for mesophilic temperatures. This work demonstrates important steps toward realizing efficient synthetic carbon fixation pathways in living organisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">metaboprep v2: Broadening the application of the metaboprep beyond metabolomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sunderland, N., Hughes, D. A., +3 authors, Corbin, L. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-throughput multiplex assays for metabolomics and proteomics offer opportunities for biomarker discovery and disease stratification in epidemiological research. The complexity of these datasets requires robust, standardized and transparent preprocessing workflows to ensure reproducibility and comparability across studies. We present an updated and enhanced version of the metaboprep R package. Originally designed for metabolomics data, it has now been extended to support proteomics datasets from platforms such as Olink(R) and SomaScan(R). This release introduces a user-friendly, modular, object-oriented architecture using R's S7 system, enabling improved input format flexibility, streamlined report generation and increased compatibility with other third-party tools. The updated pipeline is structured in three parts: data import, filtering and summary, and output generation. This structure provides a reproducible yet customizable framework for pre-analysis data preparation with utility across multiple omics platforms and particular value in supporting multi-cohort epidemiological research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SignalGen: A Protein Language Model Based AI Agent For Optimal Signal Peptide Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">McKenzie, J. H., Do, H. N., +2 authors, Gnanakaran, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Signal peptides are short amino acid sequences attached to the N-termini of mature proteins. They play determinant roles in protein expression as well as localization of mature proteins. While sequence-based machine learning (ML) models have been developed to identify the signal peptide sequences given the full or mature protein sequences, no model has been created to design optimal signal peptides with the localization of the mature proteins taken into account. Here, we develop a ML model that considers the mature protein sequence, organism, and localization as inputs, encodes and processes them through a Latent Residual Transformer (LRT), and outputs the optimal signal peptide sequences for enhanced expression of the mature proteins, regardless of whether the proteins are non-native to the organism or de novo. The model is trained using the latest data from the UniProt database up until July 2025. Benchmarking of our ML model shows good performance in predicting the signal peptides for both human and non-human proteins from the UniProt database. Furthermore, our ML model is implemented with an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to enhance accessibility for the general scientific community. Findings from this study provide a framework for predicting optimal signal peptides for non-native protein expression of viral and bacterial vaccine candidates in human cells and for enhanced expression of de novo proteins.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cell Type Specific Inference of Perturbations in Synaptic Communication with MultiNeuronChat</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Volkmer, G., Hjerling-Leffler, J., Bast, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inference of differential neuron-neuron and neuron-glia communication from single nucleus RNA sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover altered communication pathways when comparing groups, such as disease and control, developmental stages, or age groups, or different treatments. Yet, the communication changes are typically not identified on the cell type pair level, limiting its resolution in terms of answering biological and medical questions. Here we present MultiNeuronChat, a highly resolved framework that utilizes gene expression measurements of single cells from case-control single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq data sets together with an existing comprehensive database comprising cell adhesion molecules, gap junctions and synaptic transmission for the differential analysis of neuron-neuron and neuron-glia communication. In an in silico study, we show our method accurately and efficiently predicts known cell type-specific perturbations without summarizing communication scores across donor samples. Using a published single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset, we highlight the sensitivity of our method by showcasing that MultiNeuronChat identifies both known and novel communication pathways in several cell type pairs in Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, we highlight that MultiNeuronChat's donor-specific communication score calculation can be utilized to inform patient stratification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metabolic zonation and characterization of tissue slices with spatial transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Etxezarreta Arrastoa, O., Pirona, A.-C., +1 author, Yosef, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The exchanges of small molecules between cells and their environments are essential for the formation of functioning tissues. To study them at scale, we developed Harreman (Basque for 'receive and give'), an algorithm for identifying metabolic crosstalk from spatially resolved transcriptomics of intact tissues. Unlike previous methods, which primarily focus on the secretion or reception of protein signals, Harreman reconstructs molecular metabolic crosstalk based on the co-localized expression of metabolite transporters. By utilizing a series of increasingly detailed models for testing spatial correlation, Harreman provides insight at multiple levels: a) coarse partition of the tissue into regions sharing metabolic characteristics; b) identification of metabolic exchanges within each region; and c) inference of the cell subsets involved in those exchanges. Harreman identified a sodium/calcium exchange at the tumor boundary in human lung metastases of human renal cancers, and associated it with nearby pro-inflammatory macrophages. In the mouse model of DSS-induced colitis, Harreman identified vitamin A and lysophosphatidylcholine transport at the interface of the epithelial monolayer as major signals associated with regeneration. Harreman is available at https://github.com/YosefLab/Harreman.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Improved marker detection for rare population in single-cell transcriptomics through text mining-inspired scoring approach</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, J., Li, M., +3 authors, Tan, C. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate identification of cell types and states is a crucial step when analysing single cell RNA-seq data. Inaccurate cell type annotation leads to spurious results and biological interpretations in subsequent analyses. Cell type identification is traditionally done using established marker genes of each cell population. However, many existing methods do not perform well for imbalanced cell populations, which often occurs in the presence of rare cell types. Most existing methods tend to be biased towards the dominant cell populations or highly expressed genes, leading to inaccurate results. Here, we introduce the package smartid, which accurately identifies markers from even imbalanced data across batches by employing a modified Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency approach with Gaussian Mixture Model. smartid is also a gene-set scoring method which is able to distinguish the target group of interest. smartid is implemented in R and is freely available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/smartid.html.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Discovery of Inverted Repeats and Palindromes in Viral Genomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sen, M., Rivera, G. M., +2 authors, Ganapathiraju, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An inverted repeat (IR) in DNA is a sequence of nucleotides that is followed by its complementary bases but in reverse order, occurring on the same strand (e.g., TCACCGCGGTGA). If the two complementary sequences occur one after the other without other bases between them, they are referred to as DNA palindromes. IRs could form hairpin and cruciform secondary structures, which endanger genomic stability. They are found to be prevalent in viral DNA at origins of replication, and they play a crucial role in various biological processes including gene silencing, duplication, and genomic evolution. IRs have been less explored, which stems from the scarcity of sequence analysis tools allowing accurate detection on large viral genome data. Here, using the Biological Language Modeling Toolkit (BLMT), we analyzed 14 thousand viral genomes for occurrences of IRs, resulting in the identification of over 19 million IRs longer than 20 bases, including 134 IRs that are 2000 bases long, and around 1,300 IRs per virus.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting Toxicity and Bioactivity of the Chemical Exposome: A Case Study for the Blood Exposome Database</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dutta, A., Barupal, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Humans are exposed to thousands of chemicals throughout their life. Many of these chemicals are detected in blood and have been catalogued in the Blood Exposome Database. Comprehensive hazard assessment of a chemical requires time-consuming and costly lab experiments using animal or cell-lines, which cannot be easily scaled up to the chemical exposome, highlighting the urgent need for computational approaches that can prioritize chemicals based on toxicological information. In this study, we trained direct message passing neural networks (D-MPNN) models using the Chemprop framework chemical structure and bioactivity data from 9,458 compounds profiled in the U.S. EPA Tox21 program across 148 quantitative high-throughput screening assays. Additionally, we trained a complementary model using chemical structures (n=264,601) labeled with known UN GHS classifications for acute oral toxicity. Both models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with average AUCs exceeding 0.80 for 47 Tox21 assays. We applied these 48 models to 58,673 chemicals from the Blood Exposome Database to predict bioactivity and the GHS hazard classification, enabling scalable in-silico prioritization of understudied chemical exposures for further toxicological investigations. Data and code are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17560382 and https://github.com/idslme/exposome-toxicity-prediction .</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Stojanovska, F., Sanchez, R. M., +3 authors, Zaugg, J. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables visualization of macromolecular complexes in their native cellular context, but interpretation remains challenging due to high noise levels, missing information, and lack of ground-truth data. Here, we present CryoSiam (CRYO-electron tomography SIAMese networks), an open-source framework for self-supervised representation learning in cryo-ET. CryoSiam learns hierarchical representations of tomographic data spanning both voxel-level and subtomogram-level information. To train CryoSiam, we generated CryoETSim (CRYO-Electron Tomography SIMulated), a synthetic dataset that systematically models defocus variation, sample thickness, and molecular crowding. CryoSiam trained models transfer directly to experimental data without fine-tuning and support key aspects of cryo-ET data analysis, including tomogram denoising, segmentation of subcellular structures, and macromolecular detection and identification across both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Publicly available pretrained models and the CryoETSim dataset provide a foundation for scalable and automated cryo-ET analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tunneling nanotubes propagate a BMP-dependent preneoplastic state.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">CUELLA MARTIN, C., NGUYEN, T. T., +10 authors, MAGUER-SATTA, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are thin, actin-based structures allowing long-distance communication between cells by promoting the transfer of molecules and organelles. Well-known to contribute to cancer progression, we investigated their role in early tumor initiation using an in - house human breast cell model recapitulating early transformation. We observed that TNTs become more abundant and elongated during this process, and preferentially connect transformed donor cells to non-transformed acceptor cells. We show that this long-range, directional communication involves the transfer of the signaling receptor BMPR1b. Within days, this transfer induces gene expression changes in acceptor cells, consistent with early transformation programs. Functional analyses of these acceptor cells revealed metabolic rewiring and phenotypic changes, including anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, the transferred BMPR1b receptor sensitized acceptor cells to BMP2 signals present in the microenvironment, amplifying their transformation potential. Hence, by tracking the earliest molecular responses in acceptor cells, we deciphered the initial steps of a transformation cascade triggered by TNT-mediated transfer. These findings uncover a BMP-dependent mechanism by which transformed cells propagate a preneoplastic state to adjacent cells at the onset of transformation, offering new perspectives on how epithelial transformation arises and spreads to neighboring cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Repurposing Nelfinavir: AIM2 Inflammasome-Driven Anti-tumor Effects in Glioblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Meena, D., Chhipa, S., +2 authors, Jha, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nelfinavir (NFR), originally developed as an antiretroviral agent for the human immunodeficiency virus, has demonstrated anti-cancer properties across various malignancies; however, its therapeutic potential in Glioblastoma (GBM) remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of NFR in GBM using a comprehensive panel of experimental models, including established GBM cell lines, GBM cell line-derived spheroids, patient-derived primary glioma cells, and patient-derived glioma organoids. We further evaluated the synergistic potential of NFR in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents, Carboplatin and Doxorubicin, across these platforms. In vitro analyses revealed that NFR significantly inhibits GBM cell proliferation and induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Mechanistically, we identified activation of the AIM2 inflammasome as a potential additional pathway mediating the anti-tumor effects of NFR. Collectively, our findings highlight NFR as a promising therapeutic candidate for GBM, exerting its effects through anti-proliferative and pro-death mechanisms potentially linked to AIM2 inflammasome activation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Predictive modeling of flavonoid efficacy against esophageal carcinoma: a comprehensive approach.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Parham Pishro, Jalal A Nasiri, +2 authors, Fatemeh B Rassouli</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Esophageal carcinoma poses a significant health challenge, particularly due to its notably high prevalence in East Asia, which underscores the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. Natural flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds with significant potential to interact with cancer cell pathways; however, their therapeutic application remains constrained by the lack of comprehensive data and consistent experimental evidence. The current study aims to present a comprehensive framework for evaluating the anticancer potential of natural flavonoids, including seven flavones-luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, acacetin, cirsiliol, baicalein and eupatilin-and six flavonols-kaempferol, quercetin, galangin, myricetin, casticin, and gossyptin-against human esophageal carcinoma cells. Extensive experimental data from twenty-two research studies focusing on natural flavonoids and esophageal carcinoma cells were extracted based on specific inclusion criteria that emphasized dose, time, and cell viability. Seven machine learning models-K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, AdaBoost and XGBoost-were employed to predict the optimal dose and time required for flavonoids to achieve 50% cancer cell viability. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned for each algorithm, followed by 5-fold cross-validation on the train dataset to identify the most accurate predictive model. The performance of each algorithm was validated through rigorous hyperparameter optimization and validation on an independent test dataset. The DT model was identified as the most accurate predictor, leading to the development of a simplified model with low complexity that achieved an accuracy of 87.38%. This reliable model enables prediction of effective dosing parameters across diverse esophageal carcinoma cell lines. In conclusion, present study offers a robust yet accessible predictive tool for optimizing treatment strategies against esophageal carcinoma. By combining machine learning with natural compound research, this work exemplifies a transformative approach in oncology, accelerating the development of effective cancer therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A matrix stiffness gene signature identifies SLC20A1 as a novel mechano-immunological checkpoint enabling synergistic immunotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhao C, Lu Y, +2 authors, Yin T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Matrix stiffness is a defining feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and drives malignant progression through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Using an ensemble machine learning approach, we integrated multiomics data from 886 patients with mechano-biology models to develop a nine-gene matrix stiffness-associated gene signature (MSAGS). MSAGS demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy in independent cohorts, outperforming 87 existing signatures. We identified SLC20A1 within MSAGS as a novel mechano-immunological checkpoint where matrix stiffness activates an SLC20A1-STAT3 positive feedback loop, driving dual immunosuppression via TGF-β1-mediated CD8+ T-cell exclusion and PD-L1-induced T-cell dysfunction. Importantly, targeting SLC20A1 synergized with anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta bispecific antibody (BiTP, Y101D), enhancing tumor suppression and extending survival in orthotopic PDAC models by increasing the infiltration and function of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This work establishes MSAGS as a clinically translatable prognostic tool and positions SLC20A1 targeting as a transformative strategy to overcome PDAC immunotherapy resistance, thereby repositioning matrix stiffness as a druggable target.</p>
