<h2 class="paper-title">From Peaks to Patterns</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fathollahian, H., Salahshour, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MRS is a non-invasive method for gathering information about cellular metabolism and can be used to study neurological and metabolic disorders. However, the clinical utility is limited by low signal quality, overlapping spectral peaks, and the inability to interpret and compare metabolite data. We developed an interactive visual analysis system that integrates methods for filtering, quality measurement, and comparative summaries of MRS signals, enabling researchers to more effectively evaluate and interpret spectral data. This will enable researchers to conduct a more accurate evaluation of spectral data, thereby facilitating a deeper understand ing of the molecular processes underlying complex neurological and metabolic processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Billion-Scale Deciphering of Human Gene Regulatory Grammar</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mayne, J., Exposito Rodriguez, M., +2 authors, Goldrick, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting how DNA sequence specifies gene expression remains a core challenge across regulatory genomics. Most predictive assays and models depend on native genomic DNA, constraining the full biochemical engineering space for assessing and designing new sequences. Here, we address this gap with a scalable experimental-computational platform that rapidly generates million-scale sequence-to-expression datasets that directly link degenerate sequences to their function in human cells. We built degenerate libraries of 200-bp promoter cassettes and performed pooled stable integration of up to 1012 unique constructs, enabling the curation of million-scale sequence-to-expression datasets by fluorescently sorting billions of human cells. Biophysical modeling of transcription-factor occupancy on the data using position weight matrices reveals a broad spectrum of correlations between factor abundance and expression levels, with some co-abundances reaching Pearson's r {approx} 0.99, consistent with cooperative and probabilistic regulation. Leveraging the dataset, we trained sequence-to-expression deep learning models that predict held-out expression with Pearson r {approx} 0.4, converge on shared sequence determinants, and agree strongly with each other (Pearson's r = 0.93), indicating reproducible sequence-expression relationships. Finally, with minimal retraining the models generalize to an independently generated dataset collected under distinct sorting conditions, transferring sequence rules across contexts. Our platform enables repeated, rapid studies and supports deeper mechanistic insight while providing baseline models for forward design of human regulatory elements, advancing prediction beyond genomic-DNA-anchored methods.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Assessing the feasibility of machine learning for ancient DNA age prediction: limitations and insights</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kazanskii, M. A., Golikova, M., +3 authors, Uroshlev, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigated the possibility of estimating the age of ancient biological samples directly from their DNA damage profiles using supervised machine learning. Traditional dating methods such as radiocarbon dating, dendrochronology rely on either material context or isotope composition, while our approach exploits intrinsic molecular degradation signatures. Using damage statistics obtained from ancient DNA sequencing data, we trained several regression models to predict sample age over a temporal range of up to 10,000 years. Despite initial correlations between specific damage features and age, cross-validation and external testing revealed no statistically significant predictive signal beyond mean-based baselines. These findings indicate that, in the current formulation, DNA damage information alone is insufficient for reliable age estimation. However, this negative result provides important methodological insight: environmental and biochemical factors appear to dominate damage variation, effectively masking chronological signal. We suggest that integrating contextual data, expanding labeled datasets, and incorporating physical models of DNA decay may improve future attempts. Our study thus contributes to a transparent assessment of the limitations and prospects of DNA-based fossil dating.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Learning the Unseen: Data-Augmented Deep Learning for PTM Discovery with Prosit-PTM</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gabriel, W., Zolg, D. P., +16 authors, Wilhelm, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical regulators of protein function, yet confidently identifying and localizing PTM sites across proteomes remains a challenging task. Integrating peptide property predictions into spectrum interpretation improves identification performance, but training data enabling zero-shot prediction across diverse PTMs are scarce. Here, we present a major expansion of the ProteomeTools dataset, comprising over 977,000 synthetic peptides, covering 22 PTM-residue combinations. Furthermore, we developed Prosit-PTM, a model with chemically-informed encoding and amino acid substitution-based augmentation trained with our novel ground-truth dataset, that achieves accurate zero-shot predictions. Applied to modified peptides, Prosit-PTM enhances PTM-site localization in phosphoproteomics, increases identification of multiply modified peptides in histones, and enables data-driven rescoring for unseen modifications such as HLA peptides. Furthermore, the learned embeddings of amino acids and modifications capture physicochemical relationships underlying PTM-driven HLA presentation. Prosit-PTM is integrated into multiple open-source tools, enabling PTM-aware rescoring, site localization, spectral library generation, and beyond.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SpNeigh: spatial neighborhood and differential expression analysis for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cheng, J., Chow, P. K. H., Liu, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics technologies such as Xenium, MERFISH, and Visium HD enable high-resolution profiling of gene expression while preserving tissue architecture. However, most computational methods for spatial analysis do not explicitly model local tissue context, such as boundaries, neighborhoods, or gradients. Here we present SpNeigh, an R package for spatial neighborhood analysis and spatially-aware differential expression modeling. SpNeigh includes tools for boundary detection, spatial neighborhood extraction, distance-based weighting, and gradient-based statistical testing. It supports both region-based differential expression and smooth spatial modeling using spline-based regression, along with a spatial enrichment index that identifies genes enriched near defined spatial features. We demonstrate the utility of SpNeigh across multiple platforms and tissues, including mouse brain, human breast cancer, and human liver, revealing intermediate populations at tissue interfaces, immune microenvironment differences, and spatially zonated gene expression patterns. SpNeigh offers a flexible and interpretable framework for dissecting spatial gene expression dynamics in complex tissues.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MetaboliteChat: A Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Interactive Metabolite Analysis and Functional Insights</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guo, Z., Duan, D., +2 authors, Xie, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurately characterizing the mechanisms and properties of metabolite molecules is essential for advancing metabolomics and systems biology. Yet most existing approaches are narrow, task-specific models that do not transfer across tasks and cannot express the richer, multimodal biological context of a metabolite in natural language. To address these challenges, we introduce MetaboliteChat, a multimodal ChatGPT-like large language model (LLM) that provides a unified and interactive framework for metabolite analysis. MetaboliteChat integrates molecular-graph and image reasoning with natural language understanding to generate comprehensive, free-form predictions about metabolite mechanisms and properties. The MetaboliteChat architecture consists of a graph neural network (GNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a large language model (LLM), and adapters, all trained end to end. This unified, multimodal design enables interactive reasoning over unseen metabolites, allowing the model to integrate structural and contextual cues and support discovery and translational insights across diverse biological systems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Language may be all omics needs: Harmonizing multimodal data for omics understanding with CellHermes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gao, Y., Wang, W., +8 authors, Liu, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Decoding cellular systems requires integrating diverse omics data, yet most models are trained from scratch on a single modality, restricting generalization. Here we present CellHermes, a biological language model that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to integrate multimodal forms of omics data, such as transcriptomic profile and PPI network, through natural language for better omics understanding. By reformulating these datasets into question-answer pairs, CellHermes emulates multiple self-supervised learning paradigms within a single, universal, language-based framework with LORA fine-tuning on existing natural language-LLM, achieving comparable or even better performance compared to current single-cell foundation models trained from scratch. Within this framework, CellHermes functions as an encoder, a predictor and an explainer for supporting a range of downstream tasks. For encoder, CellHermes encodes biological entities with embeddings that enable accurate network discovery and cross-dataset generalization; For predictor, CellHermes unifies heterogeneous downstream tasks by translating them into natural language question-answers pairs, allowing a single model to perform multi-task prediction by instruction fine-tuning; For explainer, CellHermes explains molecular mechanisms by combining attention analysis with text-based reasoning, leveraging the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We evaluated the ability of CellHermes as an encoder on representing genes and cells using 5 gene-level downstream tasks and 5 diverse single-cell datasets across different tissues compared with other single cell foundation models. We also evaluated CellHermes as a predictor on BioUniBench, a new benchmark of 10 tasks across 7 databases for LLMs, including perturbation response, cell fitness estimation, gene-disease association, and cell type identification. All benchmarks suggest CellHermes can unify multiple biological tasks within one model without compromising performance. By applying CellHermes as an explainer for a melanoma patients dataset, it can uncover potential key genes on tumor-reactive T cells. Together, CellHermes establishes natural language as a unifying medium for omics, offering a foundation that, in the future, potentially enables a more integrated and interpretable research loop of biological representation, prediction, and interpretability.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">HapBridge: A Methylation-Guided Approach for Correcting Switch Errors and Bridging Phased Blocks in Long-Read Phasing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, H., Nie, F., +1 author, Wang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long-read sequencing has substantially advanced haplotype phasing yet continues to face challenges in low-heterozygosity regions and switch errors caused by read noise. DNA methylation exhibits haplotype-specific patterns, providing complementary linkage information, but existing phasing algorithms have not fully leveraged these signals owing to their variability. Here, we present HapBridge, a methylation-guided phasing framework that enhances single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phasing by detecting and correcting switch errors and bridging adjacent phased blocks. Evaluations on Oxford Nanopore R9/R10 and PacBio HiFi datasets show that HapBridge reduces switch errors by 3.07-18.72% and improves N50 length by 5.84-68.61% compared with MethPhaser, achieving higher phasing accuracy and contiguity. These results demonstrate that integrating methylation with sequence variation can provide a robust and intrinsic linkage signal that effectively improves haplotype continuity in long-read sequencing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Designing Convergent Overlapping Genes with Transformer Encoder Models and Lightweight Structural Proxies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Morgan, J. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Overlapping genes allow multiple proteins to be encoded from a single DNA sequence, including convergent (antisense; tail-to-tail) orientations across three reading frames (phases 0, 1, and 2), with phase 1 most frequently observed in nature. Designing such overlaps is challenging due to codon degeneracy, phase-specific biases, and the need to preserve structural integrity for both proteins. Here, a purpose-built transformer encoder is introduced, trained on a balanced synthetic dataset of convergent overlaps spanning diverse prokaryotic genomes and GC contents. Controlled amino acid substitutions were incorporated during training to enhance model generalization, particularly for phase 1 overlaps. At inference, Monte Carlo dropout enabled uncertainty-aware sampling of synonymous codon solutions, which were iteratively refined using a windowed, multi-objective optimization framework. Candidate overlaps were scored using composite weighting across secondary structure preservation, substitution similarity, alignment identity, and ESM-2 contact map similarity, with SSIM applied as a rapid proxy for structural fidelity. This approach generated convergent overlaps across all phases, with phase 1 showing the highest success rates. Optimization trajectories revealed distinct dynamics, with secondary structure preservation steadily increasing despite its lower weight. External validation using SwissProt proteins stratified by AlphaFold2 pLDDT confidence supported generalization to proteins with differing rigidity, yielding high secondary structure preservation in silico. These results demonstrate that transformer models trained directly at the nucleotide level, when coupled with uncertainty-aware inference and lightweight structural proxies, can support the computational design of synthetic overlapping genes without requiring full structural prediction. This framework offers a scalable path for phase-specific, codon-aware overlap design under realistic constraints.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Annotation-Free Prediction of Cancer Cells and Glands and Spatial Analysis of Immune Cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jung, K. J., Ghose, S., +8 authors, Mallick, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prostate cancer is classified as "immune-cold" due to limited infiltration of immune cells and no clear correlation between immune cells and clinical outcomes. However, immune cells are found in prostate cancers and the spatial relationships between these immune cells and cancer cells/glands have not been investigated, partly due to a lack of automated tools that classify both cancerous cells/glands. In this paper, we have developed an end-to-end tool (TOPAZ: Tissue Organization identification using sPAtial proteomics) that combines multiplexed single-cell protein data with histology images to: 1): predict cancerous versus non-cancerous epithelial cells using a Gaussian-mixture model; 2) predict cancerous/non-cancerous gland type using a principal curve estimation. Using TOPAZ to assign cancer and non-cancerous labels to cells and glands, we extracted multiscale spatial features from the classification results--including immune dense-region geometrical features and cell-to-gland distances--and correlated the features with risk of biochemical recurrence and cancer grade. Tissue-microarrays containing 753 cores from 217 prostate cancer patients underwent multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging (Cell DIVE, Leica) for epithelial cell markers (panCK26, S6, NaKATPase), basal cell markers (p63, CK5), a cancer cell marker (AMACR), and T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD68). Cancerous/non-cancerous cell classification from TOPAZ achieved 82% sensitivity and 99% specificity against expert annotation, and the pipeline further predicted cancerous/non-cancerous glands without manual threshold tuning. Regulatory-T-cell and helper-T-cell percentages decreased, and macrophage percentage increased with grade increase (P &lt; 0.05). When the median distance from cancerous gland centroids to the nearest regulatory or helper T-cell exceeded approximately 50 {micro}m, the hazard of biochemical recurrence doubled (log-rank P &lt; 0.01). The open-source Shiny app TOPAZ (https://chunglab.bmi.osumc.edu/TOPAZ) packages the workflow, predicting individual cell types and gland shapes. By combining probabilistic cell typing with gland-shape modeling, TOPAZ yields interpretable multiscale spatial features linked to prognosis and is released as an open web app for unrestricted use.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BUB1B MITOTIC KINASE DRIVES THERAPY RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Martinez, M. J., Blanco, C., +3 authors, Burnstein, K. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that progresses despite treatment with potent AR antagonists such as enzalutamide is a major clinical problem. Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we previously identified a therapeutically relevant seven gene set that drives CRPC. The mitotic checkpoint kinase, BUB1B (BUBR1) is a key member of this gene set, and we report here that BUB1B is a tractable and promising new therapeutic target in aggressive, treatment-resistant PC. We found that high BUB1B expression is correlated with PC progression and aggressiveness. In established CRPC cells, BUB1B depletion blocked cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and mitosis delay. Ectopic expression of BUB1B, at levels found in CRPC, conferred castration-resistant growth of androgen-dependent PC cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that BUB1B kinase activity was essential for CRPC progression, as only wild type (wt) BUB1B and neither of two kinase-dead mutants promoted castration-resistant growth of androgen-dependent PC cells. Rescue experiments with wt or kinase-dead mutants showed further that BUB1B kinase activity was also required to maintain proliferation of established CRPC cells. While persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a mechanism of CRPC progression, BUB1B promotion of CRPC was not dependent on AR as assessed through AR knockdown. Consistent with an AR-bypass mechanism, ectopic expression of BUB1B rendered PC cells resistant to enzalutamide in vitro and in vivo. Our data points to BUB1B as a key driver of CRPC progression and enzalutamide resistance and suggests that targeting BUB1B kinase is a promising therapeutic approach for lethal, treatment-resistant disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Alternate VEGFA isoform expression in fibrosarcoma leads to plasticity in cellular migration and differences in sensitivity to inhibition with anti-VEGFA antibodies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lee, Y.-C., L Aguero Burgos, B., Green, N. H., +1 author, English, W. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metastasis remains a primary contributor to cancer-related mortality. Elevated expression of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoforms is linked to increased metastatic potential and enhanced cellular plasticity in response to microenvironmental changes. To investigate the connection between VEGFA isoform expression, migration plasticity, and metastasis, we analyzed the migratory behavior of fibrosarcoma cells expressing single VEGFA isoforms within engineered microenvironments mimicking tumorassociated extracellular matrix (ECM) architectures that drive distinct migration modes. Fibrosarcoma cell lines expressing VEGFA120 or VEGFA188 were derived from embryonic (Fs120 and Fs188) or mature skin fibroblasts, ensuring comparable VEGFA isoform expression across cells of different origins. Characterization of collagen fibril diameter and organization in tumors derived from Fs120 or Fs188 cells showed that Fs120 tumors had a higher degree of fibril alignment, suggesting VEGFA120 expression may facilitate ECM remodeling to support metastasis. To simulate these different collagen fibril structures for use in migration studies in vitro, we developed 3D platforms representing aligned and randomly organized collagen fibers using electrospinning of polycaprolactone. On 2D surfaces favoring mesenchymal migration and on 3D electrospun scaffolds promoting contact-guided migration, VEGFA120- and VEGFA188-expressing cells exhibited similar migratory capacities, regardless of their origin. However, anti-VEGFA antibodies selectively inhibited the migration of VEGFA120-expressing cells on fibronectincoated surfaces and on aligned fiber scaffolds, but not non-aligned fibers, revealing isoform-specific sensitivity to VEGFA inhibition. In conclusion, while the expression of single VEGFA isoforms does not directly alter migration plasticity, VEGFA120 expression in mouse fibrosarcomas uniquely promotes ECM reorganization in tumors and cells expressing VEGF120 show increased sensitivity to anti-VEGFA antibodies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparison of volumetric dynamic optical coherence tomography with biological methods for evaluation of radiation effects in prostate tumor spheroids</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Swanson, S., Chen, K., +2 authors, Bizheva, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Significance: 3D tumor spheroids are more physiologically representative of in vivo patient tumors compared to 2D monolayer culture. However, their 3D nature challenges the use of conventional biological techniques like proliferation assays, fluorescence microscopy, and the clonogenic assay, which is the gold standard method for assessing cell survival following radiation. However, clonogenic assay requires spheroid disaggregation. Aim: Non-invasive volumetric imaging with dynamic optical coherence tomography (dOCT) enables cellular activity to be visualized with spatial resolution within 3D tumor spheroids. Cellular activity observed via dOCT in irradiated prostate tumor spheroids was quantified for comparison with conventional biological techniques. Approach: A Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator was used to irradiate spheroid and monolayer cultures with a 6 MV beam. Cellular activity was estimated from dOCT images generated via frequency banding and compared to clonogenic assay, proliferation assay, fluorescence microscopy, and 3D cell simulation. Results: Prostate cancer cells cultured as spheroids demonstrated improved radio-resistance via clonogenic assay compared to monolayer culture. The dOCT method demonstrated quantitative and qualitative agreement with proliferation assay and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Conclusions: A longer duration of repeated dOCT measurement in tumor spheroids following radiation treatment could offer a non-invasive alternative to the clonogenic assay.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Star-Motifs: Revealing Single-Cell Spatiotypes from Routine Histology Using Star-Convex Neighborhoods</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gunesli GN, Dawood M, +3 authors, Rajpoot NM.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic interplay among cancer, immune, and stromal cells that profoundly influences tumor growth, progression, and treatment response. Although recent spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging technologies offer fine-grained insights into the TME, their high cost and lengthy turnaround times limit routine clinical use. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) of Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained are readily available for most patients and provide valuable information about tumor biology. Here, we present a method that explicitly models each cell's local neighborhood to identify recurrent spatial patterns, which we call "Star-Motifs." We first encode the local microenvironment of each cell using a "Star-Environment" representation that captures distances and angles to multiple surrounding cell types. We then perform unsupervised clustering of these descriptors to discover distinct Star-Motifs. We validated our method on 1.8 billion cells across 3,105 diagnostic slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas, spanning five distinct cell types: neoplastic, inflammatory, stromal, necrotic, and non-neoplastic. Our method uncovered a diverse range of Star-Motifs, from densely packed tumor clusters to tumor cells surrounded by immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). At the patient level, the relative abundances of these Star-Motifs correlate with patient survival outcomes, immune subtypes, and molecular alterations, offering interpretable, clinically relevant insights. Moreover, classical machine learning models trained on these abundances match or surpass deep learning approaches in predicting overall survival and immune-related biomarkers while remaining interpretable. By capturing higher-order spatial arrangements from routinely available histology slides, Star-Motifs provides a scalable, transparent platform for TME profiling, biomarker discovery, and personalized risk assessment in oncology.</p>
