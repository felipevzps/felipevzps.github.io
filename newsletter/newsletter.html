<h2 class="paper-title">AlterNet: Alternative splicing-aware gene regulatory networkinference</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hoffmann, J., Wallnig, J., +3 authors, Hartebrodt, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) help decode biological systems by identifying how genes interact and regulate cellular processes. However, conventional GRN inference methods operate at the gene-level, overlooking transcript-level variability introduced by alternative splicing (AS). In this work, we present AlterNet, the first GRN inference and annotation pipeline which produces transcript-resolved and AS-aware GRNs. AlterNet builds on the GRNBoost2 inference algorithm, and includes a transcript plausibility and annotation workflow. We applied AlterNet to expression data from heart tissue, including samples from donors with normal heart function and from patients with different types of cardiomyopathy. The resulting isoform-level GRNs uncovered highly relevant regulatory interactions not detectable at the gene-level. Overall, AlterNet infers transcript-level regulatory network which enable the discovery of novel, biologically relevant regulatory interactions that remain hidden in gene-level GRNs. The source code of AlterNet is available on GitHub https://github.com/bionetslab/AlterNet, and can be installed as a Python package.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Billi: Provably Accurate and Scalable Bubble Detection in Pangenome Graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bhat, S. G., Mahajan, D., Jain, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A key application of pangenome graphs is the characterization of small and large genomic variants represented as bubbles within the graph. Although bubbles have been extensively studied in directed graphs in the context of genome assembly, there remains a need for a rigorous definition and systematic analysis of bubbles in bidirected graphs, which is the predominant data structure used to represent pangenomes. We show that existing bubble definitions for bidirected graphs do not fully meet the requirements for representing genetic sites and alleles; in particular, overlapping bubbles may not exhibit strict nesting. To address this, we introduce a new subgraph abstraction called panbubble and prove that it satisfies the desired structural properties for variant characterization. We then present an exact algorithm with runtime O(V^2(V + E)) for detecting all panbubbles in a bidirected graph G = (V, E). In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm that produces identical output as the exact algorithm in practice and scales to large graphs, including both the first and second releases of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC). We implemented our algorithms in the tool Billi (github.com/at-cg/billi). On our largest dataset, Billi is more than 15x faster and uses over 5x less memory than VG.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CCK* (Convex Closure K*): A Suite of Algorithms for the De Novo Design of L- and D-peptide Binders</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Childs, H., McBride, A. C., Donald, B. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The computational design of L-peptides and their mirror-image counterparts, D-peptides, is a valuable area in drug design. L- and D-peptides offer exceptional structural diversity and high binding specificity, while D-peptides additionally confer critical advantages such as proteolytic resistance. Progress in de novo D-peptide design has been hindered by the absence of evolutionary context and limited structural data, both of which are essential for the deep learning methods that dominate L-peptide design. Consequently, any framework capable of designing both L- and D-peptides must not only be grounded in data-driven inference but also first-principles, physics-based modeling. Here, we introduce a unified computational framework that supports de novo design of both L- and D-peptides, thereby expanding the accessible design space across the full mirrored proteome. Convex Closure K* (CCK*) is a suite of chiral-invariant algorithms: SCOPE, MONTAGE, and ARISE. SCOPE, using geometry as a proxy for chemical energetics, computes convex hull representations of rotameric states to rapidly generate multi-sequence protein contacts maps. MONTAGE employs geometric hashing in conjunction with the K* algorithm to generate and rank backbone scaffolds by their suitability for sequence design. ARISE is a sequence design algorithm that uses an iterative residue search approach in an undirected graph to discover high-affinity peptide sequences. We apply the full CCK* suite to six de novo design tasks, benchmarking both homochiral and heterochiral binding on chirality-preserving and chirality-inverting designs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative genomics and interactions of vector thysanopterans and transmitted viruses</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Catto, M. A., Labadie, P. E., +3 authors, Srinivasan, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We analyzed the genomes of nine thysanopteran (thrips) species, with one newly generated, and examined their relationships with 23 representative orthotospoviruses from the family Tospoviridae (order Bunyavirales). Thrips can be agricultural pests, contributing to measurable yield reductions in economically valuable crops and ornamentals. Some thrips species are confirmed orthotospovirus vectors, while most of the ~7,000 identified species are unknown in their vector status. We conducted in silico protein-protein interaction predictions for several thrips proteins, including an endocuticle protein previously reported to bind to orthotospovirus glycoproteins. In most ecologically observed vector-virus pairs, the predicted protein-protein interactions were confirmed, and additional plausible vector-virus transmission interactions emerged from our analyses. These results expand our understanding of vector-virus co-evolution and highlight candidate molecular interfaces that could be targeted to disrupt virus transmission in agricultural systems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bias in genome-wide association test statistics due to omitted interactions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yelmen, B., Güler, M. N., +4 authors, Jay, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Over the past two decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enabled the discovery of thousands of variants associated with many complex human traits. However, conventional GWAS are still widely performed with linear models with the assumption that the genetic effects are predominantly additive. In this work, we investigate the test statistic behavior when linear models are used to obtain significant genotype-phenotype associations without accounting for epistasis. We first algebraically derive mean and variance shift in the null statistic due to the omitted interaction term, and define the boundary between conservative (i.e., deflated statistic tail) and anti-conservative (i.e., inflated statistic tail) regimes for the common GWAS significance threshold. We then perform phenotype simulation analyses using the Estonian Biobank genotypes and validate the mathematical model. We demonstrate that the anti-conservative regime is plausible under realistic parameter settings and models omitting interaction terms can produce spurious significance. Our findings suggest caution when interpreting statistically significant signals reported in the literature based on linear models, especially for large-scale GWAS.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GBoost-CTL: A novel method in multi-tissue transcriptome-wide associations studies in cross-tissue learner incorporating GWAS information</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Billah, M. M., Wei, H., +1 author, Zhang, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous genetic variants linked to complex human diseases, yet linking these variants to transcripts and tissues that drive pathology remains difficult. Multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) offer a powerful bridge, but existing analytical methods have some limitations, either by discarding important signals by separately analyzing and then aggregating results across tissues, implying imputation models in individual tissues, or fusing them with weights that ignore how much GWAS signal each tissue actually carries. Therefore, most of the existing methods do not work uniformly across different GWAS cohorts. Here, we propose GBoost-CTL - a GWAS boosted cross tissue learner that can overcome those aforementioned limitations. The method starts with any collection of single-tissue learners (STLs), allowing investigators to choose the most suitable imputation engine for each tissue. It then (i) allocates weights according to each STLs out of sample predictive accuracy and (ii) refines those weights incorporating the GWAS derived information, so that informative tissues are automatically up weighted while uninformative tissues are down weighted. This dual weighting strategy lets GBoost-CTL adapt to fully shared, partially shared, or highly tissue specific regulatory architectures while preserving nominal type I error control and delivering substantially higher power than existing linear or covariance based methods. Through extensive simulation, we have found that this dual weighting strategy lets GBoost-CTL adapt to fully shared, partially shared, or highly tissue specific regulatory architectures while preserving nominal type I error control and delivering substantially higher power than existing linear or covariance based methods. When applied to real data, GBoost-CTL consistently outperformed some existing multi-tissue TWAS methods (e.g., TWAS-CTL, UTMOST and PrediXcan) by identifying a greater number of disease-associated genes with more stringent p-values. Given its modular design, computational scalability, and demonstrable gains in discovery power, we believe that GBoost-CTL offers a practical tool for the analysis of multi tissue TWAS.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantum and Classical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Protein Ligand Dissociation Constant Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Salamatov, A., Atluri, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> How long a drug stays bound to its target - the residence time - is now recognized as a stronger in vivo efficacy driver than binding affinity alone. Yet current ML models for dissociation kinetics (koff) ignore two critical sources of structure information: (1) the change in protein-ligand geometry across time, and (2) the ability to represent complex spatial interactions with fewer parameters. We extend a state-of-the-art spatial GNN for protein-ligand complexes with two innovations. First, we introduce a 2-timestep GCN+GRU model that learns structure changes before and after short MD simulations. Second, we compress the model head using variational quantum circuits, preserving expressivity while removing ~66% of parameters. On the full PDBbind-koff-2020 benchmark, temporal integration improves predictive accuracy, and quantum compression matches the full classical model's accuracy at a fraction of its size. Our results show that time and quantum structure are underexplored, high-leverage axes for advancing kinetic ML models used in drug design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MIR17HG Expression Is Transcriptionally Regulated by PAX3::FOXO1 and MYCN 1 and is Necessary for Oncogenic Activity in Fusion-Positive Rhabdomyosarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zargar, S. A., Raut, P. K., +3 authors, Barr, F. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), an aggressive pediatric soft tissue cancer, is driven by the oncogenic fusion transcription factor PAX3::FOXO1 (P3F) or PAX7::FOXO1. In a subset of fusion-positive (FP)-RMS cases, amplification of the MIR17HG locus leads to overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, miR-17-92 is also highly expressed in FP-RMS tumors lacking this amplification, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that P3F and MYCN cooperatively drive miR-17-92 expression in FP-RMS. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of P3F or MYCN in FP-RMS cell lines substantially reduced miR-17-92 expression. Using a human myoblast line or low P3F FP-RMS variant with inducible P3F or MYCN expression, P3F or MYCN alone induces minimal to low miR-17-92 expression whereas introduction of both MYCN and P3F leads to robust activation of the miR-17-92 cluster and acquisition of oncogenic phenotypes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed a P3F binding motif located 1.84 Mb upstream of the MIR17HG promoter. CRISPR-mediated deletion of this region in the myoblast system resulted in marked reduction of miR-17-92 expression and impaired oncogenic transformation. Functional inhibition of mature miRNAs of this cluster in FP-RMS cells using miRNA-sponge constructs suppressed proliferation and transformation. In the myoblast model system, transduction studies with exogenous miR-17-92 or miRNA-sponge expression constructs indicated that miR-17-92 is necessary but not sufficient for oncogenic transformation. Together, these findings establish a cooperative transcriptional axis in FP-RMS involving P3F and MYCN that activates MIR17HG through a distal regulatory element, thereby contributing to oncogenic behavior and uncovering a novel mechanistic vulnerability.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Jiang, L., Akpinar, B., +15 authors, Gronlund, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality and is characterized by a high tumor mutational burden, making it responsive to immunotherapy. We developed a bioinformatic and manufacturing pipeline for personalized cancer vaccines and evaluated it in the MC38 colon adenocarcinoma mouse model. Thirty-six high-scoring neoantigens (NAGs) were identified by exome and transcriptome analysis, produced as six purified polypeptides, and coupled to paramagnetic beads. Intralymphatic vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with NAG beads induced robust NAG-specific T cell and antibody responses, resulting in significant inhibition of MC38 tumor growth. Treated tumors displayed increased necrosis and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Compared with soluble peptides, bead-coupled antigens elicited superior protection. Studies in T cell-deficient and antibody-depleted mice confirmed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediated the antitumor effect. These findings highlight the potential of NAG bead vaccination as an effective immunotherapy for CRC.</p>
