<h2 class="paper-title">Label-free detection of individual virus-infected cells using deep learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pfeil, J., Siegmund, C., +11 authors, Koerber, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Numerous applications in research and medicine rely on reliable identification and quantification of virus-infected cells. Current methods either apply reporter viruses, that often differ from clinical isolates (e. g. cell tropism, immune evasion) or staining approaches, that prevent live-cell experiments and may introduce biases through manual counting. We present a deep learning model for the label-free identification of virus-infected cells on light microscopy images (VAIruScope). To overcome limitations, our pipeline enables an automated quantification of virus-infected cells based on the recognition of cytopathic effects. The method was applied to different cell models and four clinically relevant prototype viruses representing RNA- (influenza A virus), DNA- (human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1) and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus-1). VAIruScope identified infected cells achieving classification accuracies of up to 96 %. As proof-of-concept, the method was validated using electron microscopy for a wild-type HSV-1. VAIruScope may be applicable to live-cell imaging to investigate infection dynamics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhancing volumetric microscopy with blind computational correction of spatially variant aberrations using neural field representation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hoang, L., Meyer, D., +2 authors, Yi, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Studying biological processes across multi-millimeter scales requires imaging systems that combine high spatial resolution with a large field of view (FOV). However, optical aberrations degrade image quality, particularly in large-FOV systems where distortions gradually worsen toward the periphery. Existing methods for correcting field-dependent aberrations are limited and often impractical. Hardware-based solutions such as adaptive optics demand additional components and sample manipulation, increasing system complexity and experimental burden. Computational approaches, while promising, typically rely on exhaustive point spread function (PSF) calibration or large training datasets, restricting their applicability. We introduce a self-supervised algorithm that simultaneously estimates spatially varying aberrations and reconstructs 3D sample structure from a single blurred image - without PSF calibration or training data. Our method was implemented on optically cleared mouse hippocampal neurons and cortical vasculature imaged with oblique plane microscopy (OPM), as well as in vivo mouse retinal vasculature captured with adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO), where PSF calibration is infeasible. The algorithm predicts and corrects aberrations across multi-millimeter FOVs, enhances contrast in low signal-to-noise regions, and reveals critical structural details in neuronal and vascular systems that are obscured in raw images. This approach enables high-resolution, large-scale imaging without hardware modifications, expanding the accessibility of advanced microscopy techniques.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DeepSpaceDB 2.0: an interactive spatial transcriptomics database for large-scale Xenium data exploration</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Honcharuk, V., Takemoto, K., +2 authors, Vandenbon, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 10x Genomics Xenium platform enables high-resolution spatial transcriptomics at single-cell and subcellular scales, but effective reuse of public Xenium datasets is hindered by large data sizes and heterogeneous file formats. We previously developed DeepSpaceDB, a spatial transcriptomics database designed for interactive, in-depth analysis of tissues and tissue microenvironments. Here, we present a major expansion of DeepSpaceDB that integrates large-scale single-cell spatial transcriptomics data generated by the Xenium platform. In this update, we systematically collected 628 public Xenium datasets from multiple repositories and processed them through a robust, standardized pipeline that validates, repairs, and harmonizes heterogeneous inputs into a unified representation. To support efficient exploration of these data, we introduced a redesigned DeepSpaceDB interface and complementary Zarr-based storage formats optimized for gene-centric visualization and spatially localized queries, enabling sub-second response times for common interactive operations. The updated platform supports real-time gene expression visualization and region-of-interest analysis directly in the web browser. Together, this expansion establishes DeepSpaceDB as a unified resource for both spot-based and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, substantially lowering the barrier to accessing, exploring, and reusing large-scale public Xenium datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Extending Conformational Ensemble Prediction to Multidomain Proteins and Protein Complex</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhu, J., Bülow, S. v., +2 authors, Chen, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins execute cellular functions through a structural continuum ranging from stable, folded domains to highly dynamic intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Conformational ensembles represent the set of three-dimensional structures a protein adopts under a specific set of conditions, and underlie essential processes from catalysis to complex signaling networks. While deep learning has revolutionized structure prediction, capturing the distinct conformational diversity of folded and disordered regions, especially within multidomain proteins and large assemblies, remains a fundamental challenge. Here we introduce IDPFold2, a generative framework that models the heterogenous protein thermodynamics by integrating a Mixture-of-Experts architecture into the flow matching framework. By routing residues from different regions to specialized expert networks, IDPFold2 accurately predicts conformational ensembles for folded domains, IDRs and multidomain proteins. IDPFold2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in capturing key functional states and fitting the experimental observations across local and global scales. Furthermore, we describe an extension of IDPFold2 to protein assemblies, deciphering the complex binding modes of IDRs within large biomolecular complexes, providing a generalizable tool for exploring the dynamic proteome.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">When CycloneSEQ meets Oxford Nanopore Technologies: a performance comparison of contemporary nanopore DNA sequencing platforms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, X., Ding, Q., +6 authors, Li, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanopore sequencing underpins bacterial genomics and epigenomics, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) leading. We benchmarked BGI's CycloneSEQ against ONT using matched whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and methylation-free whole-genome amplification (WGA) libraries across six bacteria. With the updated CycloneSEQ kit/basecaller, reads reached 96.0% accuracy (mode 97.7%), within 0.8% of ONT R10.4.1; homopolymer performance surpassed R9.4.1 and approached R10.4.1. Error spectra were shared across platforms and dominated by A and G substitutions, WGA controls implicated methylation as a major contributor. At 50-fold coverage plus short-read polishing, CycloneSEQ assemblies achieved around 100% completeness with ~1 indel per 100 Kbp. For epigenomics, strand-specific basecalling errors enabled de novo discovery of 12 methylation motifs, and we introduce two CycloneSEQ-compatible signal-to-reference alignment strategies that permit signal comparison-based methylation detection. Beyond a single instrument, these results argue for a unified, cross-platform nanopore toolchain in which models, formats, and workflows interoperate from raw signal to accurate assemblies and methylomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Empirical-Bayes and Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling forMissingness and Differential Expression in Proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, M., Mallikarjun, V., +2 authors, Trost, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics data often suffer from missing values, especially for low-abundance proteins or when a protein is completely absent in one condition. This makes it challenging to estimate fold changes reliably and perform downstream analyses. Traditional imputation methods often show inconsistent performance across datasets and they typically treat imputed values as fixed rather than uncertain. This can lead to an underestimation of variability in downstream analyses. To address those problems, we present a hierarchical model that accounts for both observed protein intensities and patterns of missing data. Missing values are modelled as left-censored observations below protein-specific detection limits, reflecting the limited sensitivity of the instrument, or being missing with the probability of an intensity dependent manner. Our proposed model captures structure at multiple levels: intensity-level measurements, group-level effects (e.g., experimental conditions), and protein-level variation. To estimate model parameters, we employ an empirical Bayes framework to infer hyperparameters across proteins and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample parameters from the posterior distribution. Our pipeline avoids the need for imputing missing values and is designed to produce more reliable fold-change estimates and uncertainty measures. We benchmark our method against existing approaches and demonstrate that it provides more accurate, stable, and robust estimates for differential expression analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Constructing the ensemble of representative structures for a protein via neural-surrogate-guided MSA recombination</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhou, H., Yu, H., +1 author, Gong, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structural dynamics is essential for the functional and mechanistic illustration of proteins. Previous research attempted to generate diversified protein structures by utilizing the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), but failed to provide physically relevant representative conformations without state annotations. In this work, we propose a framework named ProCEDiS to generate a compact ensemble of representative conformations for the target protein without prior knowledge. Adopting a neural surrogate to assist the exploration of MSA recombination and integrating with AlphaFold2 to model structures, this method can automatically find high-quality, mutually dissimilar conformations for the target sequence. Parallel short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on these structure seeds enable quick while crude free energy estimation, from which physically plausible representative states could be identified. In the benchmark on four protein systems, the ProCEDiS + MD pipeline is capable of providing valuable structural dynamics information within acceptable running time.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatial Regression of Morphology-Protein Coupling in Tumour Proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Leyva, A. G., Niazi, M. K. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein expression within oncogenic or suppresive pathways is hallmark indicator of oncogenesis. While traditional AI models in digital pathology attempt to predict singular proteins, there is a need to predict the downstream expression of proteins to indicate the propagation of signals. RNA-expression provides novel information, but does not provide information about the propagation of protein signals downstream and whether those signals are functional. Using Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data with Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from the publicly available Cancer Genome Atlas' Breast Adenocarcinoma dataset (TCGA-BRCA), we predict the expression of five key proteins identified from the Apoptosis cascade using DNA Damage and Repair Cascades (DDR) as a biological control. Furthermore, we examine the performance of patch level Vision Transformers (ViT) on the regression task, which was tested against the designed Cellular-Level ViT CellRPPA. Our results demonstrate that patch-level vision transformers were unable to obtain statistically significant predictive results, obtaining R squared .1 in all 5 test folds. We also show that morphologically indicative cascades such as the apoptosis cascade provide signficantly higher performance over the DDR cascade.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enabling automatic generation of protein-ligand complex datasets with atomistic detail</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gutermuth, T., Ehmki, E. S. R., +4 authors, Rarey, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting protein-ligand bioactivities is known to be challenging yet crucial in any drug discovery project. In a protein structure-based scenario, supervised machine-learning models have been highly competitive for at least 30 years. Regardless of the machine-learning method used, dataset size and quality are key aspects in model training and validation. In general, datasets are the foundation upon which accurate performance estimates can be obtained. While well-curated repositories exist for bioactivity and protein structure data, combining these two types of data is particularly challenging. With ActivityFinder, we recently introduced a fully-automated process for linking these data sources relying on protein sequence and molecular structure only. By combining ActivityFinder with previously developed tools for structure quality estimation and property calculation, we created StrAcTable, an automatically constructed dataset of annotated protein-ligand complexes. The automated procedure allows for continued and sustainable growth. StrAcTable includes detailed descriptions of the quality of matching between ChEMBL and PDB, of the macromolecular structure, small-molecule ligands bound, and bioactivity data from ChEMBL. Based on ChEMBL Version 35, the StrAcTable contains 20 063 protein-ligand complexes with bioactivity values, enabling an efficient construction of training and validation datasets for structure-based molecular design method development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Convergent Roles of Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) in Mechanotransduction, Vascular Disorganization, and Immune Suppression in Melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, Y.-C., Bollu, V. S., +7 authors, Robertson, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Melanoma, particularly in its advanced forms, remains one of the most lethal skin cancers, with limited effective treatments for both common cutaneous subtypes and rarer variants such as acral melanoma. The effects of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other cancer-cell extrinsic processes on melanoma development remain underexplored. This study identifies Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) as a novel mechanosensing-regulated driver of melanoma pathogenesis across melanoma types. GDF-15 is shown here to be mechanically induced by ECM rigidity and compressive forces occurring during metastatic progression, leading to significantly elevated levels in both cutaneous and acral melanoma cells. In this study, ECM rigidity was recapitulated using cell-adhesive gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel microparticles (microgels) with tunable stiffness, providing a biomimetic platform to investigate how mechanical cues in the tumor microenvironment regulate GDF-15 expression in melanoma. A previously unrecognized synergy between GDF-15 and inflammatory factors commonly present in tumors was identified and found to promote a disorganized, hyperpermeable vasculature, thereby facilitating tumor nutrient access and impeding effective immune cell infiltration. GDF-15 knockdown reduced the intratumoral hemorrhage phenotype, indicating a causal role. GDF-15 also functions by directly suppressing natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, revealing a second cooperating mechanism of immune evasion. These effects position GDF-15 as a key node linking mechanical stress, co-operation with inflammatory factors, abnormal vascular development, and immune dysfunction, thereby converging on a pathways and processes not previously described in melanomas.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Kelly, M. E., Huerta-Uribe, A., +19 authors, FREGAT Working Group</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related death. Although pyrimidine analogue-based neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are widely used, patient responses remain variable. Emerging evidence indicates that bacteria-derived metabolites influence tumor biology and therapy outcomes. To identify non-canonical plasma metabolites linked to cancer biology, we performed correlation analyses between untargeted metabolomics profiles and overall survival. This approach revealed a bacterial metabolite called L-pentahomoserine, or L-2-amino-5-hydroxypentanoic acid (L-2A5HPA), to be positively associated with overall survival. Notably, L-2A5HPA promoted cell survival under nutrient limitation by redirecting glucose metabolism towards aspartate and pyrimidine biosynthesis. In vitro, L-2A5HPA uptake varied among cell lines and was controlled by stereospecific transporters. Furthermore, metabolic profiling in mouse models of liver cancer showed different levels of L-2A5HPA and a strong correlation with pyrimidine intermediates, dihydroorotate and orotate. The link between L-2A5HPA, pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, and cell survival provides mechanistic insight into its association with patient outcome. Our findings position L-2A5HPA as a metabolite with potential to become a prognostic biomarker for EAC and underscores its role in metabolic adaptation under nutrient-deprived conditions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The FANCM-RMI1/2 complex promotes genomic instability and PARP inhibitor sensitivity in BRCA2-deficicient cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dossin, F., Attia, M., +8 authors, Deriano, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer cells lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2 must adapt to survive and proliferate despite defective DNA repair and high genomic instability. Restoration of homologous recombination (HR) through loss of DNA end protection rescues growth defects and promotes PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells; however, the genetic basis of adaptation to BRCA2 loss remains largely unexplored. To delineate BRCA1- and BRCA2-specific adaptation trajectories, we established a fully isogenic screening platform in mouse embryonic stem cells engineered for acute depletion of either protein. This approach uncovered hundreds of genes with shared, distinct, or even opposing effects between the two BRCA-deficiency states. We identified FANCM and its interacting partners RMI1/2, CENPS/MHF1, CENPX/MHF2, and FAAP24 as essential in BRCA1-deficient cells but toxic in BRCA2- deficient contexts. Loss of FANCM in BRCA2-deficient cells alleviated genomic instability and proliferation defects by preventing RMI1/2-dependent replication fork degradation, without rescuing HR. Moreover, we show that the FANCM-RMI1/2 complex drives PARPi sensitivity in both mouse and human BRCA2-deficient cells, in contrast to the 53BP1-SHLD-CST axis in BRCA1-deficient cells. These findings reveal distinct adaptation routes to BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss and establish FANCM as a determinant of BRCA2-specific vulnerability and therapeutic response, with direct implications for tailoring prevention and therapy according to BRCA mutation status.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metabolic plasticity of sphingolipids governs cancer cell fitness in acidic tumor ecosystems</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chalar, R., Khatri, N., +13 authors, Damaghi, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer cells must adapt to harsh tumor microenvironments, including acidic stress, to survive and thrive. Understanding how cancer cells achieve this adaptation can uncover new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the spatial metabolic phenotypic heterogeneity of breast cancer cells in acidic habitats using spatial multi-omics approaches on 3D spheroids. We found cancer cells dynamically regulate sphingolipid metabolism to fine-tune their cell state to cope with acidic selection pressures. Cancer cells evolve mechanisms to deal with initially accumulating toxic ceramides but later adapt to it by rerouting SL metabolic pathways to eliminate them. Using advanced MALDI image analysis, and SL inhibitors on patient derived organoids, we demonstrated that cancer cells can switch between metabolic routes when key pathways are blocked, showcasing remarkable cell state plasticity. These insights highlight the potential to target metabolic plasticity as a novel therapeutic strategy to disrupt cancer adaptation and evolution, offering new avenues for cancer treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bifurcation Analysis of Cancer-Immunity Cycle</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yoon, N., Scott, J. G., Cho, Y.-B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite advances in cancer immunotherapy, many patients still develop immune escape and disease progression. Understanding the dynamical mechanisms underlying the transition between tumor control and immune escape is therefore critical. Bifurcation theory offers valuable insights into how gradual changes in system parameters can lead to sudden qualitative shifts in dynamic behavior. In biological contexts such as cancer-immune interactions, these shifts can mark critical thresholds between tumor control by immunotherapy and uncontrollable progression. This study reviews bifurcation analysis for systems of difference equations, and demonstrates an application in immunotherapy of cancer. We apply the method of eigenvalues and Jacobian matrices to a previously developed model of the cancer-immunity cycle. This model examines how varying levels of immune suppression (related to PD-1-mediated immune evasion) affect system behavior. Along with a saddle-node bifurcation which is relatively more straightforward, the model reveals a stability bifurcation which depicts a transient stable equilibrium that appears (immune-limited state) and then disappears (immune-escape state). Since the potential to control cancer to a finite size depends on the existence of a stable equilibrium, understanding how to adjust immune reaction could be a game changer in immunotherapy. This framework therefore provides a mathematical basis for adaptive immunotherapy, in which treatment intensity is adjusted dynamically in response to evolving tumor-immune interactions. The stability bifurcation does not always coincide with the saddle-node bifurcation, instead it can occur at a lower immune suppression value (called an "early bifurcation"). Our case studies reveals that an early bifurcation arises only under a strong immune condition, whereas both bifurcations occur coincidentally under a weak immune condition. This discrepancy implies that relying only on the criterion with the saddle-node bifurcation may lead to an overestimate an immunotherapy effect under a strong immune environment. These results provide insight into the treatment strategy of anti-PD-1 based medicine. Along with the analysis of the immune suppression parameter, additional parameter analyses highlight that both the existence and stability of equilibria are highly sensitive near stability classification boundaries. Overall, this refined analysis strengthens the mathematical basis for modeling tumor-immune dynamics and may help optimize immuno-therapeutic strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Identification of Antiviral Peptides Using Various Encoded Features.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hasan MZ, Shakil MS, +8 authors, Moni MA.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Viruses are a significant threat to human life, as demonstrated by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the Ebola outbreak. Diseases such as smallpox, AIDS, hepatitis, liver cancer, and cervical cancer often caused by the Human Papillomavirus can lead to fatal outcomes. Over the years, extensive research has focused on developing vaccines and antiviral drugs, which have successfully contained and, in some cases, eradicated viral infections. Recently, computational techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms, have made notable progress in identifying potential Antiviral Peptides (AVPs), thereby accelerating experimental validation for therapeutic applications. This study introduces machine learning techniques and a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model combined with three feature-encoding methods to predict whether a protein sequence contains effective antiviral peptides. Eight machine learning algorithms were evaluated using both single-feature and combined feature encodings. Among them, the lightweight LGBM model trained on combined encoded features achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 97%, recall of 98%, F1-score of 98%, and an AUC of 1.00. Compared to existing models, the proposed approach achieved approximately 2% higher accuracy using individual encoding methods and about 3% higher accuracy with combined features. The reliability and effectiveness of the proposed model highlight its potential value for pharmaceutical development and academic research.</p>
