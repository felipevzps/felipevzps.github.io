<h2 class="paper-title">Structure and evolution-guided design of minimal RNA-guided nucleases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Skopintsev, P., Esain-Garcia, I., +17 authors, Doudna, J. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The design of RNA-guided nucleases with properties not limited by evolution can expand programmable genome editing capabilities. However, generating diverse multi-domain proteins with robust enzymatic properties remains challenging. Here we use an artificial intelligence-driven strategy that couples structure-guided inverse protein folding with evolution-informed residue constraints to generate active, divergent variants of TnpB, a minimal CRISPR-Cas12-like nuclease. High-throughput functional screening of AI-generated variants yielded editors that retained or exceeded wild-type activity in bacterial, plant and human cells. Cryo-EM-based structure determination of the most divergent active variant revealed new stabilizing contacts in the RNA/DNA interfaces across conformational states, demonstrating the design potential of this approach. Together these results establish a strategy for creating non-natural RNA-guided nucleases and conformationally active nucleic acid binders, enlarging the designable protein space.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">From features to slice: parameter-cloud modeling of spatial transcriptomics for simulation and 3D interpolatory augmentation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, Y., Xie, M., +5 authors, Zhou, X. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational simulation and data augmentation of spatial transcriptomics (ST) are essential for quantitative benchmarking, reproducibility, and methodological innovation. Yet current models often lack flexibility in controlling spatial and transcriptional heterogeneity, fail to capture higher-order gene dependencies, and rarely extend to three-dimensional or alignment-aware contexts. Here we present FEAST, a computational infrastructure that models ST data within a parameter cloud - a latent manifold encoding gene-level mean, variance, and sparsity. By sampling and perturbing this manifold, FEAST generates high-fidelity synthetic slices with tunable spatial and transcriptional variation, enabling systematic evaluation of clustering, deconvolution, and spatial alignment algorithms. Beyond two dimensions, FEAST performs 3D parameter-cloud interpolation guided by optimal transport and benchmark alignment, reconstructing continuous tissue architectures while preserving molecular coherence. Together, these capabilities establish FEAST as a foundational platform for standardized benchmarking, data augmentation, and 3D reconstruction in spatial transcriptomics. The source code and tutorials for FEAST are publicly available at https://github.com/maiziezhoulab/FEAST, and can be installed via Pypi at https://pypi.org/project/FEAST-py.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CORAL: Accurate annotation of compact genomes using long-read RNA-seq, demonstrated in Oikopleura dioica</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Torres-Aguila, N. P., Cassa, B., Canestro, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The burst of high-quality genome assemblies has created an urgent need to improving genome annotation tools, especially for problematic species such as those with compact, fast-evolving genomes in which standard annotation tools underperform when facing short intergenic regions, overlapping UTRs, non-canonical splicing and widespread operons. We present CORAL (Compact-genome Oriented RNA-based Annotation using Long-reads), a long-read RNA-seq-based workflow for de novo annotation of compact eukaryotic genomes, together with GAMBA (Gene Aggregation tool for Multicistronic Block Annotation), a Rust-based module that detects polycistronic transcriptional units directly from GTF annotations and is integrated within CORAL. Using the exceptionally compact chordate genome of Oikopleura dioica as a case study, CORAL increases the number of annotated genes, improves gene-model completeness and reduces chimeric predictions relative to existing annotations, while GAMBA recovers thousands of operons, most of which are independently supported by splice-leader data. Together, CORAL and GAMBA provide an accurate, scalable framework for annotating compact, structurally atypical genomes using long-read transcriptomic data alone. Availability and Implementation: CORAL and GAMBA are open source and available at https://github.com/EvoDevoGenomics-UB/CORAL and https://github.com/nurie05/gamba-tool.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Structural Analysis of Recombinant AAV Vector Genomes at Single-Molecule Resolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rouleau, D., Lata, D., +4 authors, Iwuchukwu, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors are essential tools for in vivo gene therapy, yet heterogeneity in their packaged genomes remains an important safety consideration. To systematically evaluate this heterogeneity, we developed a long-read, read-level analysis pipeline that directly classifies individual AAV genomes and their structural variants from PacBio sequencing data. The workflow combines two components: a tiling step that aligns each read to reference sequences to generate positional patterns, and a parsing step that applies a formal grammar to categorize reads into five structural classes: expected, truncated, snapback, truncated snapback, and others. Each molecule is annotated with strand orientation, breakpoint coordinates, and structural arrangement, enabling precise classification of genome heterogeneity at single-vector resolution. Applied to both single-stranded and self-complementary vector genome preparations, the pipeline achieved high classification accuracy and revealed distinct patterns of genome structure between different vector constructs. In both cases, the majority of genomes were classified as expected full-length species, consistent with the dominant full peaks observed by orthogonal methods. For snapback genomes, breakpoints frequently clustered at discrete sites, with some coinciding with regions predicted to form stable secondary structures and others occurring in less structured regions. This distribution suggests contributions from both sequence-driven folding and additional replication- or processing-related mechanisms. Together, these read-level insights highlight sequence and structural features that shape AAV genome heterogeneity. Importantly, the pipeline demonstrated strong performance in structural classification, maintaining high accuracy even in the presence of sequencing error profiles such as homopolymer-associated indels (insertion or deletion). By integrating structural classification, sequence context, and secondary-structure predictions, our pipeline provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating recombinant adeno-associated virus genome diversity. This approach not only improves resolution of vector genome architecture but also offers actionable insights to guide vector design and production processes for safer and more efficacious recombinant adeno-associated virus therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Analyzing associations and higher-order effects in multi-omics data with double machine learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hecker, J., Prokopenko, D., +3 authors, Lange, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Integrative omics analyses enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and biomarkers by investigating relationships among traits, omics measurements, genetic variants, and epidemiological factors. Statistically, these analyses are challenging and require robust, flexible methodologies due to high dimensionality, non-standard data distributions, and potentially complex, non-linear confounding effects. Results: To facilitate the integration and analysis of multi-omics data, we introduce the Robust Omics MethodologY (ROMY) framework and its corresponding R implementation, the romy package. ROMY enables users to (a) perform robust association testing between two target variables while incorporating flexible covariate adjustments, (b) examine effects on measurement variances and covariances (e.g., co-expression, co-abundance), and (c) conduct rigorous interaction-effect testing. ROMY builds on recent advances in theoretical statistics and double machine learning to ensure robustness and statistical validity. We illustrate the performance of our framework through simulation studies. Availability and implementation: romy is an R package available under the GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub: https://github.com/julianhecker/romy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Conjugation Based CRISPR Antifungals (COBRA)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nasrollahi, V., Karas, B. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fungal infections are increasingly difficult to treat due to rising antifungal resistance and the limited number of effective drug classes. To address this challenge, we developed a conjugation-based CRISPR antifungal (COBRA) platform that enables delivery of programmable gene-targeting machinery from Escherichia coli to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a mobilizable pVenom plasmids containing an oriT for conjugation, Cas9 and guide RNAs for elimination of yeast. To prevent toxicity in E. coli, yeast ACT1 intron is inserted in Cas9. Seven guide RNAs targeting essential genes involved in cell cycle progression, ribosome function, and DNA replication were first assessed by using electroporation as delivery and demonstrated strong lethality for guides targeting CDC28 and MCM2. When delivered by conjugation, these guides again reproduced these results, whereas an intron-targeting control remained non-lethal. Dual-guide plasmids eliminated yeast colony formation entirely. Together, these findings demonstrate that conjugation-delivered CRISPR machinery can successfully target endogenous fungal genes and, especially when multiplexed, offers an effective and programmable antifungal strategy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Elucidation and engineering of arabinofuranosyltransferase to enable total de novo biosynthesis of paris saponins in yeast</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, H., Yang, Y., +9 authors, Zhang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Paris saponins (PSs) are structurally complex steroidal saponins that, due to their diverse glycosylation patterns, exhibit a range of significant pharmacological activities, including anti-tumor and antibacterial effects. However, incomplete characterization of the key enzymes responsible for glycosylation modifications has hindered their efficient heterologous biosynthesis. In this study, we reprogrammed the sugar donor specificity of a steroidal rhamnosyltransferase (UGT93M3) to enable the transfer of arabinofuranose (Araf). Through structural analysis, we identified key amino acid residues (368H/Q) that play an important role in determining Araf donor specificity. Guided by this insight, we successfully reconstructed the paris saponin (PS) biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using engineered enzymes. To address challenges related to donor availability, we introduced UDP-sugar biosynthetic modules (UDP-Rha and UDP-Araf) into yeast. With this integrated platform, we were able to de novo produce a range of paris saponins, including diosgenin-3-O-glucosyl-(1[-&gt;]6)-glucoside (DGG), diosgenin-3-O-rhamnosyl(1[-&gt;]2) [glucosyl(1[-&gt;]6)]glucoside (DRGG) and paris saponin . This work establishes a novel microbial platform for the sustainable production of paris saponins, particularly PS, advancing the biosynthesis of steroidal glycosides and providing a potential strategy for the industrial-scale production of bioactive saponins.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of Patient Trajectories in Timeseries Clinical Transcriptomics Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mathur, S., Chen, Y., +2 authors, Habiel, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In clinical trials, it is common for only a subset of patients to respond to a given therapy. Such variability may arise from genetic differences, environmental influences, or the presence of distinct disease endotypes. Longitudinal transcriptomic profiles collected in phase 2a/2b studies provide a unique opportunity not only to investigate drug-induced biological mechanisms in humans, but also to understand why certain individuals fail to respond and to uncover previously unrecognized disease endotypes, ultimately informing the development of targeted therapeutics. However, analyzing these datasets is challenged by substantial patient heterogeneity, variability in disease severity at each visit, and the coarse temporal resolution due to sparse sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a classification-guided autoencoder framework that jointly optimizes gene-expression reconstruction and classification objective to learn disease-relevant sample embeddings. Sample embeddings from all patients are leveraged to establish a continuous representation of disease dynamics, which can be clustered to delineate discrete disease states. We then construct a patient-sample graph in the learned latent space and apply a multi-commodity-flow based algorithm to infer patient trajectories through these states, enabling the identification of different patient trajectories. We evaluated our approach on three interventional datasets - ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, each containing both responders and non-responders. The method recapitulates known pathway perturbations associated with anti-IL17 and anti-IL6 therapies, identifies intermediate states reflecting disease/treatment progression, and reveals biologically meaningful patient trajectories within the patient population.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A FAIR Amplicon Sequencing Workflow for Long-term Environmental Monitoring</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Harmel, M., Durieu, B., +5 authors, Cornet, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antarctica represents one of the last pristine environments on Earth, providing a unique opportunity to to study the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Ice-free areas, such as the inland nunataks of the Sor Rondane Mountains (SRM), host unique terrestrial and lacustrine ecosystems, of which the simplified food webs rely almost exclusively on microbial primary production. Because of their small size, low productivity and hence low biomass, these microbial communities are fragile. Seven SRM sites were selected to be part of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 179. The MonASPA project has established an environmental monitoring program to evaluate the effectiveness of the management plan approved by the Antarctic Treaty System for these areas. A key component of MonASPA is the long-term monitoring of microbial biodiversity using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. To ensure consistent operation over decades, we developed the Reproducible Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline for Antarctic Monitoring (RASPAM), which is built on Apptainer containers and Nextflow workflows. RASPAM implements Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) and Zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs) to provide high-resolution taxonomic affiliation. It incorporates, in addition to the SILVA database, a taxonomically curated 16S rRNA database for cyanobacteria and enables comparisons against NCBI databases to facilitate the identification of rare prokaryotic strains in environmental samples. RASPAM is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) and represents a robust tool for long-term monitoring of microbial communities in Antarctic and other extreme environments.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A single-nucleus multimodal framework reveals epigenomic priming of chemoresistant states in ovarian cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Landais, Y., Bertorello, J., +19 authors, Vallot, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-genetic intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) drives therapeutic failure in cancer, yet its clinical monitoring remains challenging. We develop a multimodal single-nucleus framework that simultaneously profiles transcriptional and histone modification landscapes from frozen biopsies. Applied to longitudinal samples from 16 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), this approach reveals reproducible tumor evolution under chemotherapy: proliferative and interferon-responsive states are lost, while those associated with TNFalpha and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) expand. Chromatin profiling shows that these chemoresistant programs are epigenetically primed through H3K4me1 marks before treatment and nominates transcription-factor drivers, including ZBTB7A. Non-genetic baseline tumor composition predicts survival, and fibroblast remodeling parallels malignant adaptation. These findings establish a clinically scalable strategy for mapping functional ITH and identify epigenomic priming as a determinant of therapeutic failure.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MSC-delivered High-Affinity Variants of soluble PD1 lead to tumour regression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mohr, A., Zwacka, R. M., +5 authors, Rushworth, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune checkpoint therapies aim to restore anti-tumour immunity by blocking inhibitory signals that suppress T-cell activation. The most effective current strategies use humanised antibodies targeting PD1 or its ligand PDL1. However, due to their large size, antibodies often exhibit limited tissue diffusion, resulting in poor penetration into solid tumours. To address this challenge, we developed a novel checkpoint inhibitor approach that uses mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to deliver a high-affinity, soluble PD1 receptor (sPD1HAC). We found that sPD1HAC produced as an IgG1-Fc fusion protein provided functional expression in MSCs. The sPD1HAC-IgG1-Fc fusion protein showed strong and specific binding to PDL1 and could outcompete recombinant PD1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies, including the clinically approved durvalumab. Although the sPD1HAC variant was designed to block human PD1-PDL1 signalling, it also bound murine PDL1 and blocked the binding of mouse-specific PD1 antibodies as well as recombinant murine PD1 protein. Accordingly, we found significant anti-tumour activity of intravenously administered MSCs.PD1HAC in an aggressive B16-F10 cancer model. This cell-based immune checkpoint approach offers a potential therapeutic option for targeting stroma-rich, treatment-resistant tumours.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting CREB remodels the immune microenvironment to enhance immunotherapy responses in pancreatic cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mehra, S., Srinivasan, S., +19 authors, Nagathihalli, N. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a challenging disease in need of improved treatments. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein 1 (CREB) is an emerging therapeutic target whose oncogenic effects in PDAC have been largely attributed to a key molecular interplay between oncogenic KrasG12D/+ (Kras*) and chronic inflammation driving irreversible acinar to ductal reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that CREB activation fosters tumor associated macrophage (TAM) mediated immunosuppression and promotes PDAC growth in an aggressive LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+;Pdx1Cre/+ (KPC) genetically engineered mouse model. Selective deletion of CREB (Crebfl/fl) in KPC (KPCC-/-) mice attenuates primary disease burden. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis and validation using diverse molecular, genetic and pharmacological approaches in vitro and in vivo identify CREB-mediated transcriptional regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) as one of the potential mediators of tumor cell-macrophage crosstalk promoting a pro-tumor polarization of TAMs, thereby attenuating the infiltration of effector T cells. Mechanistically, cancer cell derived LIF facilitates an immunosuppressive, pro-tumorigenic state. Importantly, pharmacological targeting of the CREB-LIF signaling axis between cancer cells and macrophages, using a CREB-inhibitor (CREBi), significantly suppresses tumor growth and sensitizes PDAC to immunotherapy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this treatment combination to improve outcomes in this aggressive disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting ALC1 can safely expand the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors across high-grade serous ovarian cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Verma, P., Aubuchon, L. N., +11 authors, Mullen, M. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are approved for homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), but their long-term effectiveness is limited by the emergence of resistance and hematological toxicity. Approximately 50% of HGSOCs are homologous recombination-proficient (HRP), and within this group, about 20% harbor CCNE1 amplification (cyclin E1-high). PARPi are especially ineffective in HRP tumors and in CCNE1-high HGSOCs, which represent a major unmet clinical need. Loss of a chromatin remodeling enzyme, Amplified in Liver Cancer 1, ALC1, has been shown to enhance PARPi sensitivity. However, the clinical contexts in which ALC1 targeting will be clinically meaningful remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ALC1 loss can enhance PARPi sensitivity across HRD and cyclin E1-high serous ovarian cancer lines, xenografts and patient-derived cells. ALC1 depletion can overcome several clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance, though its impact is limited in tumors with complete restoration of HR. Lower ALC1 expression correlates with longer progression-free survival and extended PARPi response. Importantly, ALC1 loss has minimal effects in BRCA-wild-type or BRCA-heterozygous non-cancerous fallopian tube cells, suggesting therapeutic safety. Increased PARPi sensitivity following ALC1 loss can be accurately predicted by endogenous single-stranded DNA levels, identifying a functional biomarker. Together, our studies define the clinical contexts in which the therapeutic utility of PARPi can be expanded by targeting ALC1, whose inhibitors are currently under evaluation in Phase I clinical trials.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dual inhibition of the nonsense mediated mRNA decay enhances tumour immunogenicity, drives immunoediting, and potentiates checkpoint blockade</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Janic, A., Zadra, I., +10 authors, Supek, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune checkpoint blockade has transformed cancer therapy, but current biomarkers such as tumour mutation burden often fail to reliably predict clinical benefit. One proposed reason for this discrepancy is the activity of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular quality-control pathway that degrades mutant transcripts, potentially reducing the presentation of neoantigens that would otherwise stimulate anti-tumour immunity. To address this, we identified publicly available small-molecule inhibitors targeting the NMD factors SMG5 and SMG7 (NMDi), which we have prioritise as the NMD components most strongly associated with NMD efficiency across TCGA tumours, and evaluated their therapeutic potential in vivo. In a syngeneic, DNA repair deficient mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, NMDi treatment alone substantially reduced tumour burden, and its combination with anti PD1 therapy led to additive benefit either treatment alone. These effects were immune-dependent and specifically required CD8 T cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell analyses revealed that NMDi reprograms the tumour immune microenvironment, enriching for clonally expanded, cytotoxic CD8 T cells and altering macrophage states toward those associated with tumour regression. Whole-genome sequencing of tumours revealed that NMDi also promotes immunoediting, leading to negative selection against immunogenic mutations and coding indels, with selective pressure comparable to or greater than that induced by anti PD1 treatment. Guided by these results, we generated a new protein language model trained on tumour mutations that can identify neopeptides with immunogenic properties, revealing that the NMDi tumour landscape provides a rich genomic and immunopeptidomic setting for exposing neoantigens that evade immunoediting. Together, these pre-clinical and integrative genomic-transcriptomic insights position NMD inhibition as a promising immunostimulatory strategy that can potentiate immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in tumours.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Precise diagnosis of small invasive pulmonary nodules driven by single-cell immune signatures in peripheral blood.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang Xia, Yin Zhu, +15 authors, Wen Li</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes. However, accurately diagnosing invasive pulmonary nodules and predicting tumor invasiveness remain major clinical challenges. Given the established role of immune dysfunction in cancer development, we hypothesize that peripheral immune profiling could provide a strategy for managing pulmonary nodules. In this multi-center, prospective study, we combine peripheral immune profiling via mass cytometry with machine learning algorithms to develop an integrated pulmonary nodule management platform. This platform accurately distinguishes invasive from non-invasive pulmonary nodules (AUC = 0.952), outperforming established clinical and radiomics-based models. Furthermore, it effectively predicts tumor invasiveness, differentiating minimally invasive from invasive adenocarcinoma (AUC = 0.949), thereby offering valuable guidance for surgical decision-making. In conclusion, the platform demonstrates substantial clinical utility and holds significant promise as a precision tool for future management of pulmonary nodules.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The IGVF catalog-from genetic variation to function.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Daofeng Li, Shane Liu, +43 authors, Ting Wang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genomic variation between individuals is essential for understanding how differences in the genome sequence affect molecular and cellular processes. The Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium aims to uncover the relationships among genomic variation, genome function, and phenotypes by combining experimental techniques, such as single-cell mapping and genomic perturbation assays, with computational approaches such as machine learning-based predictive modeling. The IGVF Data and Administrative Coordinating Centers collect, analyze, and disseminate data and results from across the consortium through an open-source platform called the IGVF Catalog. This resource includes, but is not limited to, data on the effects of coding variants on protein abundance and function, noncoding variants on enhancer activity (measured by MPRA or predicted computationally), and associations between variants and quantitative traits. All data are organized within a graph database comprising over 50 types of data collections with nearly 3 billion nodes and over 7.5 billion edges. The Catalog offers public API endpoints (https://api.catalogkg.igvf.org/) and a user-friendly interface for exploring, querying, and visualizing the data at https://catalog.igvf.org. We expect that this open-access platform will support the broader scientific community to advance our understanding of how genomic variation influences biology and disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Functional NK engagers from OmniClic, a common light-chain platform producing fully human-sequence antibodies in a chicken host species.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zeng B, Mechin I, +7 authors, Abdiche Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Next-generation antibodies include a growing number of bispecific and multispecific antibodies that are commonly used to redirect the immune system to fight cancer. Herein, we assessed the depth and breadth of epitope coverage as a proxy for functional diversity in human immune repertoires produced by two complementary in vivo platforms utilizing a common light chain, in a chicken (OmniClicTM) or rat (OmniFlic®) host species. We adopted NKp46 as a model to target antigen due to its use in emerging natural killer (NK) immune engagers that are being explored clinically as potentially safer alternatives to traditional CD3-based T cell engagers. To probe the epitope diversity of our antibody repertoires, we performed a detailed high throughput epitope binning study using surface plasmon resonance and corroborated our binning assignments with epitope mapping data deduced from hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Our results revealed broad epitope coverage and nuanced diversity both within and across repertoires, with few epitopes shared, suggesting that the complementary use of OmniClicTM and OmniFlic® produces more comprehensive coverage than either alone. Furthermore, our epitope binning assignments aligned with our complementarity-determining region-based sequence lineage assignments, enabling a direct comparison of sequence diversity across Clic and Flic repertoires despite their use of different scaffolds, a single functionally rearranged V(D)J scaffold versus multiple combinatorially assembled V(D)J scaffolds, respectively. The rich epitope diversity of both OmniClicTM and OmniFlic® yielded multiple candidates for functional NK activators, as determined in an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay, demonstrating their value as building blocks in constructing optimized immune engagers.</p>
