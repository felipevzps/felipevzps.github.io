<h2 class="paper-title">BESTish: A Diffusion-Approximation Framework for Inferring Selection and Mutation in Clonal Hematopoiesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, R.-Y., Dinh, K. N., +3 authors, Kimmel, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) arises when hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a fitness advantage from somatic mutations and expand, resulting in an increase in variant allele frequency (VAF) over time. To analyze CH trajectories, we develop a state-dependent stochastic model of wild-type and mutant HSCs, in which an environmental parameter in [0,1] regulates death rates and interpolates between homeostatic (Moran-like, = 1) and growth-facilitating ( &lt; 1) regimes. Using functional law of large numbers and central limit theorems, we derive explicit mean-field dynamics and a Gaussian-Markov approximation for VAF fluctuations. We show that the mean VAF trajectory has an explicit logistic form determined by selective advantage, while environmental effects affect only the variance and autocovariance structure. Building on these results, we introduce BESTish (Bayesian estimate for selection incorporating scaling-limit to detect mutant heterogeneity), a novel, efficient and accurate Bayesian inference method that can be applied to analyze both cohort-level and longitudinal VAF datasets. BESTish implements the closed-form finite-dimensional distributions that we derive to estimate mutation fitness, mutation rate, and environmental strength for individual CH drivers. When applied to existing CH datasets, BESTish produces consistent mutation fitness inferences across different studies, and estimates CH driver mutation rates in agreement with independent experimental studies. Furthermore, BESTish reveals patient-specific heterogeneity in the selective behavior of recurrent mutations, and identifies variants whose dynamics are compatible with non-homeostatic, growth-facilitating environments. BESTish provides a unified and mechanistic framework for quantifying CH evolution, with potential applications for other biological systems where clonal expansions can be measured.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineered Allosteric RNA Editors Enable Compact, Stimulus-Responsive Post-Transcriptional Circuits</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Marzilli, A. M., Ngo, J. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Translational regulation offers a powerful biological control axis with the potential to enable programmable control over synthetic mRNAs. Here, we introduce inducible Deaminases Acting on RNA (iDARs): deaminase domains (DDs) with conditional RNA-editing activities. Using a domain-insertion strategy, we designed autoinhibited enzymes that can be converted into active RNA editors in response to triggers based on small molecules (chemiDARs), intracellular antigens (antiDARs), protease cleavage (lysiDAR), and optical excitation (optiDAR). Coupling these domains with novel stop codon containing RNA substrates enabled conditional protein translation or transcript degradation. Mutational tuning of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6)-binding pockets produced tightly regulated deaminases with minimal basal activity, facilitating dose-dependent readthrough translation in response to low-nanomolar drug concentration, with dynamic ranges exceeding 100-fold. By encoding iDARs alongside their substrates, we developed 'self-editing' polycistronic transcripts capable of directing translation of encoded proteins in a trigger-dependent manner following delivery to cells as in vitro transcribed mRNAs. Overall, iDARs provide a generalizable framework for generating controllable deaminases, enabling the design of post-transcriptional circuits that link biochemical sensing to readouts based on de novo translation or mRNA decay.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cross-strain transferability of CRISPRi systems and design rules from laboratory to clinical Escherichia coli strains</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ban, H., Rondthaler, S. N., +3 authors, Andrews, L. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) has emerged as a versatile approach for targeted gene repression in many organisms, including microbes and bacteria, due to the simple design of sequence-specific transcriptional silencing of gene expression. However, the strain-specific effects on repression efficiency and the host when translating a CRISPRi system from a laboratory strain to non-model strains are not well understood, yet they can present important limitations to its use. Here, we investigated the repression efficiency and toxicity of three CRISPRi systems (one dCas9 and two dCas12a variants) across four different Escherichia coli strains, including a laboratory K-12 strain (MG1655) and three non-model strains that are clinical isolates (probiotic Nissle 1917, uropathogenic CFT073, and uropathogenic UMN026). We evaluated the repression in each strain using sets of guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting along the gene sequence and assayed cytotoxicity of expressing each dCas protein. Growth toxicity from expression of the different dCas proteins notably differed and showed high variation between some host strains. We also observed variable repression among the strains and notably poorer repression in multiple clinical strains. Therefore, we developed a dual gRNA CRISPRi system for enhanced gene silencing among the strains, which achieved up to 824-fold repression in CFT073. The results demonstrate that strain-specific design considerations can arise when a CRISPRi genetic system is transferred to a closely related bacterial strain. These findings provide insight into the relationships between criteria used for CRISPRi genetic design and in vivo activity across non-model E. coli strains, providing guidelines for diverse applications of these tools.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Encapsulation in a bacterial microcompartment shell improves thermal stability of a glycolytic enzyme</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tefft, N. M., Yadav, N. S., +4 authors, TerAvest, M. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Selective encapsulation of target enzymes is an increasingly well studied field with a host of potential applications for biotechnology. Natively, many bacteria utilize bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) for enzyme encapsulation to enhance catalysis. BMCs are protein shells that enable selective localization of targeted metabolic enzymes and may improve catalytic rates by co-localizing pathway enzymes and/or serve to sequester toxic or volatile intermediates. The microcompartment shell of Haliangium ochraceum (HO) is a notable BMC chassis because of its modularity and versatility; it is easily expressed and assembled outside its native host and can accept a wide array of cargo. Recently, it was demonstrated that assembly of HO BMC shells can be easily achieved in vitro. Following up on our previous work on in vivo assembly of HO-BMCs with triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) as model enzyme cargo, here we have demonstrated the advantages of in vitro assembly (IVA) for targeted enzyme encapsulation. We achieved variable loading of BMC shells with targeted amounts of TPI and demonstrated enhanced thermal stability of encapsulated TPI versus free TPI up to 62{degrees}C.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Protein-only centromeric chromatin assembly streamlines human artificial chromosome formation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Birchak, G., Allu, P., +6 authors, Black, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) are inherited through cell divisions alongside natural chromosomes, serving as tools for interrogating chromosomal elements and as vectors for large genetic cargoes. Despite recent progress, large (i.e., multiple Mb) HACs have not been reported. Further, HAC formation via epigenetic seeding of centromeric chromatin currently requires prior engineering of recipient human cells , hampering their potential deployment in many useful cell types. Here, we designed, built, and delivered to human cells a 2 Mb HAC construct that is ~3 times larger than the prior generation. We also report a robust epigenetic centromere seeding approach that initiates immediately upon delivery to the human cell cytoplasm and bypasses genetic engineering of target cells. The HACs are then faithfully inherited in the absence of selection. Thus, formation of functional centromeric chromatin in the same cell cycle of HAC delivery drives high efficiency HAC formation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine Learning Ensemble Reveals Distinct Molecular Pathways of Retinal Damage in Spaceflown Mice</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Casaletto, J. A., Scott, R. T., +45 authors, Mundackal Thomas, D</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) threatens astronaut health during long-duration missions, yet its molecular pathology remains unclear. Two physiological pathways exist: one attributes SANS to microgravity-induced cephalic fluid shift causing increased intracranial pressure, altered CSF flow, blood-brain barrier disruption, and optic disc edema; the other emphasizes radiation-induced oxidative stress affecting electrolyte channels. However, the exact mechanisms are not completely understood in this unique pathophysiologic barrier to human spaceflight. We investigated two cellular stress markers in the retinal tissues of mice (n=16) flown on the International Space Station (ISS): 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), indicating oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation detected via TUNEL assay, indicating apoptosis. Using an ensemble of five machine learning algorithms to analyze gene expression profiles, we identified genes that are most predictive of 4-HNE and TUNEL phenotype values. By identifying the most predictive protein-coding genes, we identified associated molecular pathways whose dysregulation may mechanistically link spaceflight conditions to SANS-related retinal damage. Our findings support oxidative stress and DNA damage as primary drivers in SANS pathology. This computational approach uses robust correlation to reveal pathway associations that may inform future therapeutic investigations, advancing our understanding of SANS molecular mechanisms, and offering potential intervention strategies for protecting astronaut vision during future deep-space missions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fast, accurate and scalable normalization for RNA sequencing data with the RUVprps software package</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Trussart, M., Foroutan, M., +3 authors, Molania, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unwanted variation refers to any source of variability in the data that can compromise down-stream analysis. Effective removal of such variation from gene expression data is essential to derive accurate and meaningful biological results. We refer to this process as normalization. Data may come from a single study or from multiple studies with different sources of unwanted variation. We have previously developed the RUV-III method for normalizing omics data with a strong focus on transcriptomics. Initially, we introduced RUV-III for the normalization of Nanostring nCounter gene expression data, utilizing genuine technical replicates and pseudo-replicates as control samples. Subsequently, we proposed RUV-III with pseudo-replicates of pseudo-samples (PRPS), and which demonstrated its potential in mitigating the effects of different sources of unwanted variation in large and complex RNA-seq studies. To enhance accessibility and performance of this method, we present a new comprehensive R package named RUVprps. The package offers over 100 functions including ones for assessing variation in both biological and unwanted variables, an automated RUV-III normalization process, and metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of the resulting normalizations. Further, it introduces several new features such as ways of identifying unknown sources of unwanted variation, strategies to identify suitable negative control genes, and methods for generating PRPS when information on the biological and unwanted variation is unavailable. The package also implements a faster approach to RUV-III normalization, streamlining its application to large RNA-seq datasets. Our freely available R package and normalization assessment pipeline can help find effective data normalization methods for new data and help benchmark new methods.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An Artificial Intelligence-based framework for protein interaction design with accelerated KAN-based Positive-Unlabeled learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ghosh, S., Mitra, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein design seeks optimal amino acid sequences for target structures, but designing stable protein complexes remains challenging. We introduce a protein interaction design pipeline combining Monte-Carlo simulation with Metropolis-criteria (MCM) and Deep-Learning. It uses Protein-Protein-Interaction(PPI) scores from Deep-Learning-based MaTPIP model to form a PPI-score-based-MCM (PMCM). The workflow integrates PMCM-driven sequence generation, HDBSCAN-clustering-based selection, and validation via AlphaFold2 and Molecular-Dynamics (MD) simulation. Incorporating learned PPI scores enhances efficiency and feature fusion. A Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning classifier accelerates sequence validation, while the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) improves PU learning over Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP). AlphaFold2 predictions yield median Root-Mean-Square-Deviation (RMSD) 1.17 $mathring{A}$, predicted-Template-Modelling (pTM) 0.72, and interface pTM 0.88; 73% of complexes remain within 2 $mathring{A}$ RMSD after 100 ns MD, confirming stability. Interface mutations reveal altered interactions. The KAN-based PU model improves F1-score, precision, and AUC by 5%, 11%, and 2% over MLP. Overall, our method outperforms traditional and simulation-based methods while remaining competitive with modern Deep-Learning design frameworks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Programmable artificial RNA condensates in mammalian cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, S., Franco, E., +13 authors, Plath, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial biomolecular condensates have emerged as powerful tools to control cellular behaviors. Here we introduce a method to build artificial condensates within living mammalian cells through the design of modular RNA motifs formed by a single, short strand of RNA. These condensates emerge spontaneously, creating RNA-rich compartments that remain separated from their surrounding environment. The RNA sequences include stem-loop domains that fold as the RNA is transcribed, and then condense in the nucleus and cytoplasm through loop-loop interactions. These sequences can be optimized and diversified, enabling the generation of distinct, non-mixing condensate populations and the programmable control of their subcellular localization. The RNA motifs can also be modified to recruit small molecules, proteins, and RNA molecules in a sequence-specific manner to the RNA-rich phase. By introducing additional RNAs that link two distinct types of condensates, we can create droplets with multiple subcompartments, whose organization can be controlled by tuning the stoichiometry of different RNA sequences. These artificial condensates provide a versatile platform for studying and manipulating molecular functions inside living cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">miRNA-mRNA Interaction Network Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease for Biomarker Discovery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ray, A., Agarwal, K., +4 authors, Chowdhury, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by widespread dysregulation of gene expression and regulatory pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key post-transcriptional regulators by modulating messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and their disruption can influence synaptic function, neuroinflammation, and neuronal survival. In this study, we present an integrative transcriptome-driven framework to identify AD-associated miRNA-mRNA regulatory signatures and potential biomarkers. Transcriptomic and clinical data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the GEO dataset GSE48552. Differential expression analysis (Welch's t-test with FDR correction) identified 148 significantly dysregulated genes (35 up-regulated, 113 down-regulated) between AD and cognitively normal controls. Experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-target interactions were integrated using miRTarBase and additional target resources, yielding 1,669,089 miRNA-gene interactions involving 3,055 unique miRNAs, with strong enrichment toward down-regulated gene targeting. Functional enrichment analysis revealed convergence of miRNA-regulated genes on synaptic signaling, neuronal communication, intracellular transport, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and PI3K-Akt/MAPK-related pathways. A bipartite miRNA-mRNA regulatory network (2,343 nodes; 14,603 edges) was constructed and analyzed using centrality metrics, highlighting key hub regulators including PBX1 and SLC7A5. Finally, supervised machine learning models trained on selected molecular features achieved strong performance, with ensemble approaches (XGBoost/LightGBM) demonstrating robust discrimination of AD from controls.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Guillaumet-Adkins, A., Sotudeh, N., +11 authors, Knoechel, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Children diagnosed with cancer typically receive standardized treatment regimens. Despite highly protocolized care, children living in poverty experience a greater risk of cancer relapse and higher mortality compared to their more affluent peers. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent childhood cancer, and children with ALL exposed to poverty are more likely to experience early relapse.Using single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze leukemic blasts and their microenvironment at diagnosis we found that poverty-exposed patients with standard-risk B-ALL exhibit transcriptional signatures of steroid resistance at time of diagnosis. Additionally, we observe increased expression of inflammatory signatures in myeloid cells and reduced effector signatures in CD8+ T-cells in children with B-ALL living in poverty. Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying these associations may identify opportunities for risk-adapted therapeutic strategies to improve disease outcomes in pediatric ALL.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omic profiling of pleural effusions: a reservoir-incubator for non-invasive insights into tumor heterogeneity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nieto, P., Caratu, G., +11 authors, Nieto, J. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pleural effusions (PEs) are common in advanced cancer and are routinely sampled for cytological evaluation; however, their full potential as a source of tumor and immune information remains underexplored. Although malignant PEs (MPEs) are increasingly used for liquid biopsy, their cellular complex interactions have not been resolved at high resolution. Here, we present the first comprehensive single-cell and multi-omic atlas of PEs, integrating scRNA-seq, TCR-seq and whole-exome sequencing with lung, breast, or ovarian cancer, as well as non-malignant heart failure controls. We profiled over 200,000 cells and identified more than 30 immune, stromal, and tumor subpopulations across disease contexts. The tumor cell signature in MPEs recapitulates the genomic and transcriptomic features of matched primary tumors, supporting their use for non-invasive tumor profiling. In contrast, immune landscapes varied by disease: lung cancer MPEs were enriched in exhausted CD8 T cells, breast MPEs showed CD4 T helper cell dominance, and ovarian and heart failure PEs harbored tissue-resident myeloid cell populations. These data reveal that PEs are dynamic, disease-specific ecosystems shaped by tumor-driven immune remodeling. By leveraging their cellular diversity, we position MPEs as a powerful platform for studying metastatic adaptation and immune responses in vivo, with direct implications for diagnostics, immune monitoring, and precision oncology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Breast cancer radiogenomics analysis via computational perturbation on AI-driven multi-omics guided image synthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, X., Liu, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Radiogenomics offers a promising non-invasive approach for characterizing breast cancer (BC), yet its progress is often limited by the scarcity of cohorts containing matched imaging and multi-omics data. Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the synthesis of imaging phenotypes from genomic features, but prior work has focused on the combined influence of all genomic signals rather than isolating the effects of specific biological pathways. In this study, we introduce a perturbation-based radiogenomic framework that integrates multi-omics meta-genes with a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to examine how pathway-level alterations influence synthetic BC MRI phenotypes. Seventeen meta-genes derived from Bayesian Tensor Factorization were perturbed at three levels (overexpression, base case, knockout) and synthetic DCE-MRI volumes were generated for each condition. Radiomic features were extracted using MedSAM-guided segmentation and PyRadiomics, followed by statistical evaluation using one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc testing. Among the 17 pathways analyzed, only two meta-genes, representing cell cycle regulation and steroid hormone biosynthesis, produced significant and biologically interpretable changes in tumor size, heterogeneity, and textural patterns. These findings show that computational perturbation can uncover pathway-specific imaging signatures and offer mechanistic insights that complement traditional radiogenomics and explainable AI approaches. This work demonstrates the potential of perturbation-driven generative models to advance precision imaging genomics in BC.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Rampotas, A., Wong, Z., +24 authors, Pule, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeted immunotherapies have revolutionized outcomes for lymphoid malignancies, but success in myeloid neoplasms is limited by the lack of amenable targets and immunologically hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloproliferative neoplasms are chronic myeloid blood cancers, a third of which are driven by mutations in calreticulin (mutCALR). This yields a common neoepitope that binds to, and activates, the thrombopoietin receptor and results in display of the oncoprotein on the extracellular membrane of disease-driving cells, exposing a therapeutic vulnerability. Here, we present a first-in-class chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that specifically targets mutCALR+ cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The CAR T-cell therapy selectively depleted mutCALR+ stem cells from patients with myelofibrosis while sparing healthy stem cells, and improved survival in mutCALR leukemia xenografts. To mimic myelofibrotic marrow, we developed a bespoke human chimeroid model and showed no decrease in the potency of CAR T cell-mediated target cell killing even in a fibrotic tumor microenvironment. We also devised a method to boost cell surface expression of mutCALR in CD34+ cells isolated from patients with accelerated/blast phase MPN (defined as &gt;10 % blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow), enhancing CAR T targeting. This study presents a therapeutic with potential to eradicate mutCALR-driven malignancies and highlights an innovative strategy to evaluate blood cancer-targeting immunotherapies in a relevant TME.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Organoid-Based Transcriptomics Indicate IFIT-Associated Immune Modulation during Cryptotanshinone Treatment in Bladder Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, M., Li, R., +4 authors, Tan, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bladder cancer (BC), particularly muscle-invasive and metastatic disease, remains a major clinical challenge despite recent advances in immunotherapy. In this study, we aimed to identify a promising antitumor compound from five candidate small molecules and to explore its potential roles in BC progression. Through antiproliferative screening, cryptotanshinone (CTS) was identified as the promising candidate. Using both two-dimensional BC cell lines and three-dimensional bladder tumor organoid models, we comprehensively evaluated the effects of CTS on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and organoid growth. To further explore the underlying mechanisms, transcriptomic sequencing based on bladder cancer organoid models, protein-protein interaction network analysis, and public databases (TCGA-BLCA, TIMER, and TISIDB) were integrated to examine immune-related pathways and potential molecular targets associated with CTS. GeneMANIA network prediction and molecular docking analyses were subsequently performed to investigate upstream regulatory networks and the potential interactions between CTS and key components of the cGAS-STING-IFN-I-JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Integrative analyses suggested that IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3 may function as immune-associated genes potentially linked to BC progression, patient prognosis, immune cell infiltration, and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Molecular docking results suggested that CTS may interact with core regulatory proteins within the cGAS-STING-IFN-I-JAK-STAT pathway, potentially influencing IFIT transcriptional regulation. Collectively, these findings indicate that CTS exhibits measurable antitumor and immunomodulatory effects, which may be associated with modulation of the cGAS-STING-IFN-I-JAK-STAT-IFIT signaling axis, supporting its potential as a small-molecule candidate for bladder cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Chromatin compaction upon CDK12 inhibition drives long gene silencing and a combinatorial lethal dependency on PAF1</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liang, J., Itkonen, H. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Loss-of-function mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) define an aggressive subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) characterized by genomic instability, and depletion of CDK12 activity downregulates the expression of long DNA repair genes. While these transcriptional defects are well-documented, potential alterations in chromatin that may topologically affect this silencing and the subsequent adaptive survival mechanisms of tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we employ a dynamic multi-omics strategy to map the remodeling of the RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) complex and chromatin landscape. We utilized 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) metabolic labeling combined with mass spectrometry (MS) to specifically capture the transcriptionally active RNA Pol II complex, distinguishing active elongation complexes from static background, and map how its interactome changes when the activity of the major transcriptional kinases CDK7, CDK9 or CDK12/13 is inhibited. These data are then integrated with ATAC-seq, transcriptomics, and targeted synthetic lethality screen to validate findings from the RNA Pol II capture. We show that, unlike CDK9 inhibition, CDK12/13 inhibition triggers a progressive chromatin compaction. This is characterized by the decrease in the binding activity of CTCF to chromosomes closing, which acts as a physical blockade specifically silencing long genes when CDK12 activity is lost. In response to this topological remodeling, cells launch an adaptive survival program by recruiting the transcription elongation factor PAF1 and the DNA damage sensor DDB1 to the stalled RNA Pol II. We identify PAF1 as a critical vulnerability in this context. Collectively, we identify CDK12 as a regulator of chromatin topology rather than merely an elongation kinase. The chromatin compaction upon CDK12/13 inhibition creates a unique dependency on the PAF1-mediated adaptive remodeling. Specifically, targeting PAF1 converts this stress response into a lethal trap, establishing a potent, kinase-selective combination lethal strategy for CDK12-deficient prostate cancer.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous tumors with rising incidence, necessitating precise preoperative grading for treatment planning. Existing imaging techniques and endoscopic biopsies often fall short due to insufficient markers and tissue samples. Body composition influences tumor biology, yet traditional 2D assessments are time-consuming and lack objectivity. This study aimed to develop a rapid non-invasive predictive model by integrating automatic segmented abdominal volumetric body composition with machine learning to differentiate between low-grade and high-grade GEP-NENs.</p>
