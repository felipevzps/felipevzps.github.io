<h2 class="paper-title">ESMDisPred: A Structure-Aware CNN-Transformer Architecture for Intrinsically Disordered Protein Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kabir, M. W. U., Dey, A., +1 author, Hoque, M. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack stable three-dimensional structures, yet play vital roles in key biological processes, including signaling, transcription regulation, and molecular scaffolding. Their structural flexibility presents significant challenges for experimental characterization and contributes to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Accurate computational prediction of IDPs is important for advancing research and drug discovery, structural biology, and protein engineering. In this study, we introduce ESMDisPred, a novel structure-aware disorder predictor that builds on the representational power of Evolutionary Scale Modeling-2 (ESM2) protein language models. ESMDisPred integrates sequence embeddings with structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to deliver state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. Model performance is further enhanced through feature engineering strategies, including terminal residue encoding, statistical summarization, and sliding-window analysis. To capture both local sequence motifs and long-range dependencies, we designed a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture that balances convolutional efficiency with the representational power of self-attention. On CAID3 benchmarks, our latest model achieves ROC-AUC 0.895, AP 0.778, and a max F1 of 0.759, outperforming recent methods. Our results highlight the importance of integrating protein language model embeddings with explicit structural information for improved disorder prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Positive-Unlabeled Learning for Predicting Small Molecule MS2 Identifiability from MS1 Context and Acquisition Parameters</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bekbergenova, M., Jiang, T., +1 author, Bittremieux, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: The quality of tandem mass spectra critically determines metabolite identifiability in untargeted metabolomics, yet optimizing MS2 acquisition parameters experimentally is costly, time-consuming, and infeasible across the full diversity of samples and instruments. A key obstacle to computational quality assessment is the absence of reliable negative labels: most MS2 spectra remain unannotated not because they are low quality, but because the corresponding compounds are absent from reference libraries. This label ambiguity fundamentally limits supervised learning approaches and complicates acquisition time decision making. Results: We present a deep learning framework that predicts the probability that an MS2 scan will be identifiable using only the preceding MS1 spectrum and instrument acquisition parameters, without inspecting the MS2 spectrum itself. The problem is formulated as positive-unlabeled learning and addressed using a non-negative positive-unlabeled objective, enabling robust training despite missing negative labels. Trained on over eight million MS2 scans from public Orbitrap metabolomics datasets and evaluated on laboratory-disjoint benchmarks, the model recovered 90% of known identifiable spectra in a held-out test set. Predicted probabilities generalized to unseen laboratories and stratified unlabeled spectra in a physicochemically meaningful manner. Independent validation demonstrated that high predicted quality is associated with increased structural explainability, richer fragmentation patterns, canonical precursor charge states, and reduced spectral interference. These results indicate that MS2 identifiability can be anticipated from precursor context and acquisition settings alone. Availability and implementation: Code is available at https://github.com/bittrem ieuxlab/pu_ms2_identifiability. Model weights and processed datasets are available at 10.5281/zenodo.18266932.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A computational framework for designing micron-scale crisscross DNA megastructures</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Aquilina, M., Katzmeier, F., +9 authors, Shih, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Crisscross polymerization enables the assembly of hundreds of unique DNA origami 'slats' into micron-sized structures with nanoscale precision. To design these megastructures, thousands of handle sequences from a fixed library must be assigned to individual slats to encode the desired binding architecture. This complexity presents two major challenges: handles must be selected to minimize parasitic interactions that compete with desired assembly, and the fabrication of hundreds of unique slats creates a substantial logistical burden. Here, we develop a unified framework that standardizes the design and fabrication of crisscross megastructures. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize handle assignment and minimize parasitic binding between slats, paired with a graph-based algorithm that expands the handle library. Together, these algorithms enable the assembly of large, multi-layered megastructures that otherwise would be produced at negligible yields. We have released this framework as #-CAD, an open-source graphical application that integrates these algorithms, streamlines laboratory workflows, and makes crisscross DNA origami more broadly accessible.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DeltaNMF: A Two-Stage Neural NMF for Differential Gene Program Discovery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Karpurapu, A., Gersbach, C. A., Singh, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a foundational dimensionality-reduction method in single-cell transcriptomics, valued for its interpretable gene programs. However, in case-control settings common in perturbation and disease research, standard NMF conflates quantitative shifts in program usage with qualitative emergence of novel programs, obscuring whether observed differences reflect altered activity of shared programs or genuinely new cellular states. Here, we present DeltaNMF, a neural network-based reformulation of NMF that enables flexible biological priors and structured multi-stage fitting. We first demonstrate how our framework incorporates foundation model-derived gene similarities through graph-Laplacian regularization, improving program coherence by 2.4-fold on protein interaction networks. Building on this flexibility, we introduce a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates baseline programs (learned from control cells) from case-specific programs, disambiguating altered usage from novel program emergence. Our GPU-accelerated implementation achieves 20x speedup over consensus NMF while maintaining comparable accuracy. On synthetic data with known ground truth, DeltaNMF correctly identifies which programs are new versus shifted. Applied to coronary artery disease (CAD) Perturb-seq data, DeltaNMF isolates disease programs including the cerebral cavernous malformations pathway identified by Schnitzler et al., while clearly distinguishing them from baseline endothelial programs with altered activity. Our neural network formulation of NMF opens new directions for incorporating diverse biological priors into interpretable single-cell analysis, providing a principled framework for differential program discovery in case-control studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Systems-Level Transcriptomic Analysis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome as a Mitochondrial-Immunometabolic Disorder</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">PATIAL, R., Ray, S., +1 author, Sobti, R. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is known as an endocrine and metabolic disorder; however, emerging molecular evidence suggests a far more complex systems-level pathology. In this study, we performed an integrative transcriptomic and pathway-level analysis of endometrial tissue from women with PCOS to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism facilitating the disorder. The findings of the study highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic oxidative stress, and multi-layered immune dysregulation, adding some new insight apart from classical hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. We identified some novel gene disease associations which involve C15orf48, ODF3B PRR15-DT, LINC01176, and LOC105379193. The upstream regulators such as (NFE2L2, TWNK, ALKBH1, BCOR, SMARCA4) involved in processes including mitochondrial genome, redox balance, and chromatin remodeling provided new insights into regulatory mechanisms. The IPA pathway analysis validated the compromised immune recovery with low grade inflammations and mitochondrial dysfunctionality. The observations emphasize on complex associations discarding its PCOS pure endocrine nature through immunometabolic-mitochondrial dysfunctionalities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Generative modeling reveals the connection between cellular morphology and gene expression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wen, S., Vinas, R., +9 authors, Brbic, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The understanding of how transcriptional programs give rise to cellular morphology, and how morphological features reflect and influence cell identity and function remains limited. This is due in part to the lack of large-scale datasets pairing the two modalities as well as the absence of computational frameworks capable of modeling their cross-modal structure. Here, we introduce COSMIC, a bidirectional generative framework that enables quantitative decomposition of transcriptional variance reflected in morphology and morphological variance explained by gene expression. COSMIC builds on a foundation model trained on over 21 million segmented nuclei and couples it with existing transcriptomic embeddings. To enable cross-modal learning, we leveraged a newly generated multimodal dataset acquired using IRIS, a technology that captures high-resolution images and transcriptomes from the same single cells at scale. COSMIC accurately modeled cell type identity, as well as continuous dynamics such as cell-cycle progression, establishing a quantitative link between morphological phenotypes and underlying gene expression. In prostate cancer cells, COSMIC identified morphological and transcriptomic differences between chemotherapy drug treatment-responsive and -resistant cells, and revealed morphology-associated genes linked to tumor state. Together, these results demonstrate that generative modeling powered by paired single-cell measurements can capture the bidirectional flow of information between cellular form and gene expression, opening new avenues for mechanistic discovery and predictive modeling in both basic and translational cell biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Anticipating on-target resistance to WRN inhibitors in microsatellite unstable cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Orcholski, M. E., Laterreur, N., +10 authors, Cuella-Martin, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Leveraging WRN helicase dependency in microsatellite instability (MSI) cancers offers a synthetic lethal (SL) therapeutic opportunity, with several WRN inhibitors in development. However, the hypermutator nature of MSI tumors creates strong evolutionary pressure for rapid resistance. Here, we apply a multimodal functional genomics framework integrating base editing screens and deep mutational scanning to map on-target resistance to two clinical WRN inhibitors, HRO761 and VVD-214. We identify discrete resistance hotspots within WRN and demonstrate that single-allele (heterozygous) mutations at the drug-binding site are sufficient to abrogate WRN inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity. Resistance profiles diverged between HRO761 and VVD-214, revealing mutations that impair one but preserve sensitivity to the other. Genome-wide CRISPR screens further identified non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factors and the checkpoint phosphatase WIP1 as tractable synthetic vulnerabilities that potentiate WRN inhibition. Together, these findings establish a framework for resistance-aware deployment of WRN inhibitors through rational drug selection, therapeutic switching, and combination strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">YAP/TEAD drives treatment-induced adaptive immunosuppression in EGFR-mutant lung cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Honkanen, M., Baumgarten, J., +16 authors, Kurppa, K. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Residual disease remains a major obstacle for achieving durable responses in patients treated with oncogene-targeted therapy. Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells emerging under treatment and persisting in residual tumors are considered to be the root of acquired resistance, yet their contribution to immune evasion in on-treatment tumors is poorly defined. Here, we show in the context of EGFR-mutant lung cancer that DTP cells actively contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment during EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. In syngeneic mouse models and in patients, EGFR TKI therapy leads to an accumulation of immunosuppressive macrophages, which is strictly treatment-dependent and fully reversible upon treatment cessation or progressive disease, respectively. Quiescent DTP cells directly drive the recruitment and immunosuppressive reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages through a YAP-driven secretome, and the DTP-reprogrammed monocytes suppress T cell proliferation and effector functions in vitro. Co-targeting YAP with a TEAD inhibitor ORM-47286 rewires the DTP secretome and inhibits macrophage reprogramming in vitro, and prevents immunosuppressive macrophage accumulation and improves the efficacy of EGFR TKI therapy in immunocompetent mouse models. Our findings highlight the previously unappreciated role of DTP cells in modulating the tumor microenvironment in on-treatment tumors, and position the treatment-induced YAP/TEAD activity in DTP cells as an important driver of adaptive immunosuppression during EGFR-targeted therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Forecasting tumor growth kinetics and hypoxia levels in mice using mathematical modelling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Azzopardi, N., Ternant, D., +4 authors, Chadet, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantitative description of tumor growth is challenged by vascular heterogeneity and hypoxia. In this study, mammary tumor growth was investigated in mouse model using caliper and ultrasound imaging measurements, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and pimonidazole imaging. Tumor volume increased monotonically when assessed by caliper and ultrasound imaging, whereas BLI exhibited oscillating dynamics despite continued tumor growth, consistent with hypoxia-related signal attenuation. A mathematical compartmental model was developed primarily to describe tumor growth dynamics, incorporating latent vascular capacity as a key regulatory variable. The model accounts for reciprocal interactions between tumor expansion and vascular limitation. BLI was integrated as an auxiliary observable to reveal hypoxia-driven modulation of signal production rather than as a direct surrogate of tumor size. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with population approach, allowing quantification of population-level behavior and inter-individual variability. The model adequately described tumor growth while explaining BLI dynamics through vascular and hypoxic effects. This framework provides the first semi-mechanistic description of tumor growth and supports the use of BLI as an indirect marker of hypoxia and, consequently, of tumor growth. This model may provide a useful framework for quantifying the effects of vascular-modulating therapeutics and genetic polymorphisms involved in tumor progression.</p>
