<h2 class="paper-title">Decoding Promoter Activity from DNA Sequence using Pre-trained Language Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jung, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Promoter architecture plays a central role in transcriptional regulation, yet predicting promoter activity directly from DNA sequence remains challenging. Here, we assess whether transformer-based DNA language models can learn and interpret regulatory logic encoded in Drosophila core promoters. We fine-tuned the 117-million-parameter DNABERT-2 model on ~700 synthetic promoters assayed by ~2,600 dual-luciferase measurements in Drosophila S2 cells. A sequence-only model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 {approx} 0.91), demonstrating that core promoter sequence alone strongly constrains transcriptional output. Model interpretability using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed biologically meaningful sequence features corresponding to canonical core promoter elements. Extending the model to incorporate biological context, including Ecdysone (Ecd) hormonal activation and flanking -1/+1 nucleosomal sequences, preserved strong performance while capturing more complex promoter behavior. Gene-wise cross-validation showed robust generalization for most promoters, and application to independent in vivo embryo data demon-strated that the model still generalizes reasonably well, even in complex biological contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering auronidin production in Marchantia polymorpha enables a new class of plant-derived textile pigments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lormet, A., Haseloff, J., Romani, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Plant-derived pigments offer sustainable alternatives to synthetic colorants, yet their practical deployment in textiles is limited by restricted chemical diversity and low abundance. Liverworts represent a source of diverse chemical compounds, and the model liverworts Marchantia polymorpha is an emerging as chassis for bioengineering and synthetic biology. Here, we report the biotechnological application of auronidins, a rare class of flavonoid pigments, as textile dyes. Using the Marchantia, we engineered enhanced auronidin production through controlled expression of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor MpMYB14. We systematically benchmarked constitutive and inducible gene expression systems, including heat-shock, glucocorticoid receptor, and {beta}-estradiol (XVE) circuits, identifying inducible strategies that decouple biomass accumulation from secondary metabolite production while achieving high pigment yields. Extracted auronidins were used to dye cotton yarn directly, demonstrating the feasibility of auronidins for textile dyeing. Our results establish Marchantia as a versatile plant chassis for programmable secondary metabolite production and introduce auronidins as a promising natural pigment platform for sustainable textile biotechnology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Accurate somatic variant detection from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) derived WES and WGS by DeepOmicsFFPE-PLUS, a sequence context-based transformer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kim, W. S., Lee, A., +13 authors, Heo, D.-h.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues represent a vast archival resource for genomic studies, yet their utility remains constrained by fixation-induced DNA damage and subsequent sequencing artifacts. To comprehensively characterize and address this challenge, we analyzed matched FFPE and fresh-frozen tumor samples from two institutions, spanning different storage durations, DNA qualities, sequencing platforms (WES and WGS), exome capture kits, and somatic variant callers. We found that FFPE-induced artifacts exhibit strong batch- and age-specific patterns, with a predominance of C:G&gt;T:A substitutions, which particularly complicate the accurate identification of low allele frequency true variants. Enzymatic repair methods partially alleviated these artifacts but remained insufficient. To overcome these limitations, we developed DeepOmicsFFPE-PLUS(https://github.com/Theragen-Bio/DeepOmicsFFPE-PLUS), an advanced AI-based tool to accurately distinguish true somatic variants from FFPE-specific artifacts. DeepOmicsFFPE-PLUS demonstrated consistently superior performance across diverse conditions, achieving high sensitivity and specificity-even for low-frequency variants-outperforming existing tools. Application of our model to WGS data further enabled recovery of biologically relevant mutational signatures, including restoration of microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated signatures initially obscured by FFPE artifacts. Our findings underscore the necessity of artifact-aware variant calling in FFPE genomics and establish DeepOmicsFFPE-PLUS as a robust tool for artifact removal, enabling high-fidelity downstream analyses and personalized therapeutic target discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineered probiotics for tumor-targeted combination chemoimmunotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, Z., Im, J., +4 authors, Arpaia, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Achieving tumor-specific delivery and sustained activation of both cytotoxic and immune-modulating agents remains a critical challenge in chemoimmunotherapy. Here, we present a bacterial platform engineered to combine enzyme/prodrug chemotherapy with immunotherapy, where tumor-homing E. coli Nissle 1917 expresses cytosine deaminase to convert the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine into the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil within tumors. Concurrently, the engineered bacteria produce an IL-15 superagonist and a PD-L1 blocking nanobody to mitigate the immunosuppressive effects of tumor-localized chemotherapy. This platform demonstrated potent antitumor effects in the murine MC38 solid tumor model. Mechanistic studies showed that the combination therapy enhances activation of antigen-presenting cells, T cells and natural killer cells, while reducing immunosuppressive populations. In summary, our approach integrates enzyme/prodrug therapy and immunotherapy into a single bacterial delivery system, overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies and offering a scalable and precision-engineered strategy with an improved safety profile for synergistic cancer treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">In situ programming of intratumoural stem cell-like memory CD8+ T cells enables durable antitumour immunity in immunosuppressive tumours</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, X., Vitlic, A., +7 authors, Honeychurch, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumours with an immunosuppressive microenvironment often respond poorly to radiotherapy (RT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors, and durable clinical responses remain rare. These failures are not solely explained by insufficient immune activation, but instead reflect an inability of current therapies to establish CD8+ T-cell infiltration and states required for long-term tumour control. Although stem cell-like memory CD8+ T cells (Tscm) are critical for durable antitumour immunity, they are typically rare within solid tumours, and strategies to selectively augment the expansion of intratumoural Tscm within immunosuppressive tumours are lacking. Here, we show that intratumoural immune modulation via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation, using a double-stranded RNA-based agonist (BO-112), promotes Tscm expansion and, in combination with radiation, enhances antitumour immunity in poorly immunogenic lung and bladder cancer models. PRR activation enabled selective in situ expansion of intratumoural Tscm, rather than global CD8+ T-cell activation. Therapeutic efficacy required pre-existing intratumoural CD8+ T cells and was associated with qualitative reprogramming of the immune landscape, including depletion of exhausted CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic analyses showed that PRR activation preferentially enriched programmes associated with Tscm formation and self-renewal, whereas durable effector differentiation emerged only following combined RT-PRR agonist treatment, consistent with antigen-driven execution of the expanded progenitor pool. A Tscm-associated gene signature derived from these preclinical datasets correlated with improved survival across independent human lung and bladder cancer cohorts. Together, our data identify intratumoural Tscm as a therapeutically targetable immune-control axis and establish in situ programming of Tscm as a route to durable antitumour immunity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) overexpression and nucleolar localization in response to bortezomib in multiple myeloma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Arakawa, Y., Taniyama, D., +2 authors, Pommier, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins belonging to the Schlafen family are interferon-inducible and participate in the regulation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and proteotoxic stress. SLFN11 kills cells with replicative damage, serving as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapeutic response. SLFN11 is epigenetically downregulated in {approx}50% of solid tumors. Here we examined SLFN11 expression and significance in multiple myeloma (MM). Using TCGA and MMRF CoMMpass datasets, we find SLFN11 is consistently highly expressed across MM subtypes except CD1 and MAF/MAFB. CD138-positive normal and myeloma plasma cells retain SLFN11 expression even when proliferative activity (MKI67/Ki-67) increases with disease progression. SLFN11 expression strongly correlates with super-enhancer-driven plasma cell transcriptional programs. We report that bortezomib, a first-line MM treatment, induces SLFN11 accumulation in nucleoli with suppression of ribosomal RNA synthesis. SLFN11 knockout cells show enhanced bortezomib sensitivity and exatecan resistance, supporting SLFN11's protective role in proteotoxic stress and sensitizing role in replication stress. This study reveals that SLFN11 undergoes nucleolar translocation in response to proteasome inhibition in multiple myeloma, suppressing ribosomal RNA synthesis and conferring resistance to bortezomib while maintaining sensitivity to topoisomerase I inhibitors, thereby establishing SLFN11 as a dual-function biomarker for precision therapy selection in this disease.</p>
