<h2 class="paper-title">MFAID-Net: A Multi-modal Feature Fusion Deep Learning Network for Robust Adaptive Introgression Detection Across Diverse Evolutionary Scenarios</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shan, L., Yao, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive introgression (AI), the beneficial genetic transfer between species, is key to adaptation, yet its genomic identification is challenging. Existing methods are inconsistent and often require unavailable donor population data. We propose MFAID-Net, a novel multi-modal network for adaptive introgression detection. MFAID-Net employs a dual-encoder architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network for local genomic features with a Multi-Layer Perceptron for population genetic statistics and structure. A Transformer-like attention mechanism adaptively fuses modalities, dynamically weighting their importance. Multi-task learning differentiates AI from confounding signals like neutral introgression and selective sweeps. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate MFAID-Net's superior performance across challenging scenarios (e.g., strong/weak selection, ancient migration), often outperforming current methods. It is also robust to donor data availability. Ablation and attention analyses confirm component contributions and provide interpretability. MFAID-Net offers a more robust, accurate, and adaptable tool for discovering AI events.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering chimeric DNA polymerases for DNA movable type storage</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, X., Zhao, Q., +5 authors, Li, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA-based information storage offers a promising alternative to conventional media due to its high density, long-term stability, and low energy requirements. However, its application remains hindered by synthesis costs, limited sequence length and poor scalability. DNA polymerase is a critical enzymatic tool in the DNA storage systems by enabling high-fidelity data writing and targeted sequence amplification. In this study, we engineered chimeric DNA polymerases by fusing the high-fidelity 9{degrees}N DNA polymerase with double-stranded DNA binding proteins derived from thermophilic archaea. These fusions significantly enhanced processivity, thermal stability, and salt tolerance by stabilizing enzyme-template interactions, mimicking sliding clamps while preserving catalytic efficiency. Leveraging these properties, we demonstrated precise file retrieval from a mixed oligonucleotide pool using orthogonal barcode primers. Compared with wild-type 9{degrees}N, the chimeric polymerases, particularly PLS, exhibited reduced substitution error rates and improved read accuracy. We then applied these enzymes to a DNA movable type storage system, where prefabricated DNA modules were assembled into encoding blocks. Using engineered polymerases, these blocks were recombined to enable flexible data rewriting without de novo DNA synthesis. Moreover, a multi-enzyme assembly strategy enabled the construction of kilobase-scale DNA sequences encoding a classical Chinese poem, achieving complete data recovery. All assembled fragments remained stable in E. coli over 100 generations, exhibiting the potential for in vivo storage. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the role of engineered DNA polymerases for DNA-based information storage. Moreover, this system reduced synthesis demands, supported scalable rewriting, and ensured long-term preservation, offering a practical route to sustainable, high-fidelity DNA data storage.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transfer of the synechan biosynthesis and regulatory pathway enables sulfated polysaccharide production in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Maeda, K., Ohdate, K., +2 authors, Watanabe, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many sulfated polysaccharides (SPSs) possess useful physicochemical properties and biological activities and are widely used in industry. Currently, major SPSs are derived from livestock and marine organisms. To contribute both to addressing global environmental challenges and to the development of diverse SPSs, microbial production systems are therefore required. Nevertheless, bacteria capable of producing SPSs are limited. In contrast, many cyanobacteria synthesize diverse SPSs, making them promising hosts to produce valuable SPSs, sources for novel SPSs, and genetic resources for SPS biosynthesis. However, no study has introduced an entire heterologous SPS biosynthetic system into cyanobacteria to produce a heterologous SPS. We recently identified a novel SPS, synechan, and elucidated the genetic basis for the biosynthesis and regulation of cyanobacterial SPSs. Here, we heterologously expressed the gene set responsible for synechan biosynthesis and its regulation in the non-SPS-producing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and successfully induced the production of an SPS. This work provides a foundation for engineering cyanobacteria to produce useful SPSs and, to our knowledge, the first functional heterologous reconstitution in cyanobacteria of a large gene cluster encoding a complex membrane-associated biosynthetic system and thus an important step in synthetic-biology-based engineering of cyanobacteria.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Growth control as a central regulator for tuning the cellular context</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hueso-Gil, A., Miro-Bueno, J., Goni-Moreno, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The cellular context interacts with genetic circuits, decisively defining their performance. However, contextual dependencies (the interplay between the host and the circuit) are often difficult to engineer rationally, leading to a lack of control over circuit behaviour. To address this challenge, we replaced the native regulatory machinery of the RNA polymerase (RNAP), the cell's core protein-making machine, from the bacteria Pseudomonas putida KT2440 with an inducible system, enabling tunable growth regulation and thereby gaining systemic control over the entire cellular machinery. Specifically, this was achieved by placing key components, the {beta} and {beta}' subunits of the enzyme, under the control of the XylS-Pm inducible system. By using its cognate chemical inducer, 3-methylbenzoate, cell's growth can be controlled at will, enabling the precise tuning of the cellular context into distinct, stable states. We correlated genetic circuit behaviour with the cell's growth state by observing the constitutive expression of a reporter gene and the performance of a collection of genetic NOT logic gates. Our results show that the modulation of contextual dependencies is specific to the circuit components but not a random process. A mathematical model allowed us to classify that modulation into three different categories for our library of NOT gates, based on the prediction of how RNAP availability shapes host-circuit interaction. Finally, using growth control as an input for a 2-input circuit lead to a NAND gate with the potential for morphological computing, where the cell's physical body itself undertakes part of the information processing. Our findings indicate that growth control can be used as an engineering parameter, allowing us to search for optimal scenarios that enhance the potential of genetic tools.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SpineDL: a Deep Learning-based approach for neuron andanatomical structure segmentation in immunofluorescenceimages of damaged spinal cords</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ruiz-Amezcua, P., Franco-Barranco, D., +3 authors, Nieto-Diaz, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this study, we present SpineDL, an open-source deep learning (DL) approach for neurons and anatomical structure segmentation of the spinal cord in fluorescence images immunostained with NeuN and DAPI, within the context of murine models of spinal cord injury (SCI). SpineDL comprises two main modules: 1) SpineDL-Structure, for semantic segmentation of key spinal cord structures: gray matter, white matter, ependyma, and damaged tissue; and 2) SpineDL-Neuron, for instance-level identification of neuronal somas. To train the models, we developed the SpineDL dataset, a curated collection of 161 confocal images of mouse spinal cord, manually annotated by experts and organized into specific subsets. Both models are based on the HRNetV2-W48 architecture and were trained using state-of-the-art data augmentation and optimization techniques, implemented within the BiaPy framework, following an iterative refinement process driven by quantitative evaluation and expert feedback. Our results show that SpineDL achieves expert-level performance for both cases of structural segmentation and neuron identification. This work provides a robust, reproducible, and extensible platform for the spatial analysis of neurodegeneration following spinal cord injury, representing a step toward the automation of histopathological workflows in neuroscience.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating and refining the predictions of ensembled plant effector detection programs using machine learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Odunlami, L., MacLean, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Effectors are pathogen proteins that facilitate infection by manipulating plant immunity. Computational programs have been developed that identify effectors from sequence data. Many of these programs use internal models that have unavoidable biases due to their training processes and the diverse nature of effector sequence, function and phylogeny. Each programs ability to predict effectors across a broad range of plant pathogens is therefore limited. We hypothesised that a meta-predictor constructed using machine learning (ML) approaches could integrate predictions from multiple programs and improve our ability to predict effectors more accurately from bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. We trained a range of classifiers using classical ML approaches and deep neural networks (DNNs), then selected eight: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and five DNNs for evaluation. The training, test and validation data were carefully curated from effector and non-effector annotated sequence derived from the training and sample data of six programs: EffectorP 3.0, deepredeff, WideEffHunter, EffectorO, EffectiveT3, T3SEpp. The models were tested against existing programs on a test dataset, and we observed better performance from our models. The best-performing model was a DNN (Model_2) that balanced improved sensitivity with specificity across the three taxa. We observed using SHAP that all the features contributed to the output of Model_2, which might be the reason for its superior performance. The DNN was developed into a package, fimep, to allow easy use of our model.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TRIO-AI: Hybrid temporal graph, ODE, and VAE modeling for high-resolution cellular trajectory inference in liver injury</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">li, h., Ju, C., +2 authors, Wang, j.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Resolving dynamic cellular transitions at single-cell resolution is essential for understanding complex biological processes in development, disease, and regeneration. However, existing trajectory inference methods struggle to capture heterogeneous temporal dynamics, particularly for rare or transitional cell populations critical to injury and repair responses. Here, we present TRIO-AI, a hybrid computational framework that synergistically integrates three complementary approaches: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (Temporal GNN) for branching detection, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) for continuous state flow modeling, and Time- Variational Autoencoders (Time-VAE) for density-based transitional state identification. We applied TRIO-AI to single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury across multiple timepoints (days 0, 1, 3, and 5 post-injury), comprehensively characterizing major hepatic macrophage populations. TRIO-AI identified a distinct transitional macrophage population (MPs_3) that peaks at 48 hours post-injury and exhibits coordinated signatures for lipid handling (LRP1, LRP6, ABCA1, LDLR, SCARB1), efferocytosis (MARCO, MERTK, MSR1), and extracellular matrix engagement (ITGA9, ITGB1, SDC2). This population serves as a critical integrator of multicellular pro-reparative signals through APOE-LRP1 and FN1-ITGA9 signaling axes. Spatial transcriptomics validation confirmed MPs_3 localization to peri-necrotic borders with dramatic enrichment of APOE-LRP1 co-localization at 48 hours (19 pairs) compared to 24 hours (3 pairs). Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art methods demonstrated TRIO-AI's superior performance in detecting transitional states, accurately reconstructing branching trajectories, and identifying off-path populations missed by conventional approaches. This framework provides a powerful platform for dissecting cellular dynamics in complex biological systems and reveals new insights into macrophage-mediated tissue repair mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantum Chemical Profiling of Protein Mutations via Fragment-Based DFT</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Leyva, A., Niazi, M. K. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Missense mutations have been extensively studied in tumor-suppressing antigens (TP53) to understand oncogenesis within malignant epithelial cells. Using Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS), missense mutations can be profiled into protein sequences to identify the most common variants in tumor samples. Since nearly 80% of mutations arise randomly, it is necessary to isolate those that produce dysfunctional proteins within large cohorts. Using threading and generative algorithms such as AlphaFold and ColabFold, large cohorts of WXS information can be converted into computationally analyzable structures. By evaluating both high- and low-confidence regions in these structures, these antigens can be studied en masse using pipelines that generate analytical inputs for quantum chemistry analysis. we created a pipeline that processed whole-exome sequencing (WXS) data and selected 28 representative TP53 missense mutants from the TCGA-BRCA cohort for quantum-chemical feasibility analysis. These structures were systematically cleaned using tools such as OpenBabel and AmberTools, and each was prepared for Natural Population Analysis (NPA), Electrostatic Potential (ESP) calculations, and Highest and Lowest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO/LUMO) evaluation within Q-Chem. Using this pipeline, population genomics can be integrated with chemoinformatics to analyze electron density concentrations and generate hypothesis-generating electronic descriptors associated with protein dysfunction. By modifying the generated inputs, additional analyses such as Fukui orbitals, chemical shifts, and Raman shifts can also be performed. This provides a computational means to probe electronic properties not readily accessible at scale using experimental techniques.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Radiopharmaceutical therapy for metastatic prostate cancer: Insights from mechanistic modeling and in silico trials</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Italia, M., Bordel-Vozmediano, S., +2 authors, Perez-Garcia, V. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) has rapidly evolved into a key precision-oncology modality, with radioligands now approved or in late-stage development for multiple solid tumors, including neuroendocrine and prostate cancers. RPT with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen) has recently been approved as a life-prolonging treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but its clinical use still relies on non-personalized, empirically chosen fixed schedules. Here, we develop a mechanistic, patient-personalizable mathematical model simulating mCRPC response and organ-at-risk toxicity during [177Lu]Lu-PSMA RPT. The model integrates tumor growth dynamics, radiobiological response, and organ-resolved pharmacokinetics inferred from mass data and standardized uptake values obtained from positron emission tomography studies. Parameters were derived from the literature, although the framework allows personalization by fitting to patient-specific data such as imaging and prostate-specific antigen levels. Using virtual patient (VP) cohorts generated via stochastic parameter sampling, we conducted in silico trials and validated the model by comparing simulated outcomes with published dosimetry and survival data for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA trials. We then explored dosing and scheduling strategies to optimize efficacy-toxicity trade-offs. Consolidated regimens with fewer, higher-activity injections improved overall survival (OS) in silico but increased OAR toxicity, especially in kidneys. Cycle length had a weaker influence on OS within a 2-9 week window, while it clearly affected toxicity, whereas excessive delays (&gt;12 weeks) markedly reduced efficacy. Global sensitivity analysis identified tumor growth, uptake, and radiosensitivity parameters as key drivers of interpatient variability, and convergence testing confirmed robustness with respect to VP cohort size. These methodological findings illustrate how mechanistic modeling and in silico trials can inform the design and personalization of RPT regimens.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PKMYT1 inhibition induces DNA damage and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade in CCNE1-amplified gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jang, S., Wu, L. W., +7 authors, Moy, R. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: CCNE1 amplification, found in approximately 10% of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA), drives chromosomal instability and is associated with an immune-cold tumor microenvironment. Recent studies suggest that PKMYT1 inhibition is synthetic lethal in CCNE1-amplified cancers; however, its role in GEA is largely uncharacterized. We investigated the therapeutic activity of PKMYT1 inhibition in CCNE1-amplified GEA and its potential combination with immunotherapy. Experimental Design: We evaluated lunresertib (RP-6306), a selective first-in-class PKMYT1 inhibitor, in CCNE1-amplified and wild-type GEA cell lines to define its effects on cell viability, DNA damage, and gene expression changes. To investigate the role of PKMYT1 blockade on immune microenvironment modulation, we used a syngeneic murine model of CCNE1;Trp53-/- GEA xenografts treated with lunresertib, anti-PD-1, or the combination. Results: Lunresertib was selectively cytotoxic in CCNE1-amplified GEA cell lines in cell viability and clonogenic assays. Mechanistically, treatment with lunresertib induced DNA damage, evidence by increased {gamma}H2AX expression and DNA micronuclei formation, and activated pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by gene set enrichment analysis. In a CCNE1-amplified GEA murine model, PKMYT1 inhibition promoted T cell infiltration, reduced myeloid cells, and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy to induce tumor regression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CCNE1 amplification is a potentially actionable target in GEA and support the development of combination therapeutic strategies utilizing PKMYT1 inhibition and PD-1 blockade.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genome editing for treatment of JAK2 V617F-driven myeloproliferative neoplasms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Doll, R. M., Shen, Y., +11 authors, Davies, J. O. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> JAK2 V617F is a common haematological driver mutation and underlies most cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Reducing variant allele frequency (VAF) is an important treatment goal, but no current treatment modalities fully and specifically inhibit mutant signalling. Thus, the consequences of V617F inactivation are unclear, including whether selective inhibition of V617F signalling will eradicate mutant cells due to oncogene addiction. Here, we describe an allele-selective CRISPR-Cas genome editing strategy that achieves selective and efficient JAK2 V617F inactivation in patient stem and progenitor cells. We show that JAK2 V617F heterozygous cells are not oncogene addicted and maintain viability and differentiation potential upon loss of their mutant allele. In contrast, homozygous mutant cells are eradicated upon deletion of both mutant alleles. Across in vitro, organoid, xenotransplantation and single-cell assays, selective deletion of V617F alleles reverts MPN hallmarks including erythroid clonogenicity, inflammatory gene expression signatures, as well as myelofibrosis and splenomegaly phenotypes in an in vivo xenograft model. Collectively, our results show that is it possible to revert heterozygous JAK2 V617F mutant cells to a normal phenotype and suggest that ex vivo genome editing of stem and progenitor cells may be a viable treatment option to achieve rapid and deep reductions in VAF.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The lncRNA PACER Regulates Lung Adenocarcinoma Phenotypes via COX-2 Signaling and RNA Structural Dynamics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lutz, C. S., Desind, S. Z., +3 authors, Shorrock, H. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs with critical roles in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, including cancer. Dysregulated lncRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) contributes to oncogenic mechanisms through immune and inflammatory signaling networks, including the arachidonic acid (AA) signaling pathway. Here, we investigate the functional significance of the lncRNA PACER (PTGS2 Antisense NF-{kappa}B1 Complex-Mediated Expression Regulator), which modulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in the AA pathway. Using stable shRNA-mediated knockdown in A549 LUAD cells, we show that PACER silencing reduces COX-2 expression and impairs cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis using LncLOOM revealed conserved motifs across primates and mice, including predicted binding sites for miR-18a-5p, miR-196-5p, miR-1306-5p, and miR-423-3p. To define PACER's structural organization, we performed selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP), generating the first secondary structure determination of PACER. SHAPE-MaP and SuperFold analyses revealed a compact, stabilized 5' domain and a flexible central and 3' region. {Delta}SHAPE analysis identified multiple sites of differential protection, and Rsample clustering resolved two dominant in vivo conformations, suggesting that PACER adopts a modular architecture with defined structural domains. These structured regions coincide with conserved motifs associated with NF-{kappa}B p50 and predicted miRNA binding sites, indicating that PACER function may depend on conformational switching that modulates protein and miRNA accessibility. Together, these findings establish PACER as a regulator of LUAD proliferation and invasion via COX-2 signaling and highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in inflammatory cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Large extracellular vesicles regulate endothelial angiogenic potential via paracrine and autocrine signaling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Richmond, G., Nguyen, R., +1 author, Schorey, J., D'Souza-Schorey, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Angiogenesis, a process typically associated with tumor growth and development, is often linked to advanced disease and poor clinical outcomes. Tumor cells establish a pro-angiogenic microenvironment through the release of paracrine signaling mediators including extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs have been shown to facilitate intercellular communication and encompass a diverse range of secreted vesicles, including small EVs (sEVs) which range in size from ~60 to 100nm and large EVs (L-EVs) which are even more diverse and range from 200nm to several microns in size. Despite advancements in anti-angiogenic cancer therapies, such as bevacizumab, late-stage tumors, including advanced melanomas, exhibit mixed clinical responses. In this study, we elucidate a unique role for melanoma-derived L-EVs in promoting bevacizumab-insensitive endothelial angiogenic phenotypes. This L-EV-mediated increase in endothelial tube formation is sensitive to the effects of sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, but not SU5416, a selective VEGF-receptor inhibitor. We also demonstrate that melanoma L-EVs contain VEGF as luminal cargo and induce paracrine effects by modulating the endothelial EV secretome. The release from endothelial cells of soluble VEGF, EVs, and pro-angiogenic cytokines such as IL-8, MIF, and PAI-1 drive sustained endothelial tube formation through autocrine signaling. Finally, we show that EV subtypes have distinct effects on the acquisition of angiogenic phenotypes and their roles vary with tumor type. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of angiogenic therapy resistance in melanoma and demonstrate the differential functions of EV subtypes in angiogenesis across tumor types.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Aspartate Transaminases Are Dispensable for Pancreatic Development and Pancreatic Cancer Progression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ugras, J., Nelson, N., +17 authors, Lyssiotis, C. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. This is due in part to the limited availability of effective treatment options for patients, highlighting a significant need for new targets and approaches. Deregulated metabolism is a hallmark feature of PDA that has gained attention as a promising inroad for therapy. The aspartate transaminases (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases, cytosolic GOT1 and mitochondrial GOT2) have several important metabolic functions, including maintaining energy and redox balance and generating aspartate, an essential building block in protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. Previous studies of GOT proteins in preclinical tumor transplant models have yielded conflicting results regarding the requirement of GOT1 and GOT2 for PDA tumor growth. To assess the role of GOT proteins in tumor development and tumor maintenance, we generated conditional knockout mice for Got1 and Got2 and crossed these into pancreas-specific models. Whereas loss of either Got does not impact pancreas development, double Got1 and Got2 knockout results in markedly reduced pancreas size and cellularity without overtly impacting endocrine or exocrine function. In genetically engineered cancer models, single Got loss does not impact lesion formation, tumor size, animal survival, or the composition of the tumor microenvironment. Identical results were also observed in orthotopic allograft mouse models. Together, these findings add to a growing body of work illustrating the adaptability of metabolism in cancer. They also emphasize the importance of model selection, the use of multiple independent models, and the in vivo context when studying the role of metabolic programs in cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating multi-omics and clinical features to model survival in epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Raghda E Eldesouki, Omar Tarek, Hassan Morsi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exhibits significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, influenced by histology, age, stage, and molecular characteristics. This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive model integrating demographic, clinical, and molecular data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to predict two-year survival outcomes in EOC. The cohort included 2,427 patients with Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma (EA)s and Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (SC) , of whom 1,011 had gene data. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated for predictive performance. SVM provided the optimal balance of mortality-class detection and overall performance. While GBC achieved the highest ROC-AUC (0.81), SVM demonstrated superior recall for mortality cases (0.70 vs. 0.61), which was prioritized given our clinical objective. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analyses revealed that WT1, HOXA11, TPM4, TMPRSS2, MUC16, SDHD, and MYC were the most influential predictors of mortality, along with age at diagnosis. Differential gene expression and enrichment analyses identified distinct age- and stage-associated molecular profiles, with genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor microenvironment, and growth factor signaling showing significant upregulation. Mutational analyses revealed histology-specific patterns, with TP53, PIK3CA, and ZFHX3 highly mutated in SC, while PTEN and ARID1A were more prevalent in EA. Several mutations, including TP53, FAT3, and FAT4 in EA, and CSMD3 in SC, were associated with poorer survival. Integrating multivariate predictive modeling with biological interpretation provides a comprehensive framework for personalized risk stratification and treatment decision-making in EOC. The identified prognostic biomarkers, such as TPM4, SDHD, MUC16, and BCL6, represent potential targets for future studies and therapeutic interventions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A novel prognostic model for lung squamous cell carcinoma based on multi-omics analysis and machine learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jian Li, Zengqiang Shen, +1 author, Jun Ma</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play a crucial role in the immune response and significantly influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic and immunological implications of TLS-associated molecular subtypes in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, we applied 10 multi-omics integration strategies to perform a multi-omics analysis of the mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, and genomic mutation data of 39 TLSs-related genes, along with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles, to generate integrated consensus subtypes of LUSC. Four molecular subtypes were identified: cancer subtype 1 (CS1), CS2, CS3, and CS4. We observed a significant difference in overall survival between cancer subtype 1 (CS1) and CS3. Subsequently, we identified 33 prognosis-related genes based on differential expression between CS1 and CS3, which were further refined to 20 genes using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and constructed a prognostic signature termed the LUSC-Survival Prediction Index (LUSCSPI). The high-LUSCSPI group demonstrated a poor prognosis and was more likely to benefit from treatment with nine chemotherapeutic agents (shikonin, doxorubicin, CMK, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, paclitaxel, DMOG, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and crizotinib). In contrast, the low-LUSCSPI group exhibited a more favorable prognosis, with thapsigargin and cisplatin identified as promising treatment options. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of LUSCSPI as an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. Further, the multi-omics consensus approach provides a robust foundation for prognostic stratification in LUSC patients, facilitating personalized treatment and disease management.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Ahtisham Fazeel Abbasi, Muhammad Sajjad, +2 authors, Andreas Dengel</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer molecular subtype classification is an essential component of precision oncology which provides insights into cancer prognosis and guides targeted therapy. Despite the growing applications of AI for cancer molecular subtype classification, challenges persist due to non-standardized dataset configurations, diverse omics modalities, and inconsistent evaluation measures. These issues limit the comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability of AI classifiers across different cancers and hinder the development of robust and accurate AI-driven tools. This study performs comparative analyses of 35 unique AI classifiers across 153 datasets, covering 8 omics modalities and 20 different cancers. Particularly, it investigates 6 different research questions, and based on comprehensive performance analyses of the 35 AI classifiers it elucidates the research questions with the following answers: (i) out of 17 different configurations for 5 out of the 8 tested omics modalities, RPPA (RPPA), Gistic2-all-data-by-genes (CNV), HM27 (Meth), and HiSeqV2-exon (Exon) configurations consistently yield better performance; (ii) in terms of 8 omics modalities, RNASeq, miRNA, CNV, and Exon generally achieve higher macro-accuracy (MACC) compared to Meth., Array, SNP and RPPA; (iii) SNP and RPPA modalities are prone to biases due to technical noise; (iv) traditional machine learning (ML) models (SVM, XGB, HGB) perform best on small and low-dimensional datasets, while deep learning (DL) models (ResNet18, CNN, NN, MLP) excel on large and high-dimensional datasets; (v) SVM achieves the highest mean MACC across all classifiers, with NN, ResNet18, DEEPGENE, and MLP also demonstrate strong performance; and (vi) DL classifiers show superior MACC as compared to ML classifiers in 12 out of 20 cancers. The findings offer key insights to guide the development of standardized, robust, and efficient AI-driven pipelines for cancer molecular subtype classification. This study enhances reproducibility and facilitates better comparison across AI methods, ultimately advancing precision oncology.</p>
