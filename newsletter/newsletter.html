<h2 class="paper-title">antigen-prime: Simulating coupled genetic and antigenic evolution of influenza virus</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Thornton, Z. T., Tran, T., +4 authors, Haddox, H. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seasonal influenza virus undergoes rapid antigenic drift to escape population immunity. Computational methods can be used to organize viral genetic diversity into antigenically similar variants and estimate variant-specific growth rates. However, benchmarking these methods is challenging because it can be di[ffi]cult to accurately quantify antigenicity and growth rates in nature. Simulating viral evolution using defined selective pressures can provide ground-truth data for benchmarking. But, existing simulators do not link genetic sequences to antigenic phenotypes under selection from host populations. Here, we present a forward-time epidemic simulator called antigen-prime that links these factors. We use it to simulate viral evolution over 30 years and validate the simulation recapitulates genetic and antigenic patterns observed in natural influenza evolution. We then use the simulated data to benchmark methods for assigning variants and estimating their growth rates. We evaluated a sequence-based and a phylogenetics-based method for variant assignment, finding the former was slightly more e[ff]ective at separating viruses into antigenically distinct groups. We also evaluated methods for estimating variant growth rates in one-year sliding windows. Estimates were accurate in most windows, but highly inaccurate in several others. Examining high- error windows revealed several examples of a previously unreported failure mode. In all, antigen-prime provides a simulation framework to benchmark models of influenza evolution, and could be used to help guide future development of these models. The source code is openly available at https://github.com/matsengrp/antigen-prime.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NanoSimFormer: An end-to-end Transformer-based simulator for nanopore sequencing signal data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xie, S., Ding, L., +1 author, Zhu, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanopore sequencing has achieved a new standard of accuracy with the advent of R10.4.1 flow cell and high-performance Transformer-based basecalling models. However, existing signal simulators often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dynamics of nanopore current signals, relying on static pore models or lacking optimization objectives linked to basecalling, resulting in synthetic signals with substantially lower accuracy and fidelity than experimental data. To address this, we introduce NanoSimFormer, an end-to-end Transformer-based signal simulator that integrates basecaller guidance during training to generate high-fidelity nanopore signals explicitly optimized for accurate calling. Rigorous evaluation across diverse human, bacterial, and fungal R10.4.1 DNA sequencing datasets demonstrates that NanoSimFormer consistently outperformed competing methods (seq2squiggle and Squigulator), achieving median read accuracies exceeding 99% and Q-scores above 22.8, closely matching experimental baselines. NanoSimFormer faithfully recapitulated experimental variant calling performance on the human HG002 sample, achieving F1-scores of 0.9967 for SNPs and 0.8295 for small indels, and notably minimized false-positive errors in homopolymer and short tandem repeat (STR) regions where other simulators struggled. Furthermore, NanoSimFormer-derived reads enabled high-quality de novo bacterial assembly with consensus error rates below one mismatch per 100 kbp, comparable to experimental assemblies, and preserved fungal mock community structures with high correlation to experimental abundance profiles in metagenomic benchmarks. With tunable parameters for amplitude noise and event duration variance, NanoSimFormer enables the simulation of datasets spanning a wide range of data qualities. Together, these results establish NanoSimFormer as a robust tool for benchmarking and algorithm development in the latest nanopore sequencing era.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Surf2Spot: A Surface-Informed Geometry-Aware Model for Predicting Binder and Nanobody Design Hotspots</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhao, A., Li, Y., +8 authors, Wang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and nanobody-antigen interactions (NAIs) play essential roles in cellular function, yet accurate hotspot prediction remains challenging. We present Surf2Spot, a deep learning framework that integrates sequence embeddings, structural features, and protein surface properties to predict interaction hotspots. By jointly modeling structural and physicochemical determinants, Surf2Spot achieves superior performance on curated PPI and NAI datasets, improving F1-scores by 45.9-46.9% and AUPRC by 43.2% over existing methods. Case studies on NbPDS1 and VdPDA1 demonstrate that Surf2Spot accurately recovers experimentally validated hotspots clustered within functional domains. When incorporated into binder design pipelines (RFdiffusion and BindCraft), Surf2Spot-guided designs yielded a 4-fold increase in successful design throughput and enhanced binding affinities compared to baseline strategies. These results establish Surf2Spot as a powerful tool for hotspot discovery and rational protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RLBWT-Based LCP Computation in Compressed Space for Terabase-Scale Pangenome Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sanaullah, A., Brown, N. K., +5 authors, Zhang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lossless full text indexes are utilized in a myriad of applications in bioinformatics. The continuously decreasing cost of generating biological data has resulted in the need to build full text indexes on biological datasets of increasing size. Many compressed full text indexes have been developed to address this problem. In particular, run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT) based compressed full text indexes have seen wide development and adoption. However, the construction of these RLBWT-based compressed full text indexes is still computationally expensive, sometimes prohibitively so, even for current dataset sizes. Therefore, we present algorithms for the construction of RLBWT-based compressed full text indexes and their supporting data structures in compressed space. The algorithms have a space complexity of O(r) words and run in O(n) time for repetitive datasets, where r is the number of runs in the BWT, n is the length of the text, and repetitive datasets implies the average run length is at least log n. We provide the first algorithm to compute LCP-related information for repetitive datasets in optimal time and O(r) space, greatly reducing memory requirements. The key idea behind this algorithm is the utilization of r samples of the inverse suffix array at regular intervals. For example, on the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Release 2 dataset, this reduces peak memory from 2,135 GiB to 170 GiB (12.6x reduction) compared to the previous best method (pfp-thresholds).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mitochondria-nucleus communication dictates progressive versus bimodal aging of the mammary gland.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jenkins, E. C., Chattopadhyay, M., +5 authors, Germain, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-linear aging, identified through oscillations in human plasma proteomics around 44 and 60, is postulated to contribute to the onset of diseases. Incidence of breast cancer follows such bimodal pattern. We show that mitochondria-nucleus matching in mice results in two mammary gland aging patterns, including a bimodal pattern associated with susceptibility to mammary tumor and that this bimodal signature is enriched in breast cancer patients diagnosed at 45 and 65.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CRISPR-enabled genetic screens identify synthetic lethal targets across frequently altered cancer drivers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Desjardins, J., Bowlan, J., +22 authors, Young, J. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic lethality (SL) provides a treatment paradigm for targeting cancer with alterations in driver genes that are not conventionally druggable, including loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in tumor suppressor genes and gain-of-function (GoF) alterations in oncogenes. We undertook a series of genome-wide CRISPR screens using functionally validated isogenic cell lines and also conducted a large-scale SL analysis using data from the cancer dependency map (DepMap). We charted SL interactions across 15 genetic alterations characteristic of diseases with high incidence and unmet clinical need: FBXW7, CCNE1, CDK12, ARID1A, KMT2D, DNMT3A, TET2, KEAP1, STK11, IDH1, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, chromosome 18q loss, and chromosome 13q loss. We show validation of several SL interactions between tractable targets with cancer drivers, including ARID1A and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway aminotransferase GFPT1, STK11 with CAMK protein kinase family members including MARK2, FBXW7 and the CDK1 regulatory kinase PKMYT1, and CCNE1 amplification and the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). In summary, this study offers a rich resource of genetic interactions across cancer drivers enabling the discovery of new biological insights and drug targets for future therapeutic development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres and CINSARC are interconnected toward non-translocation-related sarcomas progression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Perot, G., Guerriau, C., +6 authors, Chibon, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere elongation mechanism activated during oncogenesis and primarily acting in tumors of mesenchymal origin. Although the proteins involved in the machinery enabling ALT to elongate telomeres are becoming better understood, the underlying biology of this mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we took advantage of a fully characterized cohort of 98 leiomyosarcomas (LMS) from the French Sarcoma Group to further our understanding of the ALT mechanism. We first compared the transcriptomic profiles of ALT+ and TERT+ LMS and demonstrated a strong enrichment of the CINSARC signature in ALT+ tumors. The establishment of an ALT+-related signature in these LMS confirmed the close association between CINSARC and ALT in two additional cohorts of non-translocation-related sarcomas. In vitro mesenchymal models of spontaneous ALT induction showed increased CINSARC expression following acquisition of the ALT mechanism. Conversely, ALT inactivation, through BLM inhibition, led to decreased CINSARC expression. These results establish CINSARC as a new hallmark of the ALT mechanism in non-translocation-related sarcomas and demonstrate the association of a cellular biological process with the CINSARC prognostic signature, namely the ALT mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Phosphoproteomic profiling reveals signaling pathways modulated by Annona muricata leaf extract in oral adenosquamous carcinoma cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Najar, M. A., Rex, D. A. B., +2 authors, Dagamajalu, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phosphorylation driven dysregulation of intracellular signaling networks is a central feature of cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Although Annona muricata leaf extracts have demonstrated anticancer activity across multiple experimental models, the underlying molecular mechanisms particularly at the level of phosphorylation dependent signaling remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a tandem mass tag TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach to systematically characterize signaling alterations induced by methanolic Annona muricataleaf extract (AME) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) CAL-27 cells. Functional assays revealed that AME significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and clonogenic survival. Global phosphoproteomic profiling identified 6,362 phosphopeptides corresponding to 1,964 unique phosphorylation sites across nearly 7,000 phosphoproteins. AME treatment induced widespread, time-dependent hypophosphorylation, indicating a coordinated suppression of oncogenic signaling networks. Pathway and network analyses revealed marked inhibition of signaling pathways associated with key oncogenic kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and signaling modules linked to EGFR and mTOR pathways. Kinase-substrate enrichment and kinome mapping further demonstrated reduced inferred activity of CDK and MAPK driven signaling, accompanied by suppression of cell cycle progression, mitosis, and checkpoint regulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that AME induces systems-level remodeling of phosphorylation dependent signaling networks, enforcing a growth-restrictive cellular state in OSCC cells. This study highlights quantitative phosphoproteomics as a powerful strategy for dissecting natural product mediated regulation of oncogenic signaling and provides mechanistic insight into the anticancer potential of Annona muricata.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Ruiz Moreno, C., Collot, R., van den Broek, T. J. M., +12 authors, Stunnenberg, H. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are highly aggressive brain tumors with no effective therapies. Limited understanding of their tumor microenvironment has hindered the identification of targetable cell-cell dependencies driving tumor growth. Here, we generate pHGGmap, an integrative multimodal atlas of over 800,000 cells from 136 patients profiled across single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic, and spatial modalities. We identify novel cancer cell states defined by developmental and context-responsive programs and uncover robust cancer-myeloid interactions that organize the tumor ecosystem. Distinct myeloid immunomodulatory programs align with specific cancer cell states, revealing three conserved multicellular niches across patients and treatment. One conserved stem-like-enriched niche couples disseminating radial glial-like (RG-like) cancer cells with complement-enriched macrophages, indicative of cellular co-option supporting invasion. Longitudinal profiling of a metastatic pHGG case further supports RG-like cells as the dominant disseminating population and demonstrates a preserved association with complement-enriched macrophages even outside the brain. Our findings highlight a stable cancer-myeloid dependency and therapeutic vulnerability. Importantly, therapeutic reprogramming of this niche restores immune activation and promotes targeting of highly invasive RG-like cells. Together, pHGGmap reveals targetable cancer-myeloid dependencies in pHGG and provides a foundation for translational discovery.</p>
