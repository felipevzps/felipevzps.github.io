<h2 class="paper-title">Context-Dependent Protein Structure Prediction Analysis and Stoichiometry Inference with MultimerMapper</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rodriguez Araya, E., SERRA, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed the field of protein structure, notably with the accuracy level reached by AlphaFold in the prediction of monomeric and multimeric protein structures. However, while cloud implementations have broadened access to these methods, there is still a lack of non-AI tools to systematically interpret and analyze the resulting data, especially under varying modeling contexts. Here, we present MultimerMapper, a pipeline and software suite designed to extract, integrate, analyze, and visualize the behavior of multimeric systems in ensembles of overlapping protein structure predictions. It utilizes statistics and graph theory, combined with novel approaches, to interpret how protein-protein interfaces and protein conformation behave across different modeling contexts. Starting from a list of input sequences, MultimerMapper guides users through the generation and interpretation of structure prediction ensembles. It produces interactive 2D and 3D visualizations, highlights higher-order subassemblies, infers probable stoichiometries, and identifies alternative interaction modes and conformational changes associated with the presence or absence of specific proteins. MultimerMapper is cross-platform, freely available, and easily integrates with existing workflows. It offers a new perspective on the dynamic nature of predicted protein complexes, supporting researchers in the exploration of functional mechanisms and assembly paths.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Li, J., Erichsen, B., +5 authors, Nielsen, A. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning holds great promise for accelerating enzyme optimization, but its power is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of sequence-fitness data. Here, we introduce MillionFull, a low-cost method that enables high-throughput full-length sequence-fitness mapping for enzymes of arbitrary length. Each run yields on the order of 10^5 - 10^7; data points, capturing sequence-function relationships at unprecedented scale. By overcoming the data bottleneck, MillionFull provides a foundation for dramatically advancing AI-driven enzyme engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A high throughput flow cytometry assay for quantifying type 3 secretion system assembly in Salmonella</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Summers, J. S., Ming Liang, J., +1 author, Tullman-Ercek, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recombinant protein production in bacteria is limited by costly cell lysis and multi-step purification. To bypass these limitations, leveraging native bacterial secretion systems to secrete proteins offers a promising alternative. The type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can secrete proteins at hundreds of milligrams per liter. While promising, higher titers from this and other natural systems are needed to be relevant commercially. A major engineering target to enhance protein secretion is the T3SS secretion apparatus. However, efforts to quantify its assembly are hindered by bottlenecks in scalability and complexity. Assembly involves ~20 structural proteins forming with precise stoichiometry under dynamic regulation. Membrane- and periplasmic-embedded components are difficult to probe without costly, time-intensive methods. To fully realize the T3SS as a tool for scalable protein production, new tools are needed for rapid and accurate characterization of the assembled apparatus. Here, we establish a high throughput flow cytometry method in S. Typhimurium by quantifying the abundance of the needle-bound tip protein SipD as a proxy for T3SS apparatus assembly. We then adapted a super resolution microscopy method, known as Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM), to visualize the presence of SipD and validate the flow cytometry results. Applying this approach, we revealed how overexpression of key T3SS regulators hilA and hilD impact assembly, expanded the assay with a secretion-compatible fluorescent reporter to link assembly with secretion, and uncovered how a PrgI variant impacts apparatus architecture. Together, these tools enable rapid insights into T3SS assembly and advance heterologous secretion platform development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GRASS-NB: Group-structured variable selection for spatial negative binomial data with applications to cancer registry and spatial omics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mattila, C., Neelon, B., +4 authors, Seal, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatially structured, overdispersed count data with high-dimensional predictors are increasingly observed across studies from population-level epidemiology to cellular-level spatial omics. Feature selection is critical to identify influential predictors, such as key risk factors or biomarkers. Few Bayesian studies have assessed negative binomial regression (NBR) models with standard variable selection priors, like the mixture spike-and-slab (SS) or continuous horseshoe (HS), but mostly under aspatial settings. Features often form groups; for instance, in population surveys, caloric intake and physical activity may fall under "Diet &amp; Exercise", while cigarette use and smoking laws belong to "Smoking". We propose a flexible NBR model that accommodates spatial autocorrelation and introduces a novel group-structured prior by hybridizing SS and HS shrinkage. The model's performance with different priors is evaluated in terms of specificity, precision, and computational cost under challenging scenarios, including "large p, small n" cases. We further apply the model to CDC state-level cancer data, comprising demographic, screening, and behavioral covariates, to identify key drivers and population-level risk factors, and to a melanoma spatial omics dataset for predictive modeling of gene expression. An efficient R package is provided on GitHub.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A blueprint for mutation-defined hallmark vulnerabilities across human cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, R., Gil, R. S., +7 authors, Feng, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hallmark gene mutations shape cancer cell vulnerabilities and inform drug discovery. A systematic map of hallmark gene mutation-defined cancer dependencies and therapeutic responses is essential to uncover novel targets and refine therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first pan-cancer blueprint of hallmark vulnerabilities, systematically linking hallmark gene mutation markers to cancer cell dependencies and drug sensitivities across 22 cancer cohorts. We integrated multi-omics data from patient tumours with large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens and pharmacologic profiling of over a thousand cancer cell lines. Our analysis revealed the cancer type-specific nature of hallmark gene expression programs, uncovered previously unrecognised mutation-target gene dependencies, and highlighted metabolic programs as a dominant class of functional vulnerabilities. Notably, we identified oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) addiction in CDKN2A-loss lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and experimentally validated this dependency. Our validation highlights the greater selectivity of CDKN2A-loss LUSC cells to metformin, an FDA-approved antidiabetic drug known for its OXPHOS inhibitory activity. Proteogenomic integration further prioritised targets overexpressed in mutant tumours, constituting therapeutic windows. Pharmacologic profiling identified both oncology and non-oncology agents with selective activity in mutation-defined subgroups, revealing opportunities for drug repurposing. Our machine learning framework, Comet-X, for the first time fully leveraged gene mutation combinations to predict these target dependencies and drug responses. The resulting pan-cancer mutation-dependency map provides a comprehensive resource of hallmark gene targets and candidate therapeutics, stratified by mutation markers, to pave the way for drug development, clinical trial design and discovery research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">STING activation reshapes the tumor microenvironment leading to tumor regression in osteosarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Young, E. P., Johnson, C. A., +14 authors, Sweet-Cordero, E. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Osteosarcomas are characterized by a high degree of aneuploidy, chromothripsis and micronuclei, yet these tumors typically have an immunosuppressive, macrophage-rich, T-cell depleted tumor microenvironment. cGAS-STING dysregulation is a possible mechanism by which immune activation in response to tumor genomic instability could be repressed. We identified almost universal repression of cGAS or STING in human osteosarcomas. However, a STING-activation gene signature was predictive of survival in osteosarcoma patients suggesting potential for activation of this pathway in the osteosarcoma tumor microenvironment. Indeed, in immunocompetent osteosarcoma models, systemic STING agonism led to complete regression and induced lasting immunologic memory. Host STING activation is sufficient to promote this anti-tumor immunity even in the absence of tumor STING. These results nominate the cGAS-STING pathway as an important therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, a disease in which no new curative therapies have been developed in the last 40 years.</p>
