<h2 class="paper-title">Detection of Somatic Point Mutations Directly from Spatial Transcriptomics Enables in vivo Spatiotemporal Lineage Tracing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, Z., Yao, M., +23 authors, Dou, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics reveals tissue organization but lacks in vivo lineage-tracing methods applicable to humans. We introduce SpaceTracer, a computational framework that accurately detects somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) directly from spatial transcriptomics data. By leveraging naturally occurring somatic SNVs, SpaceTracer reconstructs cellular phylogenies within native tissue architecture, enabling the mapping of lineage spread, migration, lineage-coupled expression changes and lineage-aware local interactions. Applied to human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, it traced tumor initiation and progressions, uncovered widespread pre-invasive migration of dedifferentiated epithelial cells and characterized mutant B cells migrating from tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) into the tumor boundary. The framework also reconstructed developmental lineages across multiple tissues and identified tissue-resident mutant immune cells. SpaceTracer thus provides a perturbation-free platform for high-resolution spatiotemporal lineage tracing, offering a transformative tool for elucidating complex biological systems--especially tumor-immune ecosystems--with direct implications for advancing cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">IDTrack: Time- and Namespace-Aware Identifier Harmonization for Reproducible Workflows</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Inecik, K., Erken, E., Theis, F. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reproducibility in computational biology fails silently when gene identifiers drift beneath unchanged analysis code: the same frozen pipeline, rerun months later, yields different results not because biology evolved but because identifier semantics shifted with upstream annotation releases; a failure mode invisible to version control and containerization because the mapping layer itself constitutes an undeclared coordinate system whose time axis advances independently of downstream workflows. Gene identifiers occupy positions in a joint space of namespace, annotation release, genome assembly, and entity layer that evolves through retirements, merges, splits, and nomenclature reassignments, so atlas integration, retrospective reanalysis, and perturbation screens inherit temporal dependencies that existing utilities cannot surface: current mappers answer what an identifier resolves to now rather than under what declared contract the feature space was constructed. IDTrack reconceptualizes identifier harmonization as a time-indexed coordinate transformation by materializing annotation release history into a snapshot-bounded identifier graph and solving conversions through a time-traveling, contract-constrained pathfinder that pins release boundaries, assembly contexts, and ambiguity policies as explicit parameters rather than implicit endpoint state. This architecture surfaces reachability and ambiguity as interpretable outcome classes (unmapped, uniquely resolved, or ambiguously multi-target) enables atlas-scale harmonization with explicit collision handling, and records every mapping decision in a provenance ledger that transforms invisible preprocessing into citable methodological infrastructure whose coordinate choices can be inspected, compared, and reproduced rather than lost as ephemeral preprocessing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Distributional and Centile Calibration of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Normative Models as Training Sample Sizes Increase to 40,000 Subjects</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Villalon Reina, J. E., Feng, Y., +7 authors, Thompson, P. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Normative modeling (NM) is a powerful framework for quantifying individual deviations in brain structure and function relative to a population reference. However, its clinical utility depends on well-calibrated models trained on heterogeneous datasets such as those found in neuroimaging. Here, we systematically examine the effect of training sample size on the distributional and centile calibration of hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR)-based NMs. Using multisite 3D diffusion MRI scans of the brain from 54,583 subjects, spanning almost the entire lifespan (age: 4-91 years), we trained NMs of white matter fractional anisotropy, a key microstructural metric, on subsamples ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 subjects. HBR was modeled with a Sinh-Arcsinh likelihood. Model calibration was evaluated using Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to assess distributional agreement of Z-scores with the standard normal distribution; we also used Mean Absolute Centile Error (MACE) to quantify centile accuracy. Both metrics showed consistent and substantial improvements as the training sample size increased, indicating reduced posterior uncertainty and improved estimation of distributional parameters, particularly at the centile extremes. These results demonstrate that large training cohorts are essential for well calibrated NMs derived from heterogeneous neuroimaging data and highlight the importance of large-scale data aggregation for reliable individual-level inference.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PanACRpred: Predicting Accessible Chromatin Regions in Pangenomes using Motif Chaining</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Warr, M. J., Dinh, T., +6 authors, Mumey, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we investigate whether motif subsequence features can predict accessible chromatin regions (ACR) in a genome, i.e. regions that are accessible to regulatory proteins, thus enabling transcription of associated genes. We focus on plants, whose agricultural and ecological importance make them interesting and important organisms to study, and whose complex genomes provide important stress tests for our algorithm. We show that regulatory motif sequence similarity can be found efficiently using co-linear chaining. The similarity scores found are then used as features in machine learning models to explore the feasibility of effectively predicting ACRs in genome assemblies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu-Swetz, Y., Tan, S., +1 author, Wang, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Population-scalable genotyping from low-coverage sequencing data using pangenome graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bolognini, D., Guarracino, A., +6 authors, Soranzo, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pangenome-based genotyping of structurally complex loci remains challenging at low sequencing depths, particularly when samples are of low quality, such as in ancient DNA. We present COSIGT (COsine SImilarity-based GenoTyper), a method that infers structural genotypes by matching short-read coverage patterns to pangenome haplotypes using cosine similarity. COSIGT maintains robust accuracy at low coverage (1-2X), outperforming existing methods where depth-sensitive approaches degrade. We demonstrate scalability to thousands of modern and ancient genomes, enabling population-scale analyses of complex variation from low-coverage data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Macro-Equi-Diff (MED): Scaffold-based Macrocycles Generation Using Equivariant Diffusion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kambampati, S. S., Anumandla, S., +3 authors, Kondaparthi, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Macrocyclic compounds are essential in drug discovery as they can modulate protein-protein interactions and enhance selectivity. Their structural complexity enables access to molecular diversity beyond traditional small molecules; however, designing feasible macrocycles remains a challenging task. Current computational methods often fail to generate macrocycles with proper drug-like properties. Here, we present Macro-Equi-Diff (MED), a deep learning framework that combines transformer-based site identification with an E(3)-equivariant Diffusion Model (EDM) for linker creation, and a fragment-linker attachment module. MED transforms acyclic molecules into structurally consistent macrocycles. MED was tested on the ZINC dataset, achieving high validity (93.92%), uniqueness (99.94%), macrocyclization (99.92%), and linker novelty (82.81%). MED improves upon previous methods that lack a macrocyclic geometry context. As a case study, MED was used to macrocyclize four acyclic drugs targeting the JAK2 protein. The generated macrocycles exhibited favourable molecular descriptors and strong binding affinities, establishing MED as a reliable method for expanding the macrocyclic chemical space.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SIP-BERT: A multi-organism deep strategy for predicting self interaction in proteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chakraborty, T., Majumder, S., +3 authors, Basu, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Self interacting proteins (SIPs) are critical to cellular regulation, yet their experimental identification remains challenging due to high costs, inefficiencies, and frequent false positives. Leveraging recent advances in deep language models, we introduce SIP BERT, a family of lightweight transformer based models trained on organism-specific self interaction datasets curated from existing protein protein interaction databases. We developed three variants: SIP BERT(H), SIP BERT(Y), and SIP BERT(HY) trained on human, yeast, and combined datasets, respectively. These models significantly outperform existing methods, exceeding baseline accuracies by 18%, 8% and 15% respectively. SIP BERT models also generalise effectively to under-annotated organisms such as the mouse and the fruit fly, achieving high recall despite minimal labeled data. Furthermore, structural analysis of predicted false positives using PDB derived alpha carbon distance maps reveals close spatial residue proximities, suggesting plausible but undocumented self interactions. These results highlight the potential of SIP BERT to uncover novel SIPs and expand our understanding of protein self interaction across diverse species. The dataset and the developed models are available at https://github.com/CMATERJU-BIOINFO/SIP-BERT for academic use only.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AncientMetagenomeDir dating metadataset highlights need for standardised radiocarbon reporting in ancient DNA</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hearne, K., Spurite, D., +37 authors, Zampirolo, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ancient DNA is a valuable data source for the understanding of our past. However, to effectively interpret this data, it is essential to know the age of the samples from which the DNA is obtained. Although the field of palaeogenomics has been recognised for its robust open data sharing practices, dating information associated with analysed samples is not reported consistently across palaeogenomic studies, nor is it included as metadata in most genetic data repositories. Here, we describe the addition of standardised precise dating information for ancient microbial genomes into the AncientMetagenomeDir metadata repository of published ancient metagenomic samples. This extension currently includes dating information for over 700 ancient microbial genomic datasets, of which 333 are dated using historical, contextual, or stratigraphic methods, and 405 are radiocarbon dated. We quantitatively assess the quality of radiocarbon date reporting and find that, despite established reporting conventions, radiocarbon dating information is often reported inconsistently across ancient metagenomic studies. This new resource provides ancient microbial researchers with standardised dating information that facilitates more accurate and consistent analysis of metagenomic sequencing data. The dataset also highlights the need for greater standardisation of radiocarbon date reporting in original publications in order to allow effective reuse of this and future ancient microbial data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PhyloSOLID: Robust phylogeny reconstruction from single-cell data despite inherent error and sparsity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, Q., Liu, Y., +10 authors, Dou, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While lineage tracing based on somatic mutations in single-cell sequencing data offers a powerful approach to reconstructing cellular histories in vivo, its reliability is fundamentally limited by pervasive technical artifacts--specifically, high error rates and data sparsity. These issues introduce false phylogenetic signals that corrupt tree topology and lead to spurious evolutionary conclusions. To overcome these limitations, we present PhyloSOLID, a phylogenetic algorithm designed to be inherently robust to these data imperfections. PhyloSOLID employs a progressive scaffolding strategy that begins with graph-based construction of a low-resolution, high-confidence backbone tree from reliable and uniformly covered mutations. This scaffold is then refined through the iterative integration of remaining data, guided by a Bayesian statistical model that penalizes phylogenetic inconsistencies to effectively separate the true evolutionary signal from technical artifacts. Benchmarking on both simulated datasets and multiple ground-truth datasets demonstrates that PhyloSOLID achieves superior lineage reconstruction accuracy over existing methods, for both single-cell RNA-seq and DNA-seq data. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface enables customized quality assessment, artifact removal, and interpretation of lineage structures. PhyloSOLID provides a powerful solution for decoding cellular evolution in developmental and disease contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine Learning-Based Multi-Omics Integration for Identification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Biomarkers in an Egyptian Cohort.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rency S Varghese, Xinran Zhang, +2 authors, Habtom W Ressom</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most common causes of cancer-related deaths globally. The high incidence of HCC is largely linked to chronic hepatitis virus infections, liver cirrhosis, and exposure to carcinogenic substances. Egypt has one of the world's highest burdens of HCC, with liver cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as the primary risk factor. Malignant conversion of cirrhosis to HCC is often fatal in part because adequate biomarkers are not available for diagnosis of HCC in the early stage. Therefore, there is a critical need for more effective biomarkers to detect HCC at an early stage, when therapeutic intervention is more likely to be successful. Multiomics integration has emerged as a powerful strategy to uncover biomarkers and better understand the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases such as HCC. This study summarizes findings from multiple untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry-based analyses of proteins, N-linked glycans, and metabolites performed on blood samples from HCC cases and cirrhotic cohorts recruited in Egypt. Integrative analysis using machine learning methods is performed to identify a panel of multiomics features that differentiates HCC cases from the high-risk population of cirrhotic patients with liver cirrhosis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of lung cancer and is difficult to distinguish from benign pulmonary nodules (BPNs), particularly at early stages. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a promising source of biomarkers for the diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules. This study aimed to identify robust and clinically relevant EV-based protein biomarkers via isolation with EXODUS, a system that enables efficient direct capture of plasma EVs, followed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for in-depth proteomic profiling. A total of 1383 proteins were identified from the plasma EVs obtained from 25 individuals (10 BPN and 15 early stage LUAD), while dysregulated protein signatures were revealed through differential expression analysis. Machine learning algorithms incorporating demographic variables, imaging features, EV protein profiles, and conventional tumor markers were applied to select diagnostic candidates. Random forest analysis revealed two upregulated proteins, NTN3 and APOA4, as promising biomarkers. Subsequently, their diagnostic performance and net clinical benefits were validated in an independent EV cohort (6 LUAD and 6 BPN) using ELISAs and decision curve analysis. In summary, we present an integrated pipeline that combines EXODUS-based isolation, DIA-MS, and machine learning to detect markers from plasma EVs for distinguishing early stage lung cancer from benign nodules.</p>
