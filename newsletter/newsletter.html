<h2 class="paper-title">scLong: a billion-parameter foundation model for capturing long-range gene context in single-cell transcriptomics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ding Bai, Shentong Mo, +13 authors, Eric Xing</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity by providing gene expression data at single-cell resolution, uncovering insights into rare cell populations, cell-cell interactions, and gene regulation. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets have shown great promise in analyzing such data, but existing approaches are often limited to modeling a small subset of highly expressed genes and lack the integration of external gene-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we present scLong, a billion-parameter foundation model pretrained on 48 million cells. scLong performs self-attention across the entire set of 28,000 genes in the human genome. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies between all genes, including lowly expressed ones (containing unexpressed genes with zero expressions), which often play critical roles in cellular processes but are typically excluded by existing foundation models. Additionally, scLong integrates gene knowledge from the Gene Ontology using a graph convolutional network, enriching its contextual understanding of gene functions and relationships. In extensive evaluations, scLong surpasses both state-of-the-art scRNA-seq foundation models and task-specific models across diverse tasks, including predicting transcriptional responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, forecasting cancer drug responses, and inferring gene regulatory networks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Multiscale Model of Collective Decision-Making in Hybrid Aspen Tree Tissues Describes Bud-Dormancy Break</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dromiack, H., Khanapurkar, S., +8 authors, Walker, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mechanisms underlying cellular coordination within tissues remain enigmatic. Most models focus on interactions between just two levels of organization - cell and tissue - and do not leverage data across deeper hierarchies that best represent living processes, with many spatial and temporal scales interacting. Integrating many scales, from molecular to cellular to tissular to organismal to populational, may be necessary to fully elucidate tissue function, especially in cases of sparse data at each level. Here, we investigate multiscale, robust regulation of tissue-level decision-making, using experimental studies of cold induced dormancy release in terminal buds of hybrid aspen trees as our case study. We develop a network model of terminal bud meristematic tissue, incorporating expression data from a key cold induced regulator gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT1), which controls bud dormancy release, combined with data on variability in cell-to-cell communication controlled by FT1 mediated regulation of plasmodesmata. The model can explain dormancy breaking under constant temperature, but not variable temperature. We introduce constraints from organismal-level data and show how the presence of coordinated cellular interactions within individual plant tissues is necessary to reproduce data of population-level statistics. Our findings demonstrate how mechanisms of tissue function may be better constrained when data are used across more scales. They also hint at potential tantalizing new insights such as how tissue function might not be solely dictated bottom-up from molecular interactions, but also top-down from constraints imposed by the organismal and population context. Both implications illustrate the critical importance of incorporating cross-scale information processing in modeling biological decision-making.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Nested birth-death processes are competitive with parameter-heavy neural networks as time-dependent models of protein evolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Large, A., Holmes, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most statistical phylogenetics analyses use relatively simple continuous-time finite-state Markov models of point substitution to describe molecular evolution, often keeping sequence length fixed, ignoring insertions and deletions (indels) entirely, and making little (if any) allowance for variations in selection pressure due to interactions between amino acids. The simplistic assumptions of these models limit the realism of phylogenetics. We extend the TKF92 model - the canonical hierarchical model combining an outer birth-death process for indels with an inner finite-state Markov chain for substitutions - by introducing additional nesting and latent states, allowing for structural heterogeneity. We compare these TKF92 extensions (which are derived as exact solutions of instantaneous processes, and in which evolutionary time naturally appears as a matrix exponential coefficient) to two classes of neural seq2seq model that are not derived in such a way, but instead take evolutionary time as an input feature: the first class of model being constrained to enforce a TKF92-like structure, and the second lacking any such constraint. We evaluate the per-character perplexities of all models on splits of the PFam database of aligned protein domains. A nested TKF-based model with only 32,000 parameters is highly competitive with neural networks containing tens of millions of parameters, outperforming all but two of the neural architectures tested. Our results indicate that approaches grounded in molecular evolutionary theory may be more parameter-efficient and provide a better fit to real alignments than unconstrained alternatives, supporting the incorporation of CTMC-based model structure within future neural phylogenetic approaches.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Designing protein/non-protein binding interactions using a full-atom diffusion model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kundert, K., Church, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> An unresolved challenge in the field of computational protein design is to create proteins that bind non-protein partners, e.g. DNA, RNA, and small molecules. Most machine learning (ML) algorithms for protein design can only work with systems composed entirely of amino acids, and therefore cannot be directly applied to this task. The few algorithms that accommodate non-proteins still represent amino acids differently than other molecules, and therefore cannot easily recognize the similarity between a sidechain and a small molecule that share a functional group. We introduce a new method, called AtomPaint, that avoids these limitations by employing a fully-atomic representation of protein structure. Starting from a model of a desired binding interaction, our method proceeds by (i) converting that model to a 3D image, (ii) masking out the parts of that image that need to be redesigned, (iii) using a diffusion model to inpaint the masked voxels, then (iv) using a classification model to identify the amino acids in the inpainted image. Both models are SE(3)-equivariant ResNets, and were trained on a dataset of structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) curated to emphasize protein/non-protein interactions. In a sequence recovery benchmark, AtomPaint performed better than random guessing, suggesting that it understands some aspects of molecular structure. We discuss possible avenues of improvement, in the hopes that the advantages of our novel image-based approach can be fully realized.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Structure-aware Graph Learning Predicts RNA Editability Across Tissues and Species</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rosenwsser, Z., Levitt, M., +1 author, Oren, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Programmable A-to-I RNA editing using endogenous ADAR enzymes is emerging as a therapeutic strategy, but editability remains difficult to predict because ADAR recognition depends on double-stranded RNA geometry and stability rather than sequence alone. We present ADAREDIT, a structure-explicit graph-attention framework that represents each dsRNA substrate as a nucleotide graph with backbone and base-pair edges and augments this representation with typed interactions and a motif-sensitive sequence branch. We trained and evaluated the model on high-confidence inverted Alu duplexes (n = 905) with secondary structures predicted by RNAfold and editing levels measured across 8,603 GTEx RNA-seq samples spanning 47 tissues. Across five tissue contexts and comprehensive cross-tissue transfer experiments, ADAREDIT consistently outperformed sequence-only CNN, transformer, and RNA language model baselines and achieved strong discrimination on combined tissue data (AUROC/AUPRC = 0.96; F1 {approx} 0.90). The same graph representation transferred to evolutionarily distant non-Alu species (sea urchin, acorn worm, and octopus), indicating conserved principles of ADAR substrate recognition. Finally, attention profiles and in silico mutagenesis recapitulated known biochemical constraints, including suppression by an upstream guanosine, and revealed longer-range asymmetric structural influences on editing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Topological Environment in Genetic and Metabolic Networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Castillo-Villalba, M. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The analysis of large gene and metabolic networks is often hindered by unknown biochemical parameters and the nonlinear nature of classical S-system models. To address this, we introduce a framework based on combinatorial toric geometry computed with tools such as Normaliz, SageMath, it is worth mentioning this technique in not restrictive to integer vectors, there exists a natural extension to real geometries. Unlike traditional approaches, which rely on parameter dependent fixed points, our method constructs a Topological Environment derived from the dual space of kinetic orders, leading to what we call orthogonal enzyme kinetics. Within this topological setting, fixed points are computed on the algebraic torus, enabling the transformation of nonlinear dynamics into linear forms. Importantly, these fixed points are independent of kinetic parameters and depend only on network topology and interaction signs. Applying this methodology to gene circuits involved in circadian rhythms, we reproduce previously reported oscillatory physiologies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EvoPool: Evolution-Guided Pooling of Protein Language Model Embeddings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">NaderiAlizadeh, N., Singh, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein language models (PLMs) encode amino acid sequences into residue-level embeddings that must be pooled into fixed-size representations for downstream protein-level prediction tasks. Although these embeddings implicitly reflect evolutionary constraints, existing pooling strategies operate on single sequences and do not explicitly leverage information from homologous sequences or multiple sequence alignments. We introduce EvoPool, a self-supervised pooling framework that integrates evolutionary information from homologs directly into aggregated PLM representations using optimal transport. Our method constructs a fixed-size evolutionary anchor from an arbitrary number of homologous sequences and uses sliced Wasserstein distances to derive query protein embeddings that are geometrically informed by homologous sequence embeddings. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art PLM families on the ProteinGym benchmark show that EvoPool consistently outperforms standard pooling baselines for variant effect prediction, demonstrating that explicit evolutionary guidance substantially enhances the functional utility of PLM representations. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/navid-naderi/EvoPool.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RareCapsNet: An explainable capsule networks enable robust discovery of rare cell populations from large-scale single-cell transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ray, S., Lall, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In-silico analysis of single cell data (downstream analysis) seeks considerable attention to the machine learning researchers in the last few years. Recent technological advances and increases in throughput capabilities open up great new chances to discover rare cell types. We develop RareCapsNet, a rare cell identification technique through capsule network in large single cell RNA-seq data. RareCapsNet aiming to leverage the landmark advantages of capsule networks in single cell domain, by identifying novel rare cell population through markers genes explained from human-mind-friendly interpretation of lower-level (primary) capsules. We demonstrate the explainability of capsule network for identifying novel markers that are act as signature of certain cell population of rare type. A comprehensive evaluation in simulated and real life single cell data demonstrate the efficacy of RareCapsNet for finding out rare population in large scRNA-seq data. RareCapsNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art not only in specificity and selectivity for identifying rare cell types, it can also successfully extract transcriptomic signature of the cell population. We demonstrate RareCapsNet to the dataset of multiple batch, where the model can store the knowledge of one batch which can be transferred to find out rare cells of other batch without training the model. Availability and Implementation: RareCapsNet is available at: https://github.com/sumantaray/RareCapsNet.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">petVAE: A Data-Driven Model for Identifying Amyloid PET Subgroups Across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tagmazian, A. A., Schwarz, C., +2 authors, Vuoksimaa, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) PET imaging is a core biomarker and is considered sufficient for the biological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is typically reduced to a binary A{beta}-/A{beta}+ classification. In this study, we aimed to identify subgroups along the continuum of A{beta} accumulation including subgroups within A{beta}- and A{beta}+. We used a total of 3,110 of A{beta} PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) datasets to develop petVAE, a 2D variational autoencoder model. The model accurately reconstructed A{beta} PET scans without prior labeling or pre-selection based on scanner type or region of interest. Latent representations of scans extracted from the petVAE (11,648 latent features per scan) were used to visualize, analyze, and cluster the AD continuum. We identified the latent features most representative of the continuum, and clustering of PET scans using these features produced four clusters. Post-hoc characterization revealed that two clusters (A{beta}-, A{beta}-+) were predominantly A{beta} negative and two (A{beta}+, A{beta}++) were predominantly A{beta} positive. All clusters differed significantly in standardized uptake value ratio (p &lt; 1.64e-8) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A{beta} (p &lt; 0.02), demonstrating petVAE's ability to assign scans along the A{beta} continuum. The clusters at the extremes of the continuum (A{beta}-, A{beta}++) resembled to the conventional A{beta} negative and A{beta} positive groups and differed significantly in cognitive performance, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) {epsilon}4 prevalence, and A{beta}, tau and phosphorylated tau CSF biomarkers (p &lt; 3e-6). The two intermediate clusters (A{beta}-+, A{beta}+) showed significantly higher odds of carrying at least one APOE {epsilon}4 allele compared with the A{beta}- cluster (p &lt; 0.026). Participants in A{beta}+ or A{beta}++ clusters exhibited a significantly faster rate of progression to AD compared to A{beta}- group (Hazard ratio = 2.42 and 9.43 for groups A{beta}+ and A{beta}++, respectively, p &lt; 1.17e-7). Thus, petVAE was capable of reconstructing PET scans while also extracting latent features that effectively represented the AD continuum and defined biologically meaningful clusters. By capturing subtle A{beta}-related changes in brain PET scans, petVAE-based classification enables the detection of preclinical AD stages and offers a new data-driven framework for studying disease progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Common Pitfalls in CircRNA Detection and Quantification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Weyrich, M., Trummer, N., +3 authors, List, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circular RNAs have garnered considerable interest, as they have been implicated in numerous biological processes and diseases. Through their stability, they are often considered promising biomarker candidates or therapeutic targets. Due to the lack of a poly(A) tail, circRNAs are best detected in total RNA-seq data after depleting ribosomal RNA. However, we observe that the application of circRNA detection in the vastly more ubiquitous poly(A)-enriched RNA-seq data still occurs. In this study, we systematically compare the detection of circRNAs in two matched poly(A) and ribosomal RNA-depleted data sets. Our results indicate that the comparably few circRNAs detected in poly(A) data are likely false positives. In addition, we demonstrate that the quality of sample processing, as measured by the fraction of ribosomal reads, significantly affects the sensitivity of circRNA detection, leading to a bias in downstream analysis. Our findings establish best practices for circRNA research: total RNA sequencing with effective rRNA depletion is the preferred approach for accurate circRNA profiling, whereas poly(A)-enriched data are unsuitable for comprehensive detection. Employing multiple circRNA detection tools and prioritizing back-splice junctions identified by several algorithms enhances confidence in the selection of candidates. These recommendations, validated across diverse datasets and tissue types, provide generalizable principles for robust circRNA analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Loss of PIK3CA allows in vitro growth but not in vivo progression of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Booth, A. L., Caso, G., +4 authors, Bien, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Constitutively active KRAS mutations are highly prevalent in lung cancers, but the direct role of its downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in tumor progression remains unclear. A previous study established the requirement for PIK3CA, the alpha catalytic isoform, in lung tumor development in mouse models with an intact Trp53 tumor suppressor. In this study, we further investigated the requirement for PIK3CA for tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. We first generated a "KPA" cell line by genetically deleting Pik3ca from a murine lung adenocarcinoma "KP" cell line harboring oncogenic Kras*G12D and lacking Trp53. We found that Pik3ca is not required for cell survival and growth in vitro, even under anchorage-independent conditions but reduced the growth rate by 20%. We next orthotopically implanted KP and KPA cells into syngeneic mice and found that PIK3CA is absolutely required for tumor progression, even in the absence of Trp53. Implantation of KP cells, or a "KPS" cell line lacking the Stk11 gene, led to rapid tumor growth and death of all host animals. In contrast, mice implanted with KPA cells all survived with no detectable lung tumors. The gene expression profiles from cultured cell lines suggest KPA cells may be vulnerable to oxidative stress. Indeed, we found KPA cells were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and diethyl maleate-induced oxidative stress as compared to KP and KPS cells. Together, these results demonstrate that PIK3CA is not required for lung cancer cell growth induced by mutant KRAS in vitro but is critically needed for in vivo progression and growth.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tissue Injury and Biomaterial Treatment Modulate Tumor Growth and Response to Immunotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ruta, A., Gray-Gaillard, E. F., +12 authors, Elisseeff, J. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immunotherapies have transformed cancer care; however, tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to high variability in therapeutic responses. While tissue injuries can impact cancer recurrence and metastatic spread, little is known about their potential to effect immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. In this study, we reveal that distal traumatic muscle injury accelerated progression and impaired adjuvant ICB response of multiple murine tumors. This injury-induced accelerated tumor growth coincided with decreased intra-tumoral density and effector phenotype of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells and relied on communication through a shared draining lymph node. Enhancing injury repair using a biological scaffold abrogated the injury-induced accelerated tumor growth in an interleukin-4-dependent manner and improved ICB response. In a retrospective cohort analysis of breast cancer patients undergoing ICB treatment, biological scaffold implantation following mastectomy was associated with increased overall survival. This work suggests that injury-driven immune dysfunction may contribute to cancer progression and ICB resistance, but enhancing wound healing with pro-regenerative biomaterials may offer a viable strategy for mitigating adverse cancer outcomes, particularly in the setting of adjuvant and neoadjuvant ICB.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly prevalent and aggressive type of brain tumor characterized by profound molecular complexity and poor prognosis. While conventional biomarker studies focus on highly significant genes or proteins associated with cancer outcomes, the contribution of gene-gene co-regulation to GBM progression remains unclear.</p>
