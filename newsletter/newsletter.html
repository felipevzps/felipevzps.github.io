<h2 class="paper-title">The Rayleigh Quotient and Principal Component Analysis I</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Carilli, M. T., Jackson, K. C., Pachter, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Contrastive learning methods can be powerful tools for genomics, enabling the identification of signals in an experiment via dimension reduction while reducing noise using a control. One such popular approach is contrastive PCA, which, despite being used in a variety of settings, does not scale to large datasets. We show that the contrastive PCA objective is an approximation of a Rayleigh quotient, analogous in form to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis and the common spatial patterns method. The Rayleigh quotient is {rho}PCA, satisfies numerous desirable properties, and provides an interpretable form of dimension reduction via generalized eigenvectors. We demonstrate that {rho}PCA is more accurate than contrastive PCA and much more efficient. We also show how it can be used not only for dimension reduction of data with respect to a control, but also for contrasting conditions via an analysis of single-nucleus transcriptomic data. Finally, we discuss probabilistic interpretations of {rho}PCA that provide further insight into its effective performance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">sc4D: spatio-temporal single-cell transcriptomics analysis through embedded optimal transport identifies joint glial response to Alzheimer's disease pathology</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rao, I., Kellis, M., Tanigawa, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A precise understanding of disease-associated spatio-temporal transcriptional dynamics is critical for nominating therapeutic interventions that drive desired perturbation responses. In disease contexts, pathological processes unfold across diverse cellular states, spatial environments, and timescales; however, current computational approaches have a limited ability to jointly model these complex dynamics or infer cellular trajectories from in silico perturbation experiments. Here, we present sc4D, a biologically interpretable spatio-temporal (4D) analysis framework for single-cell transcriptomics in disease studies, integrating autoencoder embeddings with optimal transport. Applying sc4D to longitudinal spatial transcriptomics samples from Alzheimer's disease mouse models, we report known disease biology and novel, testable mechanisms, including late-stage microglia-astrocyte syncytium near amyloid-beta plaques. In silico perturbations predict the restoration of protective, anti-inflammatory microglia through CAMTA1 activation or Donepezil, as validated by independent experimental findings. Overall, our work highlights the critical benefits of joint spatio-temporal modeling for elucidating disease mechanisms and predicting candidate interventions to improve cellular response.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SHEST: Single-cell-level artificial intelligence from haematoxylin and eosin morphology for cell type prediction and spatial transcriptomics reconstruction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jeong, H., Oh, J., +2 authors, Choi, Y.-L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A comprehensive understanding of cancer progression requires integrating tissue morphology with spatial molecular profiles. We present SHEST, a multi-task profiling framework that leverages haematoxylin and eosin morphology to predict cellular composition and reconstruct spatial gene expression at single-cell resolution. SHEST employs a quadruple-tile input capturing nuclear and contextual information, combined with a neighbourhood-informed clustering algorithm to filter ambiguous cellular signals. It comprises a shared morphological encoder with two task-specific heads: a classifier for cell type prediction and a reconstructor for gene expression. Multi-task optimisation uses cross-entropy and zero-inflated negative binomial losses, specifically addressing the sparsity of spatial transcriptomic data. Evaluation on human lung adenocarcinoma datasets demonstrated high accuracy for the principal reciprocal constituents of the tumour-immune axis (F1: 0.97 for tumour cells and 0.91 for lymphocytes). External validation confirmed its generalisability, revealing alveolar cells and their early neoplastic transitions. Reconstructed gene expression reproduced spatially resolved, cell-type-specific marker patterns--EPCAM in tumour cells, LTBP2 in fibroblasts, and CD3E in lymphocytes--recovering biologically coherent transcriptional architecture. SHEST also preserved distance-dependent spatial relationships and gene-level autocorrelation, reflecting the multicellular niche structure of the tumour microenvironment. By unifying cell type identification, gene expression reconstruction, and spatial mapping within a single interpretable framework, SHEST provides a synergistic and cost-efficient bridge between histopathology and spatial transcriptomics. This approach facilitates comprehensive tissue characterisation and forms a foundation for precision oncology through spatially informed, cell-level insights into tumour-immune ecosystems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PANCS-spec-Binders: A system for rapidly discovering isoform- or epitope-specific binders</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pixley, J. A., Styles, M. J., +5 authors, Dickinson, B. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins that bind to a target protein of interest, termed "binders," are essential components of biological research reagents and therapeutics. Target proteins present multiple binding surfaces with varying interaction potential. High-potential surfaces, or "hot spots," are experimentally identified as the most probable binding sites in de novo discovery campaigns. However, hot spots and their default binding modes do not always confer the desired specificity. Related proteins or isoforms often share similar hot spots, resulting in promiscuous binding. Interaction with a hot spot may also fail to elicit the intended biological outcome. Consequently, methods that direct de novo binder discovery toward targets with defined specificity are critically needed. We recently developed phage-assisted non-continuous selection of binders (PANCS-Binders), a selection platform with unparalleled speed and sequence-function fidelity that enables routine de novo binder discovery within days. However, because PANCS-Binder selections enrich variants based primarily on affinity, secondary screening is unlikely to identify binders to lesser hot spots because of the high likelihood of convergence. These alternative binding surfaces with weaker inherent interactions may possess desirable specificity profiles. Here, we develop PANCS-spec-Binders, which incorporates simultaneous selection and counterselection to control the specificity of enriched binders. We demonstrate PANCS-spec-Binders in two proof-of-concept applications: (1) discovery of isoform-selective binders that bind HRAS with &gt;100-fold higher affinity than the highly related KRAS isoform, and (2) discovery of epitope-specific binders that either target or avoid the LIR interaction region of LC3B. PANCS-spec-Binders enables rapid identification of binders with defined specificity within days.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pseudotimecascade visualizes gene expression cascade in pseudotime analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wan, C., Ji, B., Ji, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell transcriptomic technologies enable the reconstruction of dynamic biological processes such as cell development and differentiation. While existing pseudotime methods allow the analysis of temporal expression patterns, they primarily focus on individual genes, overlooking the coordinated programs that drive cellular transitions. We introduce Pseudotimecascade, a tool for visualizing and comparing multi-gene expression cascades along pseudotime. In addition, it links these cascades to biological functions by identifying stage-specific pathways. Applied to hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, Pseudotimecascade highlights regulatory hierarchies and stage-specific processes, offering a deeper understanding of gene programs that govern cell fate decisions. The Pseudotimecascade package is freely available at https://github.com/changxinw/Pseudotimecascade.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inference and validation of a dynamic gene regulatory network influencing cell fate during Duchenne muscular dystrophy initiation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guillot, E. G., Fort, Q. G., +11 authors, Dupont, J.-B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The onset of gene regulatory disturbances leading to developmental disorders remains poorly understood, particularly when symptoms begin after birth. Using induced pluripotent stem cells, single-cell transcriptomics and computational modeling, we determined the gene expression waves guiding early myogenesis and how they are affected by a disease-causing mutation. We uncovered a dynamic gene regulatory network organized in two kernels that function as a toggle-switch controlling stochastic cell fate decisions. In cells derived from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, these waves of regulation are less pronounced and the switch remains in the OFF state with a higher probability, resulting in convergence into a restricted cell fate. Experimental reactivation of the switch through RNA interference led to a rescued transcriptomic state and to a refined network topology. This work uncovers a dynamic regulatory mechanism underlying early cell fate divergence and provides a general framework to infer and validate dynamic gene regulatory networks involved in disease initiation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Graph Neural Networks Model Based on Atomic Hybridization for Predicting Drug Targets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mohamed, A. k., Galal, N., +1 author, Amin, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate prediction of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values is critical for accelerating drug discovery, yet traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models often have limited ability to capture both local structural patterns and global physicochemical properties essential for bioactivity. We developed a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with explicit molecular descriptors to address this limitation. The model learns from molecular graphs encoding atomic and bond features while incorporating interpretable physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints. Trained and validated on 14,316 compounds across nine diverse biological targets including kinases, nuclear receptors, and proteases, our approach achieved an overall test R2 of 0.87, consistently outperforming previously reported methods by 6-42% across evaluated targets. The model demonstrated robust generalization with near-identical training and test performance, while maintaining partial interpretability through transparent descriptor contributions and attention mechanisms. By synergistically combining data-driven learning with domain knowledge, this hybrid framework offers improved accuracy and interpretability for structure-activity modeling, facilitating more efficient compound prioritization and optimization in early-stage drug discovery programs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dataset Documentation for Responsible AI: Analysis of Suitability and Usage for Health Datasets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Heinke, A., Huang, L., +9 authors, Patel, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, but also raising concerns about algorithmic biases that mostly stem from the training data. It is widely supported that transparent dataset documentation is key to enabling responsible AI development. Several standardized dataset documentation approaches have been established, such as Datasheet, Dataset Nutrition Label, Accountability Documentation, Healthsheet, and Data Card. However, their suitability and usage for health datasets remain unclear. In this work, we compared all five approaches and evaluated their alignment with the STANDING Together Recommendations for Documentation of Health Datasets. We also investigated their real-world usage and gathered insights from generators and consumers of health datasets. Our findings reveal that none of these documentation approaches are used widely or fully suited for health datasets. We recommend developing a standard documentation approach for health datasets along with clear guidelines and automation tools to support adoption.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CBKMR: A Copula-based Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression Framework for Optimal Marker Detection in Omics Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chakraborty, A., Mattila, C., +2 authors, Seal, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-throughput bulk and single-cell omics technologies enable comprehensive molecular profiling, yet identifying compact, biologically interpretable marker sets that distinguish cell types, conditions, or disease states remains challenging. Standard pipelines rely on univariate differential expression tests, which ignore gene--gene dependencies and nonlinear effects, while multivariate machine-learning (ML) methods often lack principled feature selection} and {uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) framework offers an appealing alternative because it (a) captures nonlinear gene--outcome relationships and higher-order interactions, and (b) enables {automatic relevance determination (ARD)} through sparsity-inducing priors. However, we show that the traditional latent Gaussian process (GP) formulation of BKMR is inadequate for discrete outcomes (e.g., cell-type labels), leading to biased inference and unstable variable selection. We propose a copula-based Bayesian kernel machine regression (CBKMR) model that uses outcome-appropriate discrete marginals while a Gaussian copula captures kernel-induced dependence across observations. To ensure scalability to modern single-cell datasets, we further introduce a nearest-neighbor GP-based variant, NNCBKMR, which reduces computational complexity from O(N3) to nearly linear in N. Simulation studies show that CBKMR more accurately captures nonlinear effects and yields stronger marker-selection performance than BKMR and top ensemble ML methods (e.g., random forests, XGBoost). Applications to multiple scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that CBKMR identifies concise marker panels that align closely with expert-annotated gene signatures while providing{posterior uncertainty} for principled decision-making.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evo2HiC: a multimodal foundation model for integrative analysis of genome sequence and architecture</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fang, T., Wang, X., +7 authors, Wang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how genomic sequences shape three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture is fundamental to interpreting diverse biological processes. Although previous studies have shown that sequence information can predict 3D genome architecture, they fall short in capturing cell type-specific structures because they are trained solely on sequence inputs. The widely available Hi-C data, which contain rich structural information across biosamples, can provide complementary features to sequence data for studying cell type-specific architectures. Recently, DNA foundation models have demonstrated encouraging performance in capturing long-range genomic dependencies, holding promise for modeling chromatin interactions. However, the extremely high computational cost of running these models limits their applicability to Hi-C analysis, which requires genome-wide sequence embeddings. Here, we present Evo2HiC, a multimodal foundation model that jointly models genomic sequences and structures to study cell type-specific chromatin structure. The key idea of Evo2HiC is to distill a large-scale DNA foundation model, Evo~2 (7B), into a compact encoder, while guiding the distillation with Hi-C data to preserve genomic features critical for 3D genome analysis. The model supports two types of encoders, one that operates directly on DNA sequences, and a second that additionally takes as input corresponding Hi-C data. Using the DNA-only encoder and predicting Hi-C contact matrices, Evo2HiC improved Spearman correlation by 10.9% over Orca. Moreover, by jointly embedding Hi-C and sequence information Evo2HiC achieved the best overall Pearson correlation when predicting five representative epigenomic assays. Interpretation analysis of Evo2HiC revealed its ability to identify cell type-specific sequence motifs that explain changes in epigenomic signals. Finally, we demonstrated the cross-species generalizability of Evo2HiC on 177 species from the DNA Zoo dataset for Hi-C resolution enhancement. In summary, Evo2HiC is a foundation model that integrates genome sequences and 3D chromatin structure information, substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy on predicting various epigenomic signals and genome architecture, enables the identification of cell type-specific motifs, and demonstrates robust generalizability across species.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EGFR suppression and drug-induced potentiation are widespread features of oncogenic RTK fusions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gao, Y., Gonzalez Martinez, D., +5 authors, Bugaj, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Regulation of cancer cells by their environment contributes to tumorigenesis and drug response, though the extent to which the oncogenic state can alter a cell's perception of its environment is not clear. Prior studies found that EML4-ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusion oncoprotein, suppresses transmembrane receptor signaling through EGFR. Moreover, suppression was reversed with targeted ALK inhibition, thereby promoting survival and drug tolerance. Here we tested whether such modulation of EGFR was common among other RTK fusions, which collectively are found in ~5% of all cancers. Using live- and fixed-cell microscopy in isogenic and patient-derived cell lines, we found that a wide variety of RTK fusions suppress transmembrane EGFR and sequester essential adaptor proteins in the cytoplasm, as evidenced by the localization of endogenous Grb2. Targeted therapies rapidly released Grb2 from sequestration and potentiated EGFR. Synthetic optogenetic analogs of RTK fusions confirmed that cytoplasmic sequestration of Grb2 was sufficient to suppress perception of extracellular EGF and could do so without driving signaling from the synthetic fusion itself, demonstrating that fusion signaling and suppression of EGFR could be functionally decoupled. Our study uncovers that a large number of RTK fusions simultaneously act as both activators and suppressors of signaling, the mechanisms of which could be exploited for new biomimetic therapies that enhance cell killing and suppress drug tolerance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Characterization of lymphoma models for the surface ROR1 expression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tarantelli, C., Civanelli, E., +4 authors, Bertoni, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a developmental antigen aberrantly expressed in several B-cell malignancies and represents an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we systematically characterized ROR1 expression in a large panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines and assessed the activity of a ROR1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ROR1 RNA expression was first evaluated using a previously generated total RNA-Seq dataset from 47 B-cell lymphoma cell lines. ROR1 transcripts were detectable in most models, with 19 cell lines showing moderate to high expression. To determine whether ROR1 is present on the cell surface, we next analyzed 29 cell lines by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated anti-ROR1 antibody. Only a subset of cell lines expressed appreciable levels of ROR1 on the cell membrane, with the highest expression observed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) models compared with other B-cell lymphoma subtypes, and detectable expression in a few diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and one marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) line. ROR1 RNA and surface protein levels were highly correlated. As a proof of principle, four ROR1-positive DLBCL cell lines and one cell line with low surface protein were exposed to the ROR1-targeting ADC zilovertamab vedotin for 120 hours. All ROR1-positive models were sensitive, with IC50 values ranging from 28 to 58 nM, whereas the remaining one was largely resistant. In summary, we defined a set of well-characterized lymphoma models suitable for preclinical studies of ROR1-directed agents, confirming the functional relevance of ROR1 surface expression for the activity of zilovertamab vedotin.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Small Non-coding RNA miR-16-1-3p Hampers Cancer Stem Cell Self-renewal and Invasiveness, Boosting Chemosensitivity by Adjusting TGF-β1 Signaling via MDM2/p53 Axis in Human Osteosarcoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">XUE, W., WANG, Y., +5 authors, Leonov, S. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The TGF-{beta} signaling pathway has both tumor-suppressing and metastasis-promoting effects in cancer. However, the molecular determinants governing this switch remain unclear. Here, we explored the miR-16-1-3p/MDM2/p53 axis as a critical conductor of the TGF-{beta}-Smad pathway in osteosarcoma. Although miR-16-1-3p overexpression by itself markedly reduces proliferative and clonogenic potential of U2OS cells, when paired with TGF-{beta} treatment, it significantly increase arrest cells in G1 phase and nearly extinguishing the growth capability of these cells. MiR-16-1-3p overexpression inhibited TGF-induced actin remodeling and EMT featuring, significantly decreasing vimentin levels. TGF-{beta} enhances both 2D and 3D migration, but miR-16-1-3p overexpression, alone or with TGF-{beta}, strongly counteracts its pro-migratory effects. MiR-16-1-3p restored p53 stability by targeting MDM2, redirecting TGF-{beta}-Smad signaling toward p21 activation and proliferation inhibition while attenuating its EMT-promoting capacity. Administration of TGF-{beta} together with miR-16-1-3p dramatically increases the sensitivity of wild-type U2OS cells to cisplatin, exceeding that of TGF-{beta} therapy alone by more than an order of magnitude. Administering TGF-{beta} and miR-16-1-3p together significantly reduces the tumor nodule volume and Ki67 expression, while effectively eradicates metastases in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo model. Analysis of the TARGET-OS cohort revealed that high TGFB1 and low MDM2 expression correlated with improved survival. For the first time, our research demonstrates that miR-16-1-3p shifts TGF-{beta}1 signaling from a facilitator of metastasis to a promoter of anti-growth effects through MDM2 inhibition and p53 stabilization, effectively reducing the self-renewal and invasiveness of cancer stem cells in human osteosarcoma model. This process preserves TGF-{beta}'s tumor-suppressive role while limiting its associated cancer risks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Lymphotoxin-driven cancer cell eradication by tumoricidal CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xie, H., Jiang, A., +36 authors, Jenkins, R. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy is FDA-approved for patients with treatment-resistant advanced melanoma, but the TIL subpopulations critical for tumor eradication remains incompletely understood. Using patient-derived TIL-melanoma co-cultures, we identified and characterized a novel subset of CD8+ TIL, capable of class I HLA-independent cancer cell lysis. The lymphotoxin {beta} receptor (LT{beta}R) and interferon (IFN) sensing pathways were nominated as key determinants of TIL-mediated cancer cell killing from a whole-genome, loss-of-function CRISPR screen. Validation studies confirmed that dual LT{beta}R and IFN sensing is necessary and sufficient for cancer cell lysis, and that expanded CD8+ TIL express high lymphotoxin {beta} (LTB) and upregulate lymphotoxin (LTA) upon coculture with cancer cells. Leveraging paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data, we confirmed that enrichment of LTB+CD8+ T cells is associated with clinical response to TIL, and that LTB+CD8+ TIL are expanded from putative neoantigen-reactive, LTBlo CD8+ T cells in resected tumors. We have uncovered a previously unrecognized mechanism of TIL-mediated tumor eradication, providing mechanistic insights into the role of LTBR/IFN signaling in TIL-mediated cancer cell killing, and potentially offering insights into novel strategies to isolate, enrich, and expand tumoricidal TIL or augment specific TIL functions to enhance tumor control.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Construction and validation of a risk prediction model for complications in patients with acute leukemia based on machine learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rong Xu, Hong Tian, +1 author, Shulan Gu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Early-phase severe complications remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality during induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. Existing risk scores capture only limited prognostic variance and are rarely well-calibrated for clinical decision support. To develop and externally validate a machine-learning model that accurately predicts severe complications after induction, and to assess its clinical utility across key patient sub-groups. We retrospectively assembled electronic-health-record data from three tertiary haematology centres (2013-2024). After exclusion of duplicates and predefined ineligible cases, 2 870 adults with newly diagnosed AML or ALL were analysed (derivation = 2 009; external validation = 861). Forty-two candidate predictors spanning demographics, comorbidity indices, baseline laboratory values, disease biology and treatment logistics were selected via multiple imputation, Winsorised z-scaling and correlation filtering. Five supervised algorithms-including Elastic-Net, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and a multilayer perceptron-were trained using nested 5-fold cross-validation. Discrimination, calibration, decision-curve net benefit and SHAP-based interpretability were evaluated according to TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI recommendations. LightGBM achieved the highest mean AUROC in derivation (0.824 ± 0.008) and maintained robust performance in external validation (AUROC = 0.801, 95% CI 0.774-0.827; AUPRC = 0.628). Calibration was excellent (slope = 0.97; intercept = - 0.03; Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.41). Decision-curve analysis showed superior net benefit over "treat-all," "treat-none," and a four-variable logistic benchmark across risk thresholds of 5-40%, potentially enabling targeted interventions for 14 additional high-risk patients per 100 at a 20% threshold, though clinical benefit requires prospective validation. Discrimination remained ≥ 0.80 in AML, older adults and all three centres. CRP, absolute neutrophil count, cytogenetic-risk tier, age and ferritin were the top predictors, with interpretable monotonic SHAP effects. A rigorously validated LightGBM model provides well-calibrated, interpretable prediction of early severe complications after induction therapy for acute leukaemia and provides a foundation for risk-adapted supportive care strategies, though prospective studies are needed to demonstrate clinical impact. Prospective implementation studies are warranted to confirm real-world impact.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Patent analysis of mRNA therapy using deep learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yuanqi Cai, Xuejing Zhang, +7 authors, Kunmeng Liu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mRNA vaccines have demonstrated great potential. In 2023, mRNA won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Currently, the global research and development of mRNA technology is accelerating. It is urgently necessary to use patent analysis to clarify the technological competitive landscape, providing a basis for technological innovation and industrial development in this field. This study is based on the Derwent patent database and employs social network analysis and patent quality assessment methods to conduct a quantitative analysis of mRNA therapeutic patents over the past 27 years. Deep learning and machine learning methods are used to predict future core technologies and patentees. The study found that mRNA drugs are currently primarily used in the fields of infectious diseases and cancer. Delivery technology remains one of the critical challenges, while targeted drug research and vector technology will be one of the key future directions for the field. Meanwhile, New organizations have developed novel delivery technologies to break through the patent thickets established by giant companies. The global landscape of mRNA therapy is undergoing a multifaceted developmental pattern, and the monopoly of giant companies is being challenged. The patent landscape of mRNA therapies constructed based on deep learning methods in this study can not only serve as a knowledge tool for comprehensive integration and use, but also inspire the development of efficient production methods for mRNA therapies.</p>
