<h2 class="paper-title">Low-temperature HILIC provides enhanced separations and stability for LC-MS-based metabolomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Y., Jastrab, M. L., +5 authors, Skinner, O. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is a potent and robust tool for studying metabolism. However, conventional workflows can suffer from poor peak shapes, limited pressure tolerance, co-elution of polar metabolites, and unstable retention times. Here, we describe the development of a more stable HILIC method for LC-MS metabolomics of human plasma and cell extracts, optimizing a zwitterionic HILIC (Z-HILIC) column for improved untargeted performance. We found that using high-pH ammonium bicarbonate with 90% acetonitrile in mobile phase B (ABC B) can greatly improve peak shapes of select metabolites when compared to 100% acetonitrile (ACN B), but at the cost of poor retention time stability. We therefore focused on optimizing chromatography for the ACN B method and observed that cooling the column to 5 C substantially enhanced peak shape. This low-temperature Z-HILIC (LT-ZHILIC) method provides high-resolution separation of metabolites from both cellular extracts and human plasma, is stable over days, and generally outperformed a standard method using the widely described ZIC-pHILIC column. Application of the untargeted LT-ZHILIC method to characterize the metabolic consequences of glutamine and pyruvate deficiency in human cells revealed a striking change in nucleotide phosphates; a perturbation that was not observed in the ZIC-pHILIC analysis of the same samples likely due to inadequate elution profiles. In sum, the LT-ZHILIC workflow offers a robust platform to advance untargeted metabolomics by improving metabolite coverage, resolution, and retention time stability, making it a promising technique for providing novel insights into cellular metabolic rewiring and the human plasma metabolome.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">De novo designed bifunctional proteins for targeted protein degradation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mylemans, B., Korona, B., +6 authors, Woolfson, D. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is a therapeutic strategy to remove disease-causing proteins by routing them to the ubiquitin-proteasome, autophagy, or lysosme machineries. For instance, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are synthetic hetero-bifunctional small molecules that simultaneously bind the target and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to drive ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Despite considerable success, designing such molecules is challenging and the number of currently addressable ubiquitin E3 ligases is limited. Here we demonstrate hetero-bifunctional de novo designed proteins as alternatives for TPD to access more targets and ligases. First, we develop a stable and highly adaptable helix-turn-helix scaffold for presenting different binding sites. Next, we use computational protein design to incorporate and embellish hot-spot- binding sites to target BCL-xL, plus short linear motifs (SLiMs) for KLHL20 ligase recruitment. The resulting mono- and bi-functionalised proteins bind the targets in vitro, and the latter degrade BCL-xL in cells leading to apoptosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evaluation of a structure-based method for ab initio gene detection using deep learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hummel, J., Estrada, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, a novel method for the detection of exons within genomic DNA sequences was implemented and evaluated. This is a structure-based approach, inspired by recent work from Sharma et al., by which nucleotide sequences are converted into physicochemical profiles based on trinucleotide and tetranucleotide mappings that were estimated via molecular dynamics simulations [8,12]. Three deep learning models with architectures suitable for multidimensional sequence classification were trained on the structural profiles for sequences at the junctions between exons and introns, as well as those sampled from other regions of a human reference genome. The trained models showed promising performance in the evaluation set, but will require a much more sophisticated and robust post-processing approach to achieve compelling exon- or gene-level classification performance in realistic use cases. A tool by Sharma et al. based on the same structural approach, which they named ChemEXIN [12], was also evaluated. The results indicate that the approach taken in this work during the development and application of the models offers a major improvement over ChemEXIN, and may more accurately reflect the potential of the underlying idea.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SPOmiAlign: A modality-agnostic framework for robust and scalable spatial multimodal alignment via feature matching</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, Y., He, Z., Yan, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multimodal spatial omics enables systematic characterization of tissue organization by jointly profiling molecular features across transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic layers. However, integrative analysis across sections and modalities is frequently hindered by non-linear tissue distortions, mismatched spatial resolutions, and the absence of shared molecular features. To address these challenges, we introduce SPOmiAlign, a modality-agnostic framework based on uncertainty-aware dense feature matching for spatial multimodal alignment. The framework achieves second-level runtime efficiency and enables accurate alignment across heterogeneous spatial omics datasets, as well as between spatial omics and histology, without manual effort or modality-specific tuning. Across diverse datasets, SPOmiAlign consistently achieves higher alignment accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate its utility through automated registration of spatial omics data to a common coordinate framework (CCF), enabling anatomical annotation. Applying SPOmiAlign to spatial multi-omic data demonstrates how accurate multimodal alignment is essential for integrative spatial multi-omic analysis, enabling the identification of coherent spatial domains across modalities and supporting a broad range of downstream spatial analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Understanding the LLM-based gene embeddings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cai, Y., Gan, D., +1 author, Li, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large language model (LLM)-derived gene embeddings, generated from brief NCBI gene descriptions, have shown strong performance in recent biological applications, yet the biological information they contain remains unclear. We evaluate these embeddings using a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)-based framework that treats each embedding dimension as a potential carrier of pathway-level information. OpenAI's embeddings recover over 93% of Hallmark and C2 pathways, with pathway signals distributed across many dimensions. Even embeddings generated from gene symbols alone recover more than 64% of pathways, indicating substantial prior biological knowledge embedded in the model. Comparing 11 small language models reveals that domain-specific models perform best with minimal input, but all models approach OpenAI-level coverage when given modest textual context. Collectively, these results show that LLM-derived embeddings encode unexpectedly extensive pathway-level information, supporting their use as lightweight, informative representations for downstream biological analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic Yarrowia lipolytica consortium for efficient conversion of lignocellulosic oligosaccharides into lipids</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Crespo-Roche, D., Gonzalez-Garcia, D., +3 authors, Barriuso, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is an abundant and renewable feedstock for the sustainable production of bioproducts; however, its industrial exploitation is limited by its complex composition and by the lack of microbial platforms capable of simultaneously degrading and assimilating cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived oligosaccharides. Yarrowia lipolytica lacks the native enzymatic machinery required for this process. In this study, we engineered a multifunctional strain (YBXT-XR-BGL3) able to secrete fungal b-glucosidase (BGL3 or BGL1) and b-xylosidase (BxTw1) from Talaromyces amestolkiae, enabling the hydrolysis of cellobiose and xylooligosaccharides, respectively. In addition, a xylose reductase pathway was introduced to confer xylose assimilation. Because the construction of a single multifunctional strain may impose a significant metabolic burden and reduce fitness, we benchmarked this strain against a division-of-labor strategy. To this end, we also developed a cellobiose-specialized strain (YBGL3 or YBGL1) and a xylooligosaccharide-specialized strain (YBXT-XR). Functional characterization revealed efficient saccharification of cello- and xylooligosaccharides under acidic conditions, with BGL3 outperforming BGL1 in glucose release and BxTw1 exhibiting broad pH tolerance. Under nitrogen-limited conditions, this enabled lipid accumulation of up to 20% from cellobiose in YBGL3 and YBXT-XR-BGL3, and up to 15% from xylooligosaccharides in YBXT and YBXT-XR-BGL3. In co-culture experiments using a mixed substrate (glucose, cellobiose, and xylooligosaccharides), both the multifunctional strain and the consortium produced up to 0.67 g L-1 of lipids. However, the division-of-labor approach led to higher lipid accumulation (34% versus 26.3% in the monoculture), driven by a rapid population shift: following cellobiose depletion (after 72 h), YBXT-XR became predominant and utilized the remaining xylooligosaccharides almost exclusively for lipid synthesis. Overall, this study provides the first demonstration of a Y. lipolytica system capable of simultaneously utilizing cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived oligosaccharides. Moreover, benchmarking a division-of-labor consortium against a multifunctional monoculture highlights a robust strategy to enhance lipid biosynthesis and improve process resilience for LCB valorization.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Assessing Knowledge Distillation of a Multi-Emitter Localizing Neural Network for Applications in Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Reed, M. B., Zadegan, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Super Resolution Microscopy (SRM) is a powerful method in quantitative bioscience that allows interrogation of nanoscale details. These methods require extensive imaging times on the microscope resulting in data sets on the scale of gigabytes. In order to reduce imaging times, the concentration of emitters can be increased, however that results in overlapping emitters rendering the isolation of single emitters extremely difficult. Statistical methods have been developed to deconvolute overlapping emitters, however they require parameter optimization and user expertise. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has been developed to automate this analysis but often require larger Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While powerful, such models require compute and storage that would make pushing these models to compute limited devices difficult. To address this, we investigate if the dense multi-emitter localization capacity of a larger model, Deep Residual Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (DRL-STORM), can be transferred to a smaller model, Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ITRAP2, a flexible and robust strategy to assign antigen recognition of T-cells in a coupled single-cell TCR-pMHC assay</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nos, G. A., Bentzen, A. K., +8 authors, Hadrup, S. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Determining T-cell specificity forms a crucial step toward understanding T-cell involvement in health and disease. Single-cell sequencing technologies allow for co-capture of TCR alpha and beta chains, and their antigen specificity can be determined through peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimer binding and capture of a co-attached barcode oligo. However, SC sequencing often includes a high level of dropouts and risk of cross-contamination. Similarly, barcoded pMHC readouts often suffer from significant background noise. These issues complicate the automatic assignment of pMHC recognition to TCR clonotypes. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method for data denoising - Improved T-cell Receptor Antigen Paring 2 (ITRAP2). This approach significantly reduces noise in single-cell pMHC readouts and allows for accurate identification of TCR specificity. ITRAP2 incorporates statistical tests and confidence metrics for each TCR-pMHC pairing, offering user flexibility in pairing rigor, and allows multiple pMHC assignments to the same T-cell clone in the event of cross-binding within the pMHC multimer library. We tested this method on an in-house generated dataset of 8141 single cells, screened for CD8 T-cell binding using a panel of 100 different barcode-labelled pMHC multimers holding virus-derived peptides, and on a larger public dataset from 10x Genomics with 208,589 T-cells evaluated for recognition using a panel of 50 different pMHCs. In both datasets, ITRAP2 was able to recover TCR-pMHC hits that were missed either when investigating the raw data or analyzing the data using alternative tools. Importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the pMHC multimer library is crucial for accurate pMHC-TCR pairing and that a minimum of 25 pMHC multimer should be included to optimally determine background characteristic, and assigning true positive events.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Regulatable In Vivo Gene Expression via Adaptamers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bryant, J., Herron, L., +6 authors, Mali, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise, reversible control of transgene expression is essential for safe and durable gene therapy, yet current inducible systems remain difficult to translate in vivo due to large size, limited induction duration, and dependence on immunogenic regulators. Here we present the adaptamer (ADAR modulatable aptamer), a compact (&lt;120 bp) RNA switch that couples an FDA approved small molecule responsive aptamer with endogenous ADAR mediated RNA editing to regulate expression. Ligand binding stabilizes a double stranded RNA structure that recruits ADAR to convert a stop codon into a sense codon, restoring downstream protein translation. This cleavage free, post transcriptional mechanism enables precise, small molecule dependent modulation without exogenous protein machinery. We demonstrate that adaptamers are highly functional across multiple cell lines, including human T cells. In mice, AAV delivered adaptamer controlled FGF21 expression induced metabolic remodeling, significantly increasing energy expenditure and reversing obesity. This minimal, programmable system offers a clinically compatible approach for tunable genetic medicines and safe deployment of pleiotropic and dose limited proteins.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploiting pair correlation function to describe biological tissue structure</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mangane, F., Casanova, R., +7 authors, Bost, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multiplexed imaging technologies now enable the simultaneous profiling of hundreds to thousands of molecular targets in intact tissues, providing unprecedented insight into cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. While data generation has rapidly matured, the quantitative analysis of spatial structure remains challenging and poorly standardized, particularly across biological length scales. Existing approaches, such as distance-based metrics, neighborhood analyses and graph neural networks, either capture only local interactions or sacrifice interpretability for predictive power. Here we introduce PCF SiM (Pair Correlation Function Sigmoid Modeling), a scalable and interpretable framework that leverages parametric modeling of the pair correlation function to quantify spatial organization in multiplexed imaging data. PCF SiM compresses complex spatial patterns into a small set of biologically meaningful parameters, enabling robust comparisons across cell types, samples and conditions. Applying PCF SiM to diverse public spatial transcriptomics datasets, we demonstrate its ability to detect condition dependent tissue remodeling in a mouse colitis model. We further extend the framework with a coscaling strategy that identifies cell types participating in shared spatial structures. Using newly generated clinical datasets from Hashimoto thyroiditis and uveal melanoma liver metastases, PCF SiM reveals hierarchical organization of autoimmune infiltrates and coordinated spatial interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Finally, we show that reliable inference of tissue scale architecture requires whole slide imaging, exposing intrinsic limitations of tumor microarray based spatial analyses. Together, PCF SiM provides a principled and interpretable approach for spatial analysis of multiplexed imaging data.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While most meningiomas are benign and can be surgically removed, a subset behaves aggressively, recurs quickly, and can ultimately be fatal. Recent work has focused on defining this aggressive group. To better characterize this clinically distinct, high-risk group, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from human meningiomas using a dimension-reduced reference landscape. We identified an NF2 mutant subtype enriched for chromosome 10q loss and low PTEN expression, both of which were strongly associated with shorter time to recurrence. To directly test causality, we engineered several genetically accurate, immunocompetent in vitro and in vivo mouse models with Pten knockdown or knockout. Across models, Pten loss markedly accelerated YAP1-driven tumorigenesis. Projection of Pten-deficient mouse tumors onto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from human meningiomas revealed that mouse tumors faithfully recapitulate the transcriptional programs of aggressive NF2 mutant meningiomas and robustly predicted clinical outcomes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PTEN loss cooperates with YAP1 activation to drive aggressive NF2 mutant meningioma biology, and that the high fidelity of this model to human disease establishes it as a robust platform for mechanistic investigation and therapeutic testing. More broadly, this work highlights the power of cross-species integration in both validating preclinical models and enhancing the translational relevance and utility of dimension-reduced reference landscapes across diverse disease types.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Srivastava, S., Powers, J. J., +22 authors, Amelio, A. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract Accessibility of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) in many solid tumors can be influenced by extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, organization, and remodeling within tumor stroma. Specifically, lysyl hydroxylase-2 (LH2)-catalyzed lysine hydroxylation in type-I collagen telopeptides leads to formation of intermolecular collagen cross-links creating a stiffened and proteolytically resistant, stable ECM. Advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) frequently exhibit desmoplasia with elevated LH2 expression, and Immune-checkpoint (ICI) therapy is effective in only &lt;20% patients, suggesting that ECM remodeling mechanistically governs the composition and function of TME infiltrates. We show that elevated LH2 and collagen alignment promotes stromal accumulation of CD8+ T cells, and poor response to ICI in HPV- HNSCCs. Integration of clinical biopsies, transcriptomic datasets, and an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model revealed that aligned collagen spatially restricts adhesion G protein-coupled receptor positive (ADGRG1+) CD8+ T cells to activate a non-canonical GPCR-mediated mechanosensory program that drives dysfunction and exhaustion.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Refined cellular activity expression signatures provide a targeted framework to quantify phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity in single-cell data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Martinez, P., Coutant, A., +11 authors, Vigneron, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) now allows deeper insight into cellular biology at both the individual and population level. Measuring cell-to-cell variations in the population enables quantification of phenotypic heterogeneity in populations in which cell states and identities deviate from healthy transcriptomic profiles. Cellular activities quantifiable using gene set enrichment analyses can provide useful grounds to quantify phenotypic heterogeneity, but the specificity and adequacy of existing molecular signatures for scRNA-seq data is still insufficient. Here we induced 6 activities in vitro, for which we refined existing expression signatures to enhance specificity and detection in scRNA-seq data: epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), DNA repair, responses to interferons and {gamma} (IFN and IFN{gamma}, respectively), glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We report new signatures, with much lower redundancy between IFN and IFN{gamma}, and glycolysis and OxPhos signatures, achieving average AUCs of 0.85 across bootstrapped datasets for each activity. We could use these signatures to quantify phenotypic intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) in 20 patient samples and 14 cell lines, observing high correlation with diversity indices in classified healthy cells (p&lt;0.001). Focusing on cancer cells only, we furthermore report higher phenotypic ITH in patients than in cell lines (p&lt;0.001), and in basal tumors (p=0.028).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Nicotinamide Salvage Pathway is a Metabolic Vulnerability of High-Risk MDS Stem Cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Patel, S. B., Moskop, D., +26 authors, Pietras, E. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) is a malignant clonal disorder originating in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The current standard of care for HR-MDS patients is hypomethylating agents; however, the response rate is poor. There is thus a need to explore vulnerabilities of HR-MDS HSPCs for better clinical outcomes. We demonstrate that HR-MDS HSPCs have significant upregulation of metabolic proteins required for glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Consistently, we see increased oxygen consumption rate in HR-MDS HSPCs compared to healthy, suggesting an increased metabolic rate. Corroboratively, compared to healthy HSPCs, HR-MDS HSPCs have increased abundance of mitochondrial complex I proteins, which are NADH dehydrogenases, and crucial for energy production. Therefore, we investigated whether HR-MDS HSPCs are functionally reliant on NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the nicotinamide salvage pathway of NAD anabolism. NAMPT inhibition significantly decreased NAD(H) in HR-MDS HSPCs. Consequently, NAMPT inhibition reduced the oxygen-consuming capacity of HR-MDS-HSPCs compared to healthy. Importantly, NAMPT inhibition significantly impaired the self-renewal and colony-forming potential, increased cell death and reduced disease burden specifically of HR-MDS HSPCs, compared to healthy controls. Collectively, our data suggest that NAMPT is selectively required for the function and survival of HR-MDS HSPCs representing a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hallmarks of adaptive immunity in a metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) long-term elite survivor</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tucci, F., Drydale, E., +18 authors, Bashford-Rogers, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) presents with metastatic disease in nearly one-third of patients, with a 5-year survival of only ~10%. Although anti-angiogenic therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved outcomes, therapeutic resistance and immune-related adverse events limit durable responses. Exceptional long-term survivors provide a unique opportunity to uncover mechanisms of sustained anti-tumour immunity and guide therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a spatial and temporal dissection of adaptive immunity in an extraordinary 16-year ccRCC survivor, integrating single-cell sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, B and T cell receptor (BCR/TCR) repertoire analysis, and antibody profiling. We reveal persistent and spatially coordinated B and T cell clones over 16 years, indicating long-term immune memory and surveillance throughout tumour evolution. B cell analysis identified pronounced clonal expansions involving intrinsically autoreactive IGHV4-34 B cells undergoing ongoing germinal centre (GC) maturation in tumour-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spleen. These clones progressively lost autoreactivity while acquiring tumour-specificity through somatic hypermutation (SHM), consistent with clonal redemption. Redeemed B cells displayed enhanced antigen-presenting functions and localised to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), where they interacted with CD8+ T cells, as inferred from doublet analysis. In parallel, persistent CD8+ effector T cell clones highlighted the contribution of long-lived lymphocytes to tumour control. Comparison of the primary tumour and pancreatic metastatic with paired tumour-free dLNs showed that TLS mirrored GC functionality, particularly for PD-1+ CD8+ T cells, while TLS maturation was stroma-dependent and impaired at the metastatic site. Finally, tumour-derived BCRs revealed antibody binding to tumour specific public antigens without cross-reactivity to normal tissue. Together, these findings establish clonal persistence, TLS engagement, and coordinated B-T cell immune surveillance as hallmarks of durable tumour control, providing a framework for next-generation antibody therapeutics and patient stratification in metastatic ccRCC.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Le Zhou, Zhongjiang Lan, +4 authors, Ruinian Zheng</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) represents a significant proportion of lung cancer cases, with immunotherapy serving as a cornerstone of treatment. Although immunotherapy has advanced significantly, the prognosis for patients in advanced stages remains suboptimal. Lactylation, a newly discovered metabolic pathway, has been recognized as a critical mechanism driving the initiation and development of many cancers, including LUAD. Using machine learning, this research aims to pinpoint lactylation-related lncRNAs (LRLs) that could serve as prognostic markers in LUAD, shedding light on tumor development and novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Enguang Fu, Zane R Thornburg, +5 authors, Zaida Luthey-Schulten</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Macromolecular complexes in the genetically minimized bacterium, JCVI-syn3A, support gene expression (RNA polymerase, ribosome, degradosome), metabolism (ABC transporters, ATP synthase), and chromosome dynamics. In this work, we further incorporate the assembly of 21 unique macromolecular complexes into the existing whole-cell kinetic model of Syn3A. The synthesis and translocation of protein subunits in membrane complexes occur through distinct pathways. A range of 2D association rates for membrane complexes were considered to guarantee a high yield of assembly, given the existing time scales of gene expression. By alleviation of the undesired kinetically trapped intermediates in ATP synthase assembly, the efficiency was improved. The assembly of RNA polymerase, ribosome, and degradosome influences the speed and efficiency of protein synthesis. Collectively, this model predicted time-dependent cellular behaviors consistent with experiments. A machine learning analysis of the time-dependent metabolomics and metabolic fluxes highlighted the effect of introducing a complex assembly into our whole-cell model.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProSECFPs: A Novel Fingerprint-Based Protein Representation Method for Missense Mutation Pathogenicity Prediction.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Clarissa Poles, Miriana Di Stefano, +5 authors, Antonio Giordano</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Developing effective computational representations of protein sequences is crucial for advancing diverse areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Ideal representations must be computationally efficient, scalable, informative, flexible across contexts, and broadly applicable. To address these requirements, we propose Protein Sequence Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ProSECFPs), a novel fingerprinting method inspired by Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), commonly used in chemoinformatics to represent small molecules. ProSECFPs effectively capture the complex physicochemical characteristics, sequence-specific details, and structural attributes intrinsic to protein sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of ProSECFPs by evaluating their performance in predicting the pathogenicity of missense mutations by applying a diverse set of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Notably, our results indicate that ProSECFPs, especially their frequency-aware variants, achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared with established protein sequence descriptors. This enhanced performance arises from their ability to comprehensively integrate amino acid composition and detailed sequence information. ProSECFPs thus provide a robust, adaptable, and highly informative computational representation of proteins, serving as a powerful foundation for addressing interdisciplinary challenges in bioinformatics, genomics, and protein engineering.</p>
