<h2 class="paper-title">Rapid, Growth Factor-Reduced Differentiation of Functional Neurons from hiPSCs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Parker, N. A., Kolawole, O. E., +3 authors, Iyer, N. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introduction: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be rapidly converted into neurons via NGN2 overexpression, but many protocols require costly reagents during the initial induction phase that may limit adoption by labs without routine neuronal differenitation experience. We developed a simplified, low-cost protocol using a tetracyline-inducible (TET-on) NGN2 system in minimal media to generate cortical neurons in as little as 6 days. Methods: KOLF2.1J hiPSCs were stably transfected with a TET-on NGN2 cassette using the nonviral PiggyBac system and induced with doxycycline in Essential 6 media. The impact of adding the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, during doxycycline induction to enhance neurogenesis to was evaluated with immunocytochemistry (ICC) and RT-PCR. Following induction neurons were matured and characterized with ICC for mature neuronal markers and by multielectrode array recordings for functional network activity. Results: DAPT markedly improved conversion efficiency, reducing non-neuronal cells and increasing pan-neuronal TUJ1 expression. Resulting neurons expressed cortical markers and matured into functional glutamatergic neurons. MEA recordings showed spontaneous activity by day 14 and synchronous network firing by day 35. Secondary PB transfection enabled Td-Tomato labelling of KOLF2.1J:pB-TO-NGN2 hiPSCs, allowing 24-hour live imaging of neurite outgrowth. Conclusion: This streamlined, growth-factor-free workflow provides an accessible route for generating functional neurons from patient-derived hiPSCs, including in labs with limited hiPSC or neuronal culture experience.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Designing Cell Cell Relation Extraction Models: A Systematic Evaluation of Entity Representation and Pre-training Strategies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yoshikawa, M., Mizuno, T., +2 authors, Kusuhara, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extracting cell-cell communication (CCC) from biomedical literature is essential for supporting experimental and computational analyses of intercellular interactions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced many NLP tasks, their generative nature raises reliability concerns for scientific fact extraction. This highlights the need for transparent, domain-adapted relation extraction (RE) models. However, despite extensive studies in biomedical RE (BioRE), the fundamental design choices that determine performance (how to indicate entities, how to structure classification models, and whether continued pre-training (CPT) is required) have not been systematically evaluated, particularly for CCC extraction. To address this methodological gap, we conducted the first systematic analysis of core BioRE design decisions using a newly constructed CCC dataset derived from SemMedDB and an independently annotated PubMed test set for out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. CPT had minimal effect on CLS-only models but substantially improved entity-aware architectures. The replacement strategy generalized better to natural text than boundary marking, likely due to reduced reliance on lexical identity. Our best model achieved an OOD accuracy of 0.757, outperforming widely used models such as GPT-4o (0.715) while remaining lightweight and reproducible. This work provides the first dedicated resources and design principles for CCC extraction and establishes a practical foundation for robust BioRE model development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modeling Oxidative Stress-Linked Telogen Effluvium: A Monte Carlo Simulation Using Published Trichoscopy Norms and Cannabis Exposure Distributions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chadha, A., Burmeister, M., Poelker-Wells, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cannabis exposure has increased with greater legalization, yet little is known about cannabis and its possibly relevant impacts on hair biology. The literature suggests that inhalative byproducts and endocannabinoid signaling can affect processes that may affect anagen stability, and, as hair follicles are metabolically active organs susceptible to oxidative and inflammatory damage, they could be affected as well. Therefore, this study intends to understand whether population-based cannabis exposure behaviors statistically correlate with symptoms characteristic of diffuse shedding when applied to a virtual population. A synthetic dataset of 140 individuals was generated using a Monte Carlo framework parameterized by published trichoscopy-based follicular density values, national cannabis use statistics, and psychometric properties reported for hair loss and dermatologic quality of life measures. Cannabis exposure, density, and SAHL scores were sampled from probability distributions specified by published means, standard deviations, and plausible covariance structures rather than from individual-level patient data. The simulated dataset was then subjected to Pearson correlations, linear regression, and ANCOVA with demographic covariates. Higher cannabis exposure was associated with increased SAHL severity (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01) and reduced follicular density (r = -0.38, p &lt; 0.05). Both associations remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment, and female-assigned profiles showed larger effect magnitudes. These associations reflect patterns in the modeled population structure rather than clinical observations, but they parallel mechanistic pathways described in oxidative stress and hair cycle research. As a simulation study, these results cannot establish causality and are limited by underlying assumptions in the source distributions. However, they demonstrate that publicly available data and computational modeling can be combined to generate preliminary hypotheses about how cannabis exposure patterns may align with characteristics observed in telogen effluvium. Future work should integrate empirical biomarkers, longitudinal imaging, and clinical datasets to determine whether these modeled patterns correspond to measurable biological effects.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A foundation model for microbial growth dynamics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Holmes, Z. A., Shyti, I., +28 authors, You, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microbial growth dynamics contain rich information about microbial populations, which support applications from antibiotic testing to microbiome engineering. However, the high dimensionality of growth data and the scarcity of large, task-specific datasets have limited generalizable modeling analysis across systems. Here, we develop a foundation model for microbial growth dynamics. It is a large-scale, self-supervised representation model trained on ~370,000 experimental and simulated growth curves spanning diverse microbial species, environmental conditions, and community contexts. The model learns lower-dimensional latent embeddings that capture essential dynamical features of raw growth data and enable accurate reconstruction of these data. The concise representations enhance predictive performance in diverse downstream applications. Using these embedding, we achieve few-shot learning for antibiotic classification and concentration prediction, accurate forecasting of simulated and experimental communities, and inference of total abundance from relative-abundance data. By extracting transferable representations from heterogeneous datasets, our model provides a general framework for analyzing and predicting microbial community dynamics from limited measurements.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Scalable PBWT Queries with Minimum-Length SMEMConstraints</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Islam, U. I., Cozzi, D., +5 authors, Boucher, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large, phase-resolved haplotype panels -- now emerging from efforts such as UK Biobank, TOPMed, All of Us, and the Mexican Biobank -- enable fine-grained analyses of admixture, local ancestry, and imputation. The Positional Burrows--Wheeler Transform (PBWT) is a natural index for these data, supporting efficient phase-aware matching, but current methods typically enumerate all set-maximal exact matches (SMEMs), incurring unnecessary computation when only long matches are of interest. We introduce PBML, a space- and time-efficient algorithm that enumerates all SMEMs of length at least L. Our approach adapts Boyer-Moore style skipping with a forward-backward traversal of the PBWT, yielding an implementation that avoids auxiliary data structures while restricting search to informative long matches. We evaluate PBML under two querying strategies on two haplotype resources. On the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), PBML achieves up to 38.1% faster index construction than -PBWT, 61.7% faster single-threaded queries (with 22% higher peak memory), and a 305.7% multithreaded speedup (with only 9.4% higher peak memory), demonstrating strong scalability at population scale. We further show that, when targeting long SMEMs (L [≥] 10,000) on 1KGP, PBML reduces total runtime by 73.3% and peak memory usage by 20% relative to L = 1, while still reporting over 1.15 million long SMEMs genome-wide. Finally, we apply PBML to a biobank from the Tennessee Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative and show that, on chromosome 22, setting L between 500 and 1,000 preserves at least 95% single-query coverage (97-99.8% for batches of 5-20 queries) while reducing SMEM counts by 70-83.8% and cutting query time by 37.6%, with speedups up to 92.9% when L = 5,000 and only very long tracts are of interest. Together, these results establish PBML as an efficient and scalable tool to query PBWT-based haplotypes when biologically meaningful matches are the target.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Unified Multi-modal LLM for Dynamic Protein-Ligand Interactions and Generative Molecular Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jing, H., Miao, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BioDynaGen (Biological Dynamics and Generation) is a novel multi-modal framework unifying protein sequences, dynamic binding site conformations, small molecule ligand SMILES, and natural language text into a single discrete token representation. Built upon a general large language model, BioDynaGen employs continuous pre-training and instruction fine-tuning via next-token prediction to address critical gaps in modeling protein dynamics and ligand interactions. This framework enables a diverse range of tasks, including small molecule-protein binding prediction, dynamic pocket design, and ligand-assisted functional generation. By comprehensively integrating these modalities, BioDynaGen offers an advanced framework for understanding and designing complex biological molecular interactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Design principles of neuromorphic computing using genetic circuits</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Britto Bisso, F., Shree, D., +1 author, Cuba Samaniego, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cells have evolved to sense a wide range of input combinations and integrate those signals through signaling pathways to produce context-specific responses, such as differentiation, cell-type specification, and patterning. To replicate this information-processing capacity, synthetic biology has developed large-scale circuitry inspired by the fundamental principles of computer science. Within this framework, neuromorphic computing implemented using genetic circuits offers the opportunity to significantly enhance the computational capabilities of single cells. In this work, we establish design principles for implementing neuromorphic computing in living cells by identifying the key feature that enables a chemical reaction network to function as a perceptron: an input-output mapping with a tunable threshold. We demonstrate that four ubiquitous chemical reaction networks, namely molecular sequestration, catalytic degradation, competitive binding, and activation/deactivation cycles, all satisfy this requirement and can be engineered as perceptrons. By layering these perceptrons into multi-layer architectures, we then show how to construct both linear and nonlinear decision boundaries through rational tuning of production rates that encode network weights. As proof of principle, we apply this framework to design neural networks capable of discriminating between healthy and cancer cells based on gene expression data from 19 tissue types. Together, this work formalizes the design principles for engineering genetic circuits as neural networks and establishes a foundation for implementing next-generation cellular computation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fast prediction of protein flexibility</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Praznikar, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in hardware have made molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein structures faster and more accessible to the scientific community. However, accurately estimating protein flexibility using MD remains computationally demanding, especially for large systems and long time scales. Several MD-based resources - including MdMD, the DynamD database, and more recently ATLAS and mdCATH - now provide MD trajectories for thousands of proteins, enabling the development of predictive models. Here, the Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) is introduced as a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-implement linear model for predicting protein flexibility directly from atom coordinates. GDV is a 15-dimensional feature vector that captures local packing and the spatial connectivity of each atom with its nearby neighbors. Trained on a subset of globular-like proteins from the ATLAS database, the GDV model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.828 compared to MD data. The model trained on ATLAS dataset was further evaluated on independent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and cryo-electron microscopy datasets, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the GDV-based approach. A key advantage of the GDV model is that it requires no additional external or experimental data and can be applied in near real time (on the order of 10 seconds) even for large proteins with 20,000 atoms on a standard desktop or laptop. Overall, the results show that a lightweight, fast, and purely coordinate-based model can provide accurate and generalizable predictions of protein flexibility across diverse folds and sizes. The source code is available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/jure-praznikar/FastProtFlex. The data required for model training are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17771418.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Garcia-Perez, A., Sanchez-Garcia, L., +18 authors, Orgaz, J. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive type of skin cancer with remarkable phenotypic plasticity that contributes to adaptation and resistance to targeted therapies against the MAPK pathway. Previous research described that non-muscle myosin II (NMII) of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell migration and metastasis, is overactivated in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanomas. Since the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BMi) is the current standard of care, we investigated if and how NMII activity is regulated during adaptation to BMi. Here, we find that most dedifferentiating BMi-resistant melanomas overactivate NMII compared to their parental counterparts. NMII activity generally increases during the first 2 weeks of BMi treatment, and it is followed by elevated total NMII levels due partly to transcriptional modulation. Although ERK activity rebounds with similar kinetics, NMII overactivation is not prevented by ERK inhibition but by blockade of ROCK. In melanomas that hyperdifferentiate during adaptation to BMi, NMII activity is not increased upon BMi treatment due, in part, to MITF. We also find that co-targeting NMII along BMi in some melanomas reduces survival of drug-tolerant persister cells, which would delay the development of resistance. Therefore, our study identifies elevated NMII activity as a potential marker of adaptation to MAPK in some melanoma subpopulations, and also provide an approach to delay the emergence of resistance to MAPK-targeted therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">S1PR3 mediates glial stimulated tumor invasion in response to interstitial fluid flow</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cornelison, C., Howerton, S., +16 authors, Munson, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular invasion is a primary challenge to complete resection and treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive and deadly primary brain tumor. The brain tumor microenvironment actively stimulates glioma invasion through a multitude of cellular, chemical, and biophysical cues. We and others have shown elevated interstitial fluid flow at the tumor border is one such biophysical cue that directly stimulates invasion through tumor-intrinsic signaling and, in other tumor types, priming of cancer-associated stromal cells. It is currently unclear if interstitial flow similarly primes neuroglial cells to promote glioma cell dissemination and can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Here, we show elevated interstitial flow upregulates expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in glial astrocytes and microglia, which drives glioma cell invasion via chemotaxis. Flow-induced expression of glial S1PR3 is tumor-independent and displays a biphasic relationship to fluid shear stress magnitude in vitro and flow rate in vivo. Inhibition of glial S1PR3 in a tissue engineered culture model and orthotopic mouse model abrogates flow-stimulated invasion, demonstrating a tumor-extrinsic approach to limiting glioblastoma progression. Given prior evidence of a pro-inflammatory role for glial S1PR3, identification of S1PR3 as a disease-agnostic marker of flow-stimulated glia may also have therapeutic implications across myriad neuropathologies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mammalian Neuraminidase-1 is a Critical Regulator of Platelet-derived Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) T-cell Immunosuppression to Promote Tumor Progression and Metastasis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Harless, W., Li, Y., Szewczuk, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aspirin or celecoxib in combination with chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk for disease recurrence and improved survival after colorectal cancer surgery in the approximately 20% of patients harboring PIK3CA pathway mutations 1,2. Meta-analyses have shown that daily aspirin reduces metastasis in various cancers 3. The biological mechanisms behind the anti-cancer effects of these drugs are an area of intense research interest. Recently, Yang et al found that platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2) inhibits T-cell activity through the expression of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, and that aspirin was able to inhibit ARHGEF1 expression and preserve T-cell functionality and cancer immunity by blocking thromboxane production 4. TXA2 production is inhibited by the effect of aspirin on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, does not inhibit platelet TXA2 production but has shown almost identical efficacy to aspirin in controlled clinical trials 2. Here we show that the enzyme mammalian neuraminidase 1 (NEU-1) is involved in the activation and downstream signaling of the thromboxane receptor in response to TXA2. Both aspirin and celecoxib as well as oseltamivir phosphate (OP) significantly inhibited TXA2-induced NEU-1 activity with subsequently reducing ARHGEF1 expression. This regulation of the TXA2 receptor activation by NEU-1 may explain the contemporaneous results of why both aspirin and celecoxib demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy in the cited trials above despite only aspirin being able to inhibit thromboxane synthesis. Targeting NEU-1 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer progression and metastasis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mitochondrial Integrated Stress Response Activation Creates a Therapeutic Vulnerability to MCL-1 Inhibition in Acute Myeloid Leukemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Brakefield-Laird, L., Budhraja, A., +12 authors, Opferman, J. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) promotes survival and confers therapeutic resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in high-risk subtypes harboring KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r). Clinical trials of patients with hematological malignancies treated with MCL-1 inhibitor monotherapy have revealed dose-limiting toxicity and poor response rates. Therefore, we sought to identify combinatorial treatment approaches to enhance the efficacy of MCL-1 inhibitors with the goal of improving response rates and limiting toxicities. Here, we report the inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I (CI) function as a synthetic lethal partner for MCL-1 inhibition. Co-targeting CI and MCL-1 synergistically reduces the viability in AML cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples in vitro, while significantly prolonging survival in mice bearing PDX AML, indicating the preclinical potential for combinatorial therapy. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale and preclinical evidence for dual inhibition of MCL-1 and CI as a therapeutic strategy, offering a potential path to overcome resistance to single-agent MCL-1 inhibitors and improve outcomes for patients with high-risk AML. Mechanistically, we reveal that CI inhibition induces the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in ATF4 activation downstream of the eIF2 kinase, HRI. The activation of HRI by CI inhibition is dependent on the mitochondrial stress messenger, DELE1. Together, these results indicate that co-inhibition of MCL-1 and ETC CI function has the potential for improving responses in patients with KMT2A-r AML.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Organoid Pharmacotyping of Pancreatic Cancer Enables Functional Precision Oncology and Drug Repurposing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dong, H., Vizeacoumar, F. S., +27 authors, Vizeacoumar, F. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies, with limited benefit from current cytotoxic regimens and poor predictive value of genomics alone. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) represent a promising platform for functional precision oncology, yet systematic pharmacotyping of genomically annotated PDAC PDOs remains sparse. Experimental Design: We established a clinically annotated panel of ten treatment-naive PDAC PDOs spanning well-, moderately-, and poorly differentiated tumors. PDOs were evaluated for morphologic and genomic fidelity and screened against 1,813 clinically relevant small molecules in a high-throughput 384-well format. Drug sensitivities were quantified at the compound and drug-family levels and integrated with histologic grade, pathway-level mutational profiles, and available clinical treatment information. Results: PDOs preserved hallmark tumor features, including glandular organization and subclonal mutational architecture. Pharmacotyping revealed both shared and subtype-specific vulnerabilities. Classical (well/moderately differentiated) PDOs showed enriched mutations in DNA repair, mitotic spindle, and chromatin-regulatory pathways and were preferentially sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors, microtubule poisons, and HDAC inhibitors. In contrast, basal (poorly differentiated) PDOs displayed coordinated defects in mitochondrial function, vesicle trafficking, and ubiquitin-mediated proteostasis, at the pathway level, that conferred a previously unrecognized vulnerability to cardiac glycosides. Sensitivities to standard PDAC agents were heterogeneous across models, underscoring the limited predictive value of genotype alone and the need for functional drug testing. Conclusions: This integrated genomic and pharmacologic analysis demonstrates that PDO pharmacotyping identifies biologically grounded, actionable vulnerabilities in PDAC, including novel therapeutic opportunities in basal, chemo-resistant tumors. These findings support PDO-guided functional profiling as a clinically relevant platform for refining drug selection and expanding treatment options for patients with PDAC. Significance: PDAC is dominated by chemoresistance and lacks reliable genomic predictors of therapy response. By integrating high-throughput drug screening with mutation-informed pathway analysis in patient-derived organoids, we identify differentiation-linked therapeutic liabilities, including a previously unrecognized vulnerability to cardiac glycosides in basal PDAC. These results highlight PDO pharmacotyping as a powerful functional complement to genomics for guiding treatment selection in pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Huynh, K., Barcik Weissman, S. N., +6 authors, Modrek, A. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor that inevitably recurs after chemoradiotherapy, resulting in poor patient outcomes. Given GBM cellular heterogeneity, we hypothesized that radiation induces sub-population specific alterations to survive and adapt to radiation stress. We performed integrated single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses in Glioma Stem-Like Cultures three hours after they were exposed to clinically relevant radiation doses. Radiation reshaped the cellular landscape, altering both cell type composition and GBM subtype distribution. Cluster-specific and shared transcriptional programs were induced in a dose-dependent manner, with differentially expressed genes enriching distinct biological pathways. Chromatin accessibility analyses revealed parallel cluster-specific remodeling, with both opening and closing of regulatory elements linked to functional pathway shifts. Notably, 2 Gy and 6 Gy exposures elicited conserved transcriptional profiles in RNA clusters across different radiation doses. Together, these results highlight immediate radiation-induced transcriptional and chromatin remodeling programs in GBM at single-cell resolution and identify conserved cluster-specific adaptations that may underlie therapeutic resistance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Gut microbiome-mediated transformation of dietary phytonutrients is associated with health outcomes.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu Zhang, Andrea Marfil-Sánchez, +8 authors, Gianni Panagiotou</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Food, especially plant-based diet, has complex chemical diversity. However, large-scale phytonutrient-metabolizing activities of gut bacteria are largely unknown. Here we integrated and systematically analysed multiple databases containing information on enzymatic reactions and food health benefits, and 3,068 global public human microbiomes. Transformation of 775 phytonutrients from edible plants was associated with enzymes encoded by diverse gut microbes. In vitro assays validated the biotransformation activity of gut species, for example, Eubacterium ramulus. The biotransformation of phytonutrients demonstrated high interpersonal and geographical variability. Machine learning models based on 2,486 public case-control microbiomes, using the abundances of enzymes associated with modification of phytonutrients present in health-associated foods, discriminated the health status of individuals in multiple disease contexts, suggesting altered biotransformation potential in disease. We validated the association of microbiome-encoded enzymes with the anti-inflammatory activity of common edible plants by combining metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis in specific-pathogen-free and germ-free mice. These findings have implications for designing precise, personalized diets to guide an individual towards a healthy state.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PixlMap: A generalisable pixel classifier for cellular phenotyping in multiplex immunofluorescence images.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rachel L Baird, David Mason, +7 authors, John Le Quesne</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multiplexed methods for the detection of protein expression generate extremely data-rich images of intact tissue sections. These images are invaluable for the quantification and analysis of complex biology and biomarker development. However, their interpretation presents a considerable analytical challenge. Cell segmentation from images is a key bottleneck and a major focus of research activity in artificial intelligence. Most current methods depend initially on the use of a nuclear counterstain to identify nuclear boundaries, which is a relatively straightforward task. The cellular boundary is then assigned either by expansion of the nuclear outline, or by the use of membrane or cytoplasm-specific stains to delineate cell boundaries, or by some combination of the two. The task is critical, as inaccurate segmentation leads to information loss and data contamination from neighbouring cells. Increasingly sophisticated methods are being developed to address these issues, but each has its own shortcomings. We present an alternative method which is inspired by the fact that the assignation of a cellular phenotype 'by eye' does not depend upon the accurate identification of cell boundaries. We present an easy-to-use deep learning-based cellular phenotyping method which leverages this human capacity to assign phenotypes without segmenting the entire cell, and which can accurately phenotype cells based on nuclear segmentation alone. Using human ground truth annotations of entire cellular regions, we developed a classifier leveraging the U-Net architecture within a commercially available deep learning image analysis platform, but the principle is transferrable to any deep-learning framework. Crucially, training requires only a single example of each compartmental stain (nuclear/cytoplasmic/membranous). The resulting algorithm assigns class identities to cells with nuclear labelling alone, without the need for whole cell expansion. The method is highly novel, broadly generalisable, and comparable in accuracy to intensity-based phenotyping methods, bridging the gap between inaccurate cellular segmentation and accurate phenotype generation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Advances in surrogate modeling for biological agent-based simulations: trends, challenges, and future prospects.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kerri-Ann Norton, Daniel Bergman, +1 author, Trachette Jackson</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful computational approach for studying complex biological and biomedical systems, yet its widespread use remains limited by significant computational demands. As models become increasingly sophisticated, the number of parameters and interactions rises rapidly, exacerbating the so-called "curse of dimensionality" and making comprehensive parameter exploration and uncertainty analyses computationally prohibitive. A growing body of work points to surrogate modeling as a powerful approach for approximating the dynamics of agent-based models, providing computationally efficient pathways for tasks such as parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. In this review, we examine traditional approaches for performing these tasks directly within ABMs-providing a baseline for comparison-and then synthesize recent developments in surrogate-assisted methodologies for biological and biomedical applications. We cover statistical, mechanistic, and machine-learning-based approaches, emphasizing emerging hybrid strategies that integrate mechanistic insights with machine learning to balance interpretability and scalability. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline directions for future research, including the development of standardized benchmarks to enhance methodological rigor and facilitate the broad adoption of surrogate-assisted ABMs in biology and medicine.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Maiti S, Tripathi S, +12 authors, Kriwacki RW.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomolecular condensates mediate dynamic compartmentalization of cellular processes. The multivalent interactions that underlie biomolecular condensation are often promoted by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within proteins. Although the role of IDRs in biomolecular condensates is well appreciated, predicting whether an IDR forms condensates in cells remains challenging. Here, we developed a machine learning model to accurately predict the condensation behavior of IDRs, analyzing 215 IDRs from fusion oncoproteins in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. We identified distinct sequence-derived physicochemical features associated with condensation. Leveraging these data, our model predicts that ~12% of the ~13,000 IDRs in the human proteome are likely to form cellular condensates, establishing a robust framework for proteome-wide analysis of IDR-mediated biomolecular condensation. Notably, proteins with condensate-forming IDRs are significantly enriched in RNA processing and splicing functions and are predominantly localized to membraneless organelles, highlighting a central role of IDR-mediated biomolecular condensation in cellular organization and RNA biology.</p>
