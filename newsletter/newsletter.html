<h2 class="paper-title">Energy-guided combinatorial co-optimization of antibody affinity and stability</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tennenhouse, A., Mechaly, A., +8 authors, Fleishman, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Affinity maturation is an essential process in antibody engineering. Although powerful, it is iterative and time-consuming and can result in trade-offs, where affinity is gained at the cost of other essential properties, such as specificity and stability. Here, we present a scalable structure- and energy-based strategy, called LAffAb, that starts from a crystallographic structure of the bound antibody-antigen complex and introduces combinations of mutations to optimize the energy. A combinatorial mutation library comprising 7,000 variants with up to nine mutations results in large gains of up to 1,000-fold in affinity while co-optimizing antibody stability. Surprisingly, the library does not converge on a single solution; instead, it favors diverse variants with a high mutational load. Applied in small scale (10 designs) to an antibody targeting a potential drug target, designs improved affinity by an order of magnitude with little loss in specificity or stability. We envision that LAffAb can be used to select stable, specific, and high-affinity binders and to improve our understanding of sequence, structure, and function relationships in antibodies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Decoding Gene Responsiveness to Synthetic Chromatin Reader-Actuators with Multi-Modal Epigenomic Profiling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kim, S. H., Enwerem-Lackland, I., +3 authors, Haynes, K. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell identity is regulated by chromatin states that encode gene regulatory memory and shape responses to new inputs. To investigate how chromatin context influences inducibility in differentiated cells, we employed engineered synthetic reader-actuators (SRAs), fusion proteins containing the polycomb chromodomain (PCD) that binds H3K27me3. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, we mapped PCD-fusion occupancy by ChIP-seq and used RNA-seq to identify temporally resolved gene activation patterns. ChIP-seq profiling and machine learning models (MLM) demonstrated that PCD-fusion binding was predicted by the presence of H3K27me3, H4K20me1, or H3K36me3 enrichment, suggesting selective accessibility at enhancers and chromatin transition zones. Among genes with PCD-fusion enriched enhancers, the SRA-induced subset was distinguished by promoter features including bivalent histone modifications and enrichment of transcriptional repressors REST and MTA1. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SRA responsiveness depends on a specific chromatin signature beyond H3K27me3 alone. This study demonstrates the power of SRAs to dissect inducible chromatin features in their native genomic context, and suggests that epigenetically repressed regions in differentiated cells can retain regulatory plasticity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tuning Yeast Glycosylation Proximal to the FLS2-flg22 Binding Interface enables Functional Yeast Surface Display under Induced ER Stress</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dolgikh, B., Schulte, S., Woldring, D. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pattern recognition receptors such as FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) are central to plant immunity and attractive targets for engineering broader detection of bacterial phytopathogens. However, evaluating numerous FLS2 variants directly in plants is slow and low throughput, and have been seldom optimized for heterologous display systems. Here, we established conditions that enabled Arabidopsis thaliana FLS2 ectodomain functional expression on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and binding to its cognate ligand, flg22. We show how yeast high-mannose glycosylation of the FLS2 ectodomain contributes to inefficient folding and loss of detectable flg22 binding in standard yeast surface display conditions. Substitutions at all N-glycosylation motifs compromised surface expression, indicating that some glycosylation is required for trafficking. We tuned the extent of glycosylation using tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, in combination with thermal stress to modulate ER quality control. Under these conditions, we observed a reproducible subpopulation of cells with improved flg22 binding despite reduced overall expression, and we confirmed flg22 selectivity using both flow cytometry and magnetic bead-based enrichment. Guided by structural modeling of high-mannose glycans on the FLS2 ectodomain, we then substituted asparagines at selected N-glycan sites. We identified a key glycan site variant, N388, which lies proximal to the flg22 binding interface and enhanced functional expression under stress conditions. Together, these results reveal that lineage-specific glycosylation patterns and ER stress responses critically shape the functional display of FLS2 in yeast. This approach provides a framework for engineering yeast surface display platforms for high-throughput screening of FLS2 and related immune receptors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A multi-step filtering pipeline for human read removal enhances detection of Fusobacterium in WGS datasets with immunohistochemical confirmation in mucinous rectal cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Frolova, M. S., Maguire, B., +8 authors, Prehn, J. H. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of tumour-associated microbiomes using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has attracted considerable attention, but microbial signal detection remains controversial due to host contamination and methodological artefacts. As the necessity of human-read removal becomes increasingly evident, many groups now include this step in their data pre-processing workflows. In this work, we introduce an open-source tool designed for rigorous host-read removal and apply it to the reanalysis of WGS data from ten mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma cases originally published by Reynolds et al. The workflow integrates k-mer-based classification (Kraken2), quality and adapter trimming (Trim Galore), vector filtering (BBDuk/UniVec_Core), and duplicate-removal (FastUniq). After reducing data complexity, a multi-aligner, multi-reference approach (BWA-MEM/GRCh38, Bowtie2/T2T-CHM13, Minimap2/HPRC v1.1) removes remaining host sequences, collectively eliminating more than 99.9% of human-derived reads. Although the additional alignment steps eliminated only a small fraction of total reads, they consistently removed millions of residual sequences per sample, underscoring the importance of rigorous filtering in datasets where non-human reads are a small minority. Taxonomic profiling with PathSeq and MetaPhlAn revealed reproducible enrichment of Fusobacterium species in tumour versus matched normal tissues, with stricter filtering reducing overall microbial signal compared to prior results. Cross-validation with immunofluorescence analysis using pan-Fusobacterium (detecting both F. animalis and F. nucleatum) and F. nucleatum-specific antibodies showed a strong concordance with Fusobacterium subspecies detected by WGS. Compared to the unfiltered analysis, host depletion markedly reduced artificial microbial signals in normal samples while preserving tumour-associated Fusobacterium, resulting in a more reliable microbial profile.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cross-chemical and cross-species toxicity prediction: benchmarkingand a novel 3D-structure-based deep learning model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yuan, R., Shaw, J., +1 author, Ye, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prediction of a compound's toxicity is a key step toward realizing animal-free testing of chemical compounds. Recent advances have yielded significant progress in computational toxicity prediction, including machine learning methods that utilize chemical fingerprints and deep learning-based latent representations. However, challenges remain, primarily due to the lack of clean training datasets and the inconsistent model performance. To address these challenges, we curated a comprehensive dataset of aquatic toxicity from seven data sources, which contains 50,603 records for 5,889 compounds across 2,285 different species, much larger than similar datasets used in previous studies. We also developed tox-learn, a Python library featuring tools for automated dataset cleaning, machine learning methods and performance evaluation. The library places special emphasis on avoiding overestimation of prediction accuracy caused by improper train-test data splitting. Based on this toolbox, we benchmarked various predictive models using different train-test splitting strategies on the curated dataset. Our results showed that the choice of machine learning method, molecular fingerprint, and train-test splitting strategy all significantly affect performance. We demonstrated that incorporating species information generally improved predictions, although the degree of improvement depended on how this information was represented. In addition, we developed a new 3D structure-based deep-learning model, 3DMol-Tox, which achieves regression accuracy comparable to the best 2D-structure based model (GPBoost) while exhibiting consistently higher within-one-bin (W1B) classification accuracy. Finally, we analyzed the impact of different train-test splitting strategies and provide recommendations based on our benchmarking, such as using structure-aware splitting to mitigate information leakage, a common issue that inflates reported model performance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative metagenomics using pan-metagenomics graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Coleman, I., Mametyarova, N., +14 authors, Korem, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying microbial genomic factors underlying human phenotypes is a key goal of microbiome research. Sequence graphs are a highly effective tool for genome comparisons because they enable high-resolution de novo analyses that capture and contextualize complex genomic variation. However, applying sequence graphs to complex microbial communities remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of metagenomic data. Existing multi-sample sequence graphs used in these settings are highly complex, computationally expensive, less accurate than single-sample alternatives, and often involve arbitrary coarse-graining. Here, we present copangraph, a multi-sample sequence-graph-based analysis framework for comprehensive comparisons of genomic variation across metagenomes. Copangraph uses a novel homology-based graph, which provides both non-arbitrary, evolutionary-motivated grouping of sequences into the same node as well as flexibility in the scale of variation represented by the graph. Its construction relies on hybrid coassembly, a new coassembly approach in which single-sample graphs are first constructed separately and are then merged to create a multi-sample graph. We also present an algorithm that uses paired-end reads to improve detection of contiguous genomic regions, increasing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that copangraph captures sequence and variant information more accurately than alternative methods, provides graphs that are more suitable for comparative analysis than de Bruijn graphs, and is computationally tractable. We show that copangraph reflects meaningful metagenomic variation across diverse scenarios. Importantly, it enables significantly better performance than other metagenomic representations when predicting the gut colonization trajectories of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Our results underscore the value of our multi-sample, graph-based framework for comparative metagenomic analyses.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RNA-X: Modeling RNA interactions to design binder RNA and simultaneously target multiple molecules of different types</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shukueian Tabrizi, S., Hashemi Aghdam, H., Cicek, A. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract RNA interactions with proteins, other RNA molecules, and DNA play essential roles in numerous cellular processes and underpin a wide range of therapeutic mechanisms. Consequently, modeling these interactions is critical for understanding biological systems and designing novel RNA-based therapeutics. However, designing RNA sequences that selectively and strongly bind to a specific target remains a major challenge due to the vast sequence space and the current limitations of experimental and computational methods. In this study, we introduce RNA-X, the first RNA interaction foundation model which is based on masked language modeling for representation learning, conditional RNA design, and optimization. For the first time, RNA-X enables (i) RNA design targeting not only proteins but also other RNA and DNA molecules, and (ii) simultaneous design against multiple targets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA-X generates RNA sequences with natural structural characteristics and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in protein targeting. Using affinity predictors and molecular dynamics simulations, we further show that the model can design RNA molecules that (i) target therapeutically relevant molecules such as p53 and thrombin proteins, and (ii) bind to targets with no prior interaction data, such as SDAD1 protein. As a proof of concept, we designed a novel guide RNA from scratch that simultaneously binds (i) to the DNA of a bacterium and (ii) to the Cas9 protein. The resulting design achieves a predicted binding energy comparable to that of the wild-type guide RNA reported in the Protein Data Bank. Despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters than existing RNA foundation models, RNA-X produces representations that outperform them across diverse RNA interaction-related downstream tasks. The code and pretrained model are publicly available on https://github.com/ciceklab/RNA-X.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Melanoma Brain Metastasis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yavuz, B. R., Jang, H., Nussinov, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Brain metastasis is a major contributor to melanoma related mortality, arising from both genomic alterations and dynamic adaptations to the brain microenvironment. Tumor cells must cross the blood-brain barrier and exploit brain specific signaling and metabolic landscapes to establish metastases. Brain metastases display molecular and phenotypic programs distinct from other organs, reflecting pre-existing and acquired mutations during progression. We analyzed primary melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and metastatic brain tumors genomic datasets to identify mutated proteins and signaling pathways that are common to or distinct among these tumor types. Our comprehensive computational analyses uncovered key pathways and proteins associated with brain metastasis. Brain metastases exhibit unique mutational landscapes and convergent alterations in neurotrophin, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling compared with primary and metastatic melanoma. Proteins especially frequent in brain metastases pathways support survival, proliferation, and adaptation in the brain microenvironment. Pharmacology-wise, rational strategies such as combining c-KIT and VEGFR inhibitors can suppress converging oncogenic pathways and mitigate resistance in advanced melanoma. Co-targeting neurotrophin receptors with MAPK pathway members, particularly in combination with BRAF inhibitors, appears a promising approach for treating melanoma brain metastases. Our findings underscore the molecular heterogeneity of melanoma brain metastases, shaped by interconnected signaling networks, and reveal therapeutic targets that may diverge from those in other metastatic sites.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">STODE: A Deep Generative Framework for Continuous Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Spatial Transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Majima, K., Kojima, Y., Shimamura, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics offers detailed molecular insights but struggles to capture continuous tissue dynamics due to experimental constraints and destructive sampling. Traditional optimal transport (OT) methods attempt to link time points but often rely on unimodal data and oversimplify complex developmental processes. We propose a spatiotemporal deep generative model that captures the continuous evolution of tissue, integrating both spatial and gene-expression dynamics. We first embed spatial transcriptomic particles into a latent space using a VAE and then learn time-dependent dynamics with a potential-guided neural ODE. This framework reveals diverse tissue behaviors, including growth patterns, spatial reorganization, and temporal gene-expression changes. A neural decoder estimates key behaviors like growth, disappearance, movement, and clustering, while a differentiable growth module models region appearance and disappearance.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer cachexia involves systemic metabolic deregulation along with classical features of muscle wasting, lipolysis, and chronic inflammation. While tumor non-autonomous effects on peripheral organs are recognized, how the tumor rewires the circulating immune cells and hematopoiesis remains unclear. We utilized a Drosophila larval cancer cachexia model by expressing yki3SA in the adult midgut precursors (AMP), which gives rise to a tumor in the larval midgut and recapitulates key cachectic phenotypes, including insulin resistance. Tumor-induced cachexia results in perturbed blood cell homeostasis with a reduced niche and aberrant blood cell differentiation in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland (LG). Bulk RNA-seq analysis of circulating hemocytes from tumor-bearing larvae revealed upregulation of multiple cachectic ligands, notably ImpL2, an insulin antagonist. We demonstrate that elevated ImpL2 levels reduce LG niche size and promote aberrant blood cell differentiation. Elevated ImpL2 levels and systemic insulin resistance in the tumor-induced cachexia conditions result in abrogation of insulin signaling in the niche-progenitor micro-environment in the LG. DE-cadherin levels in the primary LG lobe are perturbed, and Wingless signaling is down-regulated, driving prohemocyte differentiation. A genetic mimic of systemic ImpL2 overexpression or high sugar diet (HSD) conditions recapitulates these LG phenotypes due to abrogation of the Insulin-Wingless signaling axis. Hemocyte-specific ImpL2 depletion in HSD-fed larvae rescued these defects, suggesting a regulatory role for circulating hemocyte-derived ImpL2. Our findings reveal that hemocyte-derived factors actively contribute to systemic insulin resistance, causing hematopoietic remodeling in cancer cachexia.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ASD: Antigen-Specific Antibody Database</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Czerwinski, A., Dudzic, P., +7 authors, Krawczyk, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The development of computational models addressing therapeutic antibodies faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of data. A critical data element is the set of antibody-antigen interaction pairs associated with sequences. To address this issue, we developed the Antigen Specific Antibody Database (ASD, https://naturalantibody.com/agab/), a database aggregating antibody-antigen interaction data from multiple studies with standardized formatting and annotations. Our dataset compilation strategy resulted in data from 15 distinct sources, resulting in 1,097,946 unique antibody-antigen interactions (with 9,575 unique antigens). The ASD database captures diverse affinity measures and qualitative binding assessment, along with metadata including UniProt and PDB identifiers, target protein names, confidence levels, and experimental conditions. Through this integration drive, we make available an ample resource of interaction data gathered from the public domain to act as a foundation for model development and further data generation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Candidate correlates of protection in the HVTN505 HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial identified by positive-unlabeled learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shiwei Xu, Aaron Hudson, +2 authors, Margaret E Ackerman</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With a goal of unveiling mechanisms by which vaccines can provide protection against HIV-1 acquisition, several studies have explored correlates of risk of HIV-1 acquisition in HVTN 505, which was a phase IIb trial conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a DNA plasmid and recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-vectored HIV vaccine regimen among individuals in the United States who were vulnerable to acquiring HIV. While this trial failed to meet its predetermined efficacy criteria, both immunological and virological correlates of reduced risk of acquisition have been reported, suggesting that at least some vaccine recipients were protected from some viruses. In this work, we describe application of a novel Positive-Unlabeled machine learning-based approach to infer protection status among vaccine recipients that did not acquire HIV, resulting in improved power to detect potential correlates of immunity. Having established the analytical robustness of protection status predictions using cross-validation and permutation testing strategies, we report increased confidence in previously identified correlates of risk, such as vaccine-elicited anti-HIV-1 Env glycoprotein IgG3 antibodies and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, and the new observation of an inverse correlation between inferred vaccine-mediated protection and virus-specific IgA responses. Though its biological validity is not established, this inference approach offers a new means to use case-control datasets to identify candidate markers of effective immune responses in the context of low vaccine efficacy.</p>
