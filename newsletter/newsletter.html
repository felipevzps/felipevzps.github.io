<h2 class="paper-title">Widespread data leakage inflates performance estimates in cancer drug response prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Asiaee, A., Strauch, J., +4 authors, Coombes, K. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drug response prediction models are widely used to nominate biomarkers and guide pre-clinical drug prioritization. However, their reported performance hinges on rigorous separation of training and test data during cross-validation (CV). Here we show that a commonly used pattern---supervised feature screening performed on the full dataset before CV---introduces data leakage that systematically underestimates prediction error. Analyzing 265 drugs across 1,462 cancer cell lines, we find that leakage-free CV increases mean squared error (MSE) by 16.6%, with low feature-set overlap between leaked and leakage-free pipelines (mean Jaccard 0.18). A manual audit of 12 recent deep learning and classical methods found confirmed leakage in 10. Such inflated performance estimates likely contribute to computational predictions that fail during independent validation or experimental follow-up. We provide an audit guide and reference implementation to prevent leakage, and introduce a tissue-aware Data Shared Elastic Net (DSEN) that, under correct evaluation, improves prediction for 65.7% of drugs while yielding sparser, more targeted biomarker sets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Natural language-based representation and modeling of RBP binding</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Elhajjajy, S., Weng, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of the human transcriptome, but the binding patterns of most RBPs are insufficiently characterized. While sequence context facilitates RBP binding specificity, its precise contribution remains unclear. Existing computational methods to decipher RBP binding patterns are limited by their architecture-dependence, challenging interpretability, and, importantly, lack of focus on context. We present a novel comprehensive approach to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps. We first introduce a natural language-based representation to model RNA sequences using lexical, syntactic, and semantic forms, then devise a sequence decomposition method based on these structures to deconstruct RNA sequences into regions, each containing a target k-mer and its flanking contexts. We leverage this linguistic conceptualization to predict RBP binding under a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, which we solve using a novel method of significant region extraction termed "iterative relabeling". We demonstrate that our bottom-up approach discovers key regions contributing to RBP binding in an architecture-dependent, accurate, and interpretable manner.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Effects of Spin4 ablation in aging mice: body composition, bone density, and malignancy prevalence</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lui, J. C., Hannula, I., +2 authors, Baron, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many overgrowth syndromes are associated with increased risk of tumorigenesis and malignancies. Our group recently identified a frameshift variant in histone reader SPIN4 located on the X chromosome to be a new genetic cause for human overgrowth. In the current study, we investigated the prevalence of malignancies, along with body weight, body length, body composition and bone mineral density, in Spin4 knockout mice at 18 months of age. We found that male mice lacking Spin4 have increased number of tumors and increased body length, while body weight, body composition and bone mineral density were comparable with wild-type mice. We also analyzed publicly available expression data in various types of human cancers and looked for increased or decreased expression of genes that are implicated in overgrowth syndromes and act through epigenetic mechanisms. We found that the expression of SPIN4, EZH2, and DNMT3A to be elevated in many human cancers compared to the corresponding non-malignant tissue samples. Taken together, our current findings confirm that loss of SPIN4 causes overgrowth in mice (in terms of body length) and is associated with increased prevalence in neoplasia; but does not appear to affect adiposity or bone density.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Chromatin architecture and physical constriction cooperate in phenotype switching and cancer cell dissemination</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Berico, P., Dunton, C., +21 authors, Hernando, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phenotypic plasticity is a prominent cancer feature that contributes to metastatic potential and resistance to therapy across multiple cancer types. Cancer cell state transitions have been attributed to transcriptional programs, such as the AP1/TEAD-regulated gene network driving the mesenchymal-like (MES) phenotype. In addition, during dissemination, tumor cells are subjected to variable loads of physical mechanical pressure and constriction across transited tissue, which are thought to impact nuclear molecular crowding. How the interplay between mechanical pressure, global 3D nuclear architecture and transcriptional programs contributes to MES identity and metastatic adaptation remains unclear. Using cutaneous melanoma as a model for early dissemination, we integrate in vitro and in vivo epigenomic profiling with nanoscale imaging of cell lines and patient samples to investigate chromatin organization features underlying the MES phenotype. We find that in MES cells, CTCF is relocated from domain boundaries to regulatory regions of EMT-like genes, leading to reduced insulation, extended topological associated domains (TADs) and increased inter-domain contacts, and de novo formation of chromatin hubs. This conformational rewiring, along with loss of heterochromatin, supports nuclear deformability during invasion and dissemination. Conversely, physical constriction of melanocytic cells induces MES-like chromatin features, including CTCF repositioning and heterochromatin loss, and promotes metastasis in vivo. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 triggers MES characteristics and increases invasiveness. These results demonstrate that metastatic competency involves both epigenetic and structural nuclear reprogramming, enabling shifts in gene networks and physical adaptability. Our findings reveal mechanistic links between nuclear architecture and aggressive tumor behavior, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to intercept metastatic progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Recurrent Escape from Osimertinib-Induced Senescence Promotes Genomic Instability Associated with Therapeutic Resistance</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mcdaid, H., Jamil, N., +2 authors, Hosgood, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acquired resistance to osimertinib remains a major challenge in treating EGFR-mutant (EGFR+) Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Although most patients initially respond to treatment, relapses are universal, even after prolonged remission during which tumor dormancy occurs. Here, we show that osimertinib induces and maintains senescence in EGFR+ NSCLC. Importantly, osimertinib does not kill senescent cells; however, following drug withdrawal, cells escape and resume proliferation. To examine the consequences of recurrent senescence and escape on resistance, we generated four isogenic cell lines clonally expanded through sequential cycles of Osimertinib-Induced Senescence (OsIS). Phylogenetic reconstruction based on de novo somatic variants revealed that these lines form four distinct evolutionary clades with varying degrees of osimertinib resistance. All had elevated tumor mutational burden with distinct single-nucleotide and copy-number variants, and without acquisition of tertiary EGFR mutations or MET amplification. Resistance was predominately associated with chromosomal instability characterized by extensive loss of heterozygosity, high copy-number alteration burden, and mutational signatures consistent with replication-associated DNA damage and repair. A second resistance genotype exhibited extreme focal amplifications with breakage-fusion-bridge-like genome remodeling. Despite profound genomic instability, targeting DNA repair or replication stress pathways was ineffective, whereas sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy was retained across clades. Collectively, these findings indicate that recurrent senescence escape drives osimertinib resistance through widespread genomic instability and is most effectively treated by cytotoxic strategies rather than pathway-targeted approaches.</p>
