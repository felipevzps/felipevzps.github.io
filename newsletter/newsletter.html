<h2 class="paper-title">Model-based Standardization of Correlation Coefficients Improves Multi-Omic Clustering and Biological Signal Discovery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Robinson, M., Noh, H., +1 author, Rappoport, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multi-omic data pose a particular challenge for Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WCNA or WGCNA) due to (platform- or) batch-specific characteristics, such as resolution, accuracy, dynamic range, and sources of spurious variation. When unaccounted for, these differences can result in a bias toward single-batch clusters as well as greater sensitivity to "noisier" batches during clustering. Here we propose mitigating these effects using null models fitted separately to the bulk of analyte-analyte correlations within each batch and across each pair of batches. We then map the batch-specific null models to a standard null model, removing batch-dependent distributional differences. This approach is compatible with any correlation-based clustering approach. Since the null model represents information not captured in individual pairwise correlations, we show how to incorporate this additional information into both distance-based clustering and WCNA. For distance-based clustering, we increase distances corresponding to correlations consistent with the null model. For WCNA, we provide a new soft threshold (adjacency) function based on the likelihood of a correlation under the null model. The resulting network can be easily incorporated into the WCNA workflow. These methods are implemented in R package standardcor, and we illustrate the package on simulated data as well as an existing multi-omic dataset.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BiosInt: Biosensor-based smart design of pathway dynamic regulation for industrial biomanufacturing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Martin Lazaro, H., Otero-Muras, I., Carbonell, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Industrial-scale production of bio-based chemicals in the circular green bioeconomy still faces inefficiencies arising from scaling up challenges. Biosensor-mediated control of metabolic pathways has been proposed as a strategy to improve the performance of those bioprocesses. By linking industrial biosynthetic pathways to measurable metabolites through biochemical transformations, a highly interconnected regulatory design space is unveiled, offering new opportunities for pathway dynamic control. Yet, a systematic approach for selecting and implementing genetic circuits within such large space has remained absent. Here, we introduce BiosInt, an allosteric transcription factor-based genetic biocircuit, with quasi-integral adaptation control capabilities that can be used to increase robustness and performance of biomanufacturing engineered strains. To test the capabilities of the circuit, we have analysed its performance for the full set of metabolic pathway topologies found in the bio-based chemical production space of compounds with industrial interest. For a given implementation of the BiosInt circuit, we carried out a multiobjective optimization process that provides the inverse control solution of optimal topology starting from any given pathway configuration and enzyme expression ratios. Next, synthetic datasets are generated to train machine learning-based predictive models with the data obtained from the simulations of each topology by varying enzyme expression levels and their corresponding concentrations. We validated the models by showing their ability to predict the best control topology for a given set of enzyme ratios. As a proof-of-concept, we show its application to the design of the genetic constructs expressing flavonoid production pathways, providing optimal performance for the BiosInt-mediated dynamic regulation. This circuit inverse design and its application to dynamic control in biomanufacturing paves the way for a future design pipeline in biofoundries delivering more robust and efficient sustainable bioproduction processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Development of a metabolic signature of post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wolthuis, J., Magnusdottir, S., +6 authors, Kies, A., de Ridder, J., van Mil, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the agricultural sector, antibiotics have been used to improve swine growth performance. This application is banned nowadays, due to increased risk of antibiotic resistance. In piglets this results in a higher prevalence of post-weaning diarrhoea, deteriorating both animal health and performance. Our goal was to find a metabolite signature separating piglets with low faecal consistency score (FCS) from piglets with normal faecal consistency and determine which pathways were enriched in this signature. By using direct infusion mass spectrometry on blood spots, we built machine learning (ML) models that aimed to differentiate between low and normal FCS. To test the general predictive capability of these models, we applied a Leave-One-Country-Out (LOCO) strategy for cross validation. Our second approach after LOCO was finding the optimal number of features to include in a feature-reduced model. To determine the order in which features were to be eliminated, we ranked them based on a combination of t-test and fold-change significance scores. Enrichment analysis using mummichog was used to gain insights into the final signature set of m/z values found using this ranking and ML models. Models trained both using all countries and leaving out specific countries from training showed a limited ability to predict FCS category. Furthermore, the LOCO results were mixed, with some countries showing a predictive signal present in the data, but others with predictive capability that was no better than random. Signature analysis using t-test and fold-change results did not result in any KEGG pathways that were enriched in this signature as compared to random. Using these methods, we could predict the FCS category to a limited degree. Although no common signature for low faecal consistency could be determined using this method, given that some countries showed more reliable LOCO results, further analysis into specifically the samples from those countries could be a valuable next step. No metabolite signature enriched in changes to KEGG pathways was found in the data using the combined t-test and fold-change analysis ranking method. We have shared the data with the community through the MetaboLights repository.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProtAttn-QuadNet: An attention-based deep learning framework for protein-protein interaction prediction using ProtBERT embeddings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Islam, M. S., Mim, M. M. R., Kabir, M. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the backbone of most cellular processes, governing signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolic control. However, experimental approaches to identifying PPIs remain expensive, laborious, and often incomplete. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based PPI prediction by enabling deep contextual encoding of biochemical and structural information directly from amino acid sequences. Building upon this progress, we present ProtAttn-QuadNet, an attention-based deep learning framework that leverages ProtBERT embeddings to model reciprocal dependencies between protein pairs. The proposed model employs a quad-stream attention mechanism that integrates individual protein features, synergistic interactions, and complementary differences through multi-level self- and cross-attention layers. This architecture enables the discovery of fine-grained relational patterns while ensuring balanced bidirectional modeling of interacting proteins. Evaluated on large-scale dataset from UniProt, ProtAttn-QuadNet achieves 97.18% accuracy (AUC-ROC 99.30%) on balanced data and 99.23% accuracy (AUC-ROC 99.80%) on oversampled datasets, surpassing several recent state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods. Statistical validation using Chi-square and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirms the significance and reliability of the models predictions. ProtAttn-QuadNet offers a powerful computational framework for large-scale PPI prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AstroLogics: A simulation-based analysis framework for monotonous Boolean model ensemble</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pankaew, S., Noel, V., +3 authors, Calzone, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Boolean networks (BNs) have emerged as versatile tools for modeling cellular regulatory mechanisms due to their ability to capture key biological features despite their simplicity. Multiple BN synthesis methods, which aim to infer BNs with dynamics that corresponding to the experimental data, have emerged in a recent decade. However, these methods often posed a challenge as multiple BN candidates or "model ensemble" can be generated. While these ensembles are valuable for representing cell populations and their heterogeneity, current methods typically treat them as single components without examining their constituent features. We present AstroLogics, a novel framework designed to analyze and identify differences in both dynamical behavior and logical regulation within BN model ensembles. The framework calculates dynamical distances between BNs through exploration of their state transition graphs (STGs), enabling clustering of similarly functioning models that may represent different cellular fates or signaling mechanisms. AstroLogics also identifies key logical properties that govern each cluster, highlighting the core regulatory structures that differentiate model behaviors. Our approach leverages MaBoSS, a stochastic simulation tool that implements the Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm to address time interpretation in BNs. This probabilistic approximation method allows efficient probing of BN dynamics through stochastic simulations, overcoming the computational limitations of exhaustive STG analysis. Our framework also provides powerful visualization and classification capabilities for model ensembles. Through multiple use cases, we demonstrate how AstroLogics facilitates comprehensive analysis of model diversity, and discovery of key regulatory structures within BN ensembles.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Primer Blind Spots: Underrepresentation of ESKAPE Pathogens from Developing Regions in 16S rRNA Targeted Sequencing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chouhan, K., Gawande, D., Gupta, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeted 16S rRNA sequencing is stalwart of microbial profiling and diagnostics, but its reliance on some 'universal' primers introduces bias. In this in-silico study, we investigated how well these primers capture ESKAPE pathogens by screening multiple databases and found that a considerable fraction showed suboptimal primer binding, suggesting that amplification and identification may be compromised. Notably, these strains were disproportionately associated with isolates from developing countries, underscoring the risk of primer bias in global surveillance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimization of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system for high-yield protein production in Cupriavidus necator H16</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vajente, M., Ballerstedt, H., +1 author, Schmidt, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many chemical manufacturing routes are being replaced with enzymatic processes to improve sustainability and reduce the use of harmful chemicals. Enzyme production is often the main bottleneck of the process, and proteins are frequently produced using the workhorse E. coli BL21(DE3) and its derivatives. However, other bacteria with beneficial characteristics can also be engineered for this purpose. Cupriavidus necator H16 (C. necator), for example, is a Gram-negative bacterium well-known for its lithoautotrophic metabolism and high polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation. Previous studies have demonstrated high-yield protein production without inclusion body formation, which is one of the main challenges when producing enzymes in E. coli. Nevertheless, high-yield protein production in C. necator remains an understudied field. Here, we optimized a T7 RNA polymerase genetic system to improve protein production in C. necator. We investigated the impact of codon usage, different inducible promoters, and several genetic elements by expressing the fluorescent reporter protein GFP. Codon usage was the main factor limiting protein production in C. necator. Tuning the RBS strength also strongly reduced leakiness of the promoter. As an application, we compared the performance of our engineered C. necator T7 RNA polymerase-based system to that of an E. coli-based T7 system using the ene-reductase YqjM from Bacillus subtilis. The optimized protein expression system in C. necator outperformed the gold standard, E. coli BL21(DE3), in producing soluble, FMN-loaded enzyme. This result highlights the potential of non-model bacteria to achieve high-yield enzyme production and promote the transition to biocatalysis-driven chemical synthesis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BioPrediction-PPI: Simplifying the Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions through Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Florentino, B. R., Bonidia, R. P., +1 author, Carlos Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins are essential in biological processes, primarily through their interactions with other molecules, including proteins. These interactions are crucial for cellular functions and maintaining life. Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) is very important, although challenging, for understanding cellular functions and diseases. This paper presents BioPrediction-PPI, a new end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) framework for PPI prediction, automating the entire process from feature extraction to interpretability, with no manual intervention required. BioPrediction-PPI stands as one of the few end-to-end models that do not rely on deep learning, enabling the automated use of trained models on new data. It offers interpretability graphs for creating auditable models and has been evaluated through comparative experiments with 30 previous studies, using 15 datasets. Additionally, the interpretability graphs provide useful insights for model evaluation and experimental design, supporting informed decision-making. BioPrediction-PPI demonstrates competitive performance across multiple datasets, even without the use of deep learning, and is a transparent, white-box model that can be easily used by biologists and practitioners without a background in computer science. The proposed framework has the potential to accelerate research in biology and related fields by making AI-driven tools more accessible.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Minute-scale single-cell transcriptomics enables dynamic modeling of cellular behavior</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Asthana, K., Jambor, A. N., Wang, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dynamic cellular processes such as signaling, fate decisions, and intercellular communication unfold on minute timescales, a regime inaccessible to conventional transcriptomic methods. This temporal gap has fundamentally limited the development of predictive, causal models of cell behavior. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing ChronoSeq, an automated single-cell RNA sequencing platform that achieves genome-wide profiling with a temporal resolution as brief as seven minutes. By integrating automated live-cell sampling with molecular time-barcoding, ChronoSeq captures rapid transcriptional dynamics with high fidelity. Applying ChronoSeq to TNF- stimulated cells, we discovered a rapid, heterogeneity-driven bifurcation in the NF-{kappa}B response that was previously unobservable. We further demonstrate that the high-density temporal data generated by ChronoSeq enables a new class of computational models that dramatically outperform existing methods in inferring the directionality and targets of post-translationally regulated transcription factors. Finally, in a multicellular co-culture, ChronoSeq resolved a paracrine signaling cascade in real time, identifying both the timing and molecular identity of the intercellular relay. By providing a framework to measure dynamics, infer regulation, and model communication at the true pace of biology, ChronoSeq establishes a new foundation for dynamic systems biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Recurrent Breast Cancer Cells Depend on De novo Pyrimidine Biosynthesis to Suppress Ferroptosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">McCutcheon, K. R., Wu, J., +8 authors, Alvarez, J. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Breast cancer recurrence remains a major clinical challenge, often associated with therapy resistance and altered metabolic states. To define metabolic vulnerabilities of recurrent disease, we performed a CRISPR knockout screen targeting 421 metabolic genes in paired primary and recurrent HER2-driven breast cancer cell lines. While both primary and recurrent tumors shared dependencies on core metabolic pathways, recurrent tumors exhibited selective essentiality for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, including Cad, Dhodh, and Ctps. Pharmacologic inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme DHODH with BAY-2402234 selectively impaired the growth of recurrent tumor cells, while primary tumor cells were relatively resistant. BAY treatment robustly inhibited pyrimidine synthesis in all lines, but only recurrent cells underwent iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death. Lipidomic profiling revealed enrichment of polyunsaturated ether phospholipids in recurrent cells, which may predispose them to ferroptosis. A sensitizer CRISPR screen in primary cells further identified nucleotide salvage and lipid metabolic pathways as modifiers of DHODH inhibitor sensitivity. Stable isotope tracing and nutrient depletion experiments showed that primary cells can compensate for DHODH inhibition through nucleotide salvage, whereas recurrent cells exhibit impaired salvage capacity, likely due to reduced expression of Slc28/Slc29 nucleoside transporters. Together, these findings reveal that breast cancer recurrence is associated with increased dependence on de novo pyrimidine synthesis to suppress ferroptosis, highlighting a therapeutically actionable metabolic vulnerability in recurrent disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cell-Based Immunization Combined with Single-Round Cell Panning Enables Discovery of PSMA-Targeting Nanobodies from Phage Display Libraries</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, T., Veldhoven-Zweistra, J., +13 authors, Jenster, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> There is a strong need for nanobodies targeting novel cancer-associated antigens to advance radioligand imaging and antibody-based therapeutics. In this study, we investigated whether non-targeted Llama immunization using tumor cells, combined with non-targeted phage display panning on human cell lines, could yield nanobodies specific to Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA). Nanobody selection using both classical three round PSMA negative-positive panning and single round panning of cell lines positive or negative for PSMA showed clear enrichment for PSMA binders in both strategies. Using shRNA knockdown, flow cytometry, cell-ELISA, immunohistochemistry and structural modeling and docking, we confirmed the PSMA targeting of selected nanobodies. Two distinct epitopes were predicted to be bound by nanobodies PSMANb9 and A7 (JVZ-007), corroborated by epitope competition assays. These findings support the feasibility of non-targeted immunization and panning strategies for isolating clinically relevant cancer nanobodies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating machine learning and molecular dynamics simulation to decipher the molecular network of dioxin-associated liposarcoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang Chenhe, Zhuang Aobo, +8 authors, Li Wengang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dioxin-like pollutants, especially 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, are recognized human carcinogens. Retrospective studies suggest a link between dioxins and soft tissue sarcomas, including liposarcoma, but mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the toxicological effects of dioxins on liposarcoma, identifies key proteins, and proposes potential solutions. We identified dioxin- and liposarcoma-related targets via databases, analyzed overlaps through enrichment and network toxicology, and validated them with phenotypic and clinical data. We built a prediction model using 117 combinations of machine learning algorithms, confirmed the results with molecular docking and simulations, and proposed therapies through drug experiments. TCDD modulates adipocytic malignancy through activation of xenobiotic response pathways, disruption of cellular metabolism, and interactions with cancer-related receptors. AhR partially mediates this toxicological effect, and five key proteins, including CDH3, ADORA2B, MMP14, IP6K2, and HTR2A, are used to predict the development of dioxin-related liposarcoma. The selective HTR2A receptor antagonist ketanserin has the potential to alleviate this toxicological impact. Our study presents an efficient, cost-effective toxicological analysis using network toxicology, offering new insights into dioxin-associated liposarcoma.</p>
