<h2 class="paper-title">Fast and accurate tree of blobs reconstruction under the network multispecies coalescent</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dai, J., Han, Y., Molloy, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene flow between species or populations is an important force in evolution, modeled by the network multispecies coalescent. Phylogenetic network reconstruction under this model is notoriously challenging, with the leading methods scaling to just tens of species. Divide-and-conquer is a promising path forward; however, methods with statistical consistency guarantees require the tree of blobs (TOB), which displays only the tree-like parts of the network, to perform subset decomposition. TOB reconstruction is challenging in its own right, with the leading method TINNiK having time complexity O(n^5 + n^4k), where k is the number of input gene trees and n is the number of species. In prior work, we introduced a new framework for TOB reconstruction that operates by (1) seeking a refinement of the TOB and then (2) contracting edges in it. For step (1), we estimate a tree using TREE-QMC, a fast quartet-based species tree method with time complexity O(n^3k). For step (2), we contract edges based on the same hypothesis tests as TINNiK, which are applicable to subsets of four taxa. On simulated data sets, our method, referred to as TOB-QMC, was faster and more accurate than TINNiK. Here, we provide the theoretical justification for our framework. For step (1), we show that Weighted Quartet Consensus converges to a TOB refinement with high probability, as the number k of gene trees tends to infinity, motivating the use of fast quartet-based methods for species tree estimation such as TREE-QMC or ASTRAL. ASTRAL, in particular, is statistically consistent in this context. For step (2), we show that sampling just O(n) 4-taxon subsets around each edge is sufficient to ensure that false positive edges in a TOB refinement are contracted with high probability, as k tends to infinity. Thus, our framework enables statistically consistent TOB estimation and is fast, with asymptotic runtime dominated by tree reconstruction in step (1).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rewiring protein function through genetically encoded oxidative chemistry</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, H., Pavlic, A., +2 authors, Shapiro, M. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oxidative chemistry underlies many natural signaling pathways but remains largely unexplored as a design strategy for synthetic control of protein function. Here we introduce genetically encoded oxidative modulation as a general mechanism for regulating protein activity in living cells. Using the genetically encodable photosensitizer miniSOG to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), we show that controlled oxidation alters the behavior of diverse proteins. miniSOG-derived ROS increased the fluorescence of the redox reporter HyPerRed and activated redox-sensitive ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1, with TRPA1 displaying the strongest response. The magnitude and kinetics were tunable by illumination parameters, expression ratios, and subcellular localization of miniSOG, with membrane anchoring markedly improving efficiency of activating a membrane receptor. These findings establish genetically encoded oxidative chemistry as a versatile and tunable modality for controlling protein function.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of Therapeutic Gene Targets in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Hybrid Approach Integrating Semidefinite Programming, Boolean Simulation, and Druggability Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">MONTEIRO, S. A., de Carvalho, L. A. V., da Silva, F. A. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a significant clinical challenge due to the absence of well-established molecular targets and resistance to conventional therapies. Identifying synergistic combinations of therapeutic targets requires computational approaches that integrate topological network analysis, experimental validation, and clinical applicability. This work proposes a hybrid methodology that combines Semidefinite Programming (SDP) for identification of critical nodes in gene regulatory networks, Boolean simulation for quantification of perturbation efficacy, and systematic literature validation with focus on druggability and synergy. We constructed a core regulatory network of 13 genes representing key nodes in STAT3, PI3K/AKT, and p53 signaling pathways, which are frequently deregulated in TNBC. We applied three complementary SDP formulations (Max-Cut, Influence Maximization, and Spectral Clustering) to identify candidate targets, followed by stochastic Boolean simulation for calculation of the Therapeutic Index (TI). We integrated a practical applicability scoring system that considers druggability, clinical evidence, specificity, and TNBC validation. Our analysis identified the combination STAT3 + BCL2 as the most promising therapeutic pair, with an applicability score of 0.905 and average druggability of 0.85. This finding is strongly supported by extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that STAT3 directly regulates BCL2 transcription in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate a clear methodological evolution from previous approaches: from 5 genes (Tilli et al., 2016, druggability 0.32) to 3 genes ([9], druggability 0.40) and finally to 2 genes (our work, druggability 0.85), representing a 166% increase in druggability and 60% reduction in complexity. The proposed methodology offers a systematic and reproducible framework for prioritization of therapeutic targets with focus on clinical applicability, contributing to rational development of combination therapies in TNBC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cargo-directed assembly of nonviral nucleocapsid with controlled size</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tajima, K., Sakai, Y., Terasaka, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise packaging of diverse cargo within self-assembling protein cages of defined size and shape is essential for many biotechnological applications, yet cellular expression offers limited control over loading. Here, we developed a system for in vitro cargo-directed reconstitution of a split, laboratory evolved nonviral nucleocapsid (spNC-4). Independently expressed and purified spNC-4 capsid protein subunits were mixed and assembled with cargo molecules in a cooperative manner. As an authentic cargo, mRNA is packaged into a 30 nm-spheric nucleocapsid in vitro, closely matching to spNC-4 expressed in cells. In this system, a diverse range of cargo molecules, including cognate nucleocapsid mRNA, noncognate RNA, RNA complexed with positively supercharged fluorescent protein, and linear double-stranded DNA are encapsulated within the 30 nm-spheric nucleocapsids in vitro. Moreover, the packaging of 30 nm-spherical or rod-shaped DNA origamis as templates induce morphological alterations of the nucleocapsids, resulting in the formation of enlarged 60 nm-spherical structure or rod-shaped structure, respectively. This split-protein, cargo-dependent system provides versatile and programmable control over both composition and architecture of nonviral protein cages, creating a general platform for enzyme nanoreactors, targeted delivery, and vaccine development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hybrid untargeted and targeted RNA sequencing facilitates genotype-phenotype associations at single-cell resolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, J., Maldifassi, M., +4 authors, Robinson, M. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long-read scRNA-seq has enabled simultaneous, unbiased identification of transcriptomic variants and expression profiling. However, it often suffers from limited read coverage, which constrains its ability to link genotype and phenotype at single-cell resolution. To address this, we evaluated multiple single-cell sequencing technologies for cell typing and genotyping: short-read whole-transcriptome amplification (SR-WTA) via Illumina, long-read whole-transcriptome amplification (LR- WTA), and long-read targeted sequencing (LR-Twist) via the Pacific Biosciences platform. Based on these evaluations, we propose a hybrid strategy with an accompanying Snakemake pipeline that integrates SR-WTA with LR-Twist to leverage the strengths of both approaches. SR-WTA provides broad transcriptomic coverage and allows detection of low-RNA-content cell types, while LR-Twist enriches a targeted panel of 50 genes to achieve deeper coverage for calling variants. By linking single-cell genotypic and transcriptomic states, this hybrid strategy enhances the resolution and statistical power to investigate how mutations shape cellular transcriptional programs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Scalable and systematic hierarchical virus taxonomy with vConTACT3</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bolduc, B., Zablocki, O., +5 authors, Sullivan, M. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Viruses are key players in diverse ecosystems, but studying their impacts is technically and taxonomically challenging. Taxonomic complexities derive from undersampling, diverse DNA and RNA genomes with multiple evolutionary origins, and lack of a universal barcode gene. While virus ecogenomics has expanded access to and understanding of the virosphere, available classification tools poorly scale to modern discovery-based datasets, lack taxonomic resolution, and/or are unable to classify novel sequence space. Here we develop, benchmark, and release vConTACT3, a machine learning-based tool that improves scalability and accuracy, adds extensive user-requested features, expands classification to both eukaryote and prokaryote viruses for 4/6 officially recognized realms, and establishes accurate hierarchical taxonomy from genus to order. Application to 48,069 public virus genomes provided new taxonomy assignments for thousands of taxa, revealed support for fewer taxonomic ranks than currently available, and systematically identified taxonomically problematic areas across the virosphere.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep Learning Enables Automated Segmentation and Quantification of Ultrastructure from Transmission Electron Microscopy Images</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zou, A., Tan, W., +8 authors, Zhang, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The widths of kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and podocyte foot processes (FP) are essential ultrastructural markers for assessing kidney function and diagnosing glomerular disease. FP widening reflects podocyte injury, whereas GBM thickening is characteristic of conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and Alport syndrome. Current measurement practices depend on manual tracing and expert review, which are labor intensive, variable between observers, and difficult to reproduce. We present an automated deep learning based framework TEAMKidney for accurate and scalable measurement of GBM and FP widths in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of glomeruli. The framework combines a proposed Glom2Mask model for panoramic segmentation, enabling robust identification of GBM and FP across species, including mouse, rat, and human kidney samples. Segmentation outputs are processed by computational pipelines to extract and quantify GBM and FP widths. The proposed method showed high concordance with expert annotations, substantially reduced measurement time, and improved reproducibility across datasets. This framework supports both experimental research and clinical applications, offering a reproducible and efficient approach to ultrastructural kidney analysis. By reducing dependence on manual measurements, it provides a scalable digital pathology solution with direct relevance to nephrology research, diagnostic practice, and clinical trials.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">phylobar: an R package for multiresolution compositional barplots in omics studies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kuo, M., Le Cao, K.-A., +2 authors, Sankaran, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Summary: Stacked barplots, though widely used in microbiome studies, can obscure important patterns in microbiome data. They omit rare taxa and can mask shifts that emerge at finer taxonomic levels. To address this issue, we introduce phylobar, an R package that interactively links stacked barplots with overview phylogenetic or taxonomic hierarchies. The interface allows users to collapse or expand subtrees, paint color palettes interactively, and search for specific taxa. This allows comparison across taxonomic resolutions that are hidden in static overviews. phylobar works with any omics data with hierarchical organization, including cell type hierarchies, as we demonstrate in a case study of immune cell composition in COVID-19 patients. Availability and Implementation: phylobar is available as an R package on GitHub. It uses the htmlwidgets library to link interactive D3 visualizations with R. The interactive plots can be embedded within R Markdown or Quarto notebooks, and views can be exported as vector graphics files. The package is open source and documented at url{https://mkdiro-O.github.io/phylobar}.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Network-Based Analysis of Human Astrocytes Links Aging to Neurodegenerative and Cardiovascular Diseases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bota, P. M., Picon-Pages, P., +17 authors, Oliva, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Astrocytes are central to brain homeostasis, supporting neuronal metabolism, synaptic activity, and the blood-brain barrier. With aging, these glial cells undergo molecular and functional changes that weaken support functions and promote neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration. Yet the systems-level mechanisms of astrocytic aging remain poorly defined in human models. Because aging also heightens risk for cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, type 2 diabetes, and systemic inflammation, clarifying shared astrocytic pathways is critical for understanding brain-body crosstalk. Using an in vitro human astrocyte model exposed to sublethal oxidative stress (10 M H2O2), we profiled transcriptomic changes and identified differentially expressed genes across antioxidant defences, proteostasis, transcriptional regulation, vesicular trafficking, and inflammatory signalling. We then performed seven network-prioritization analyses on a curated human protein-protein interactome: one seeded with the astrocyte H2O&amp;2-responsive genes and six with phenotype-associated gene sets (Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, type 2 diabetes, oxidative stress, and inflammation). Intersecting the top 5% scoring genes from each run yielded a 127-gene core shared across all seven, enriched for proteostasis, DNA repair, mitochondrial regulation, and telomere and nuclear envelope maintenance. Structure-guided analyses highlighted vulnerable interfaces, including lamin A/C-lamin B1, -actinin-filamins, 14-3-3 dimers, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase assemblies, where pathogenic variants are predicted to destabilize or aberrantly stabilize protein interactions. Structure-based interface predictions also highlight potential interactions between APP-VCP/p97 and p53-14-3-3{zeta} that link proteostasis and stress signalling. Together, these findings define a conserved astrocytic vulnerability network that may couple neurodegeneration with cardiovascular disease and nominate structurally testable targets for biomarkers and interventions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ambient mass spectrometry imaging enables spatial metabolomics of optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT)-embedded tumors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Monaghan, J., Woytowich, N., +4 authors, Duncan, K. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is emerging as a powerful tool for uncovering the distribution of metabolites in the tumor microenvironment and studying tumor metabolism in vivo. However, to date, MSI of primary patient biobanked tissues contextualized by patient data has been limited to peptides, proteins, and glycans - with few examples for metabolites. This is because most biobanked fresh-frozen tissue required for spatial metabolomics is embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), which introduces high-abundance polymeric interferents. Herein, we use nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) to demonstrate the MSI of metabolites in OCT-embedded tissue. Metabolite coverage and sensitivity for prepared tissue mimetic homogenates embedded in OCT and an MSI-compatible material, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), showed excellent agreement. We apply our ambient MSI workflow to detect changes in intratumoral methionine using a preclinical cancer mouse model undergoing adoptive T-cell therapy. Eight days after tumor incubation, lymphoma-bearing mice were maintained on a complete or methionine-restricted diet for 2 days. Nano-DESI MSI revealed a heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, with multiple methionine-cycle intermediates (S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine) and related metabolites, including known T-cell modulators (1-methylnicotinamide, polyamines) localizing to tumor subregions. Methionine-restricted tumors exhibited reduced methionine levels and elevated S-adenosylmethionine, relative to the control group. Overall, this work demonstrates spatial metabolomics on fresh-frozen OCT-embedded tissue, unlocking the wealth of information stored in primary tissue biobanks and consequently accelerating our understanding of cancer metabolism and treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Iron addicted colorectal cancers exploit Heme-Complex II axis to resist oxidative cell death</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jain, C., Essani, M., +19 authors, Shah, Y. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells are addicted to iron, which fuels nucleotide synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, and rapid proliferation. Yet paradoxically, high intracellular iron is cytotoxic to most other cells, raising the question of how CRC cells tolerate and exploit iron-rich environments. One pathway thought to mediate iron toxicity is ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. However, most ferroptosis regulators were identified through synthetic chemical screens or small molecule activators, and it remains unclear whether these canonical pathways explain how iron itself triggers cell death, particularly in vivo. Here, using multi-omics profiling, CRISPR screening, and in vivo models, we uncover a heme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) Coenzyme Q (CoQ) axis that enables CRC cells to buffer iron-induced oxidative stress. Heme-dependent SDH reduces CoQ, which redistributes to mitochondrial and plasma membranes to detoxify lipid ROS as a radical trapping antioxidant. This pathway functions alongside, and in some contexts independently of, canonical ferroptosis regulators. These findings reveal that CRCs co-opt metabolic cofactors not only for growth but also for survival under physiologically toxic iron levels, uncovering new vulnerabilities for therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrated Proteomic and Epigenomic Analysis Reveals IGF2 as a Vulnerability in PRC2-Deficient Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lempiainen, J. K., Miachin, K., +9 authors, Garcia, B. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas with limited therapeutic options. Loss of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), via inactivating mutations in SUZ12 or EED, occurs frequently in MPNSTs and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the downstream chromatin and signaling consequences of these mutations remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that PRC2 deficiency in MPNST cells induces coordinated chromatin remodeling, characterized by loss of repressive H3K27me3 and gain of activating marks, including H3K27ac and H3K36me2. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling revealed that this chromatin reprogramming activates a fetal-like growth signature centered on insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and its post-transcriptional regulators, Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 mRNA-Binding Protein (IGF2BP1-3). Functional studies demonstrate that PRC2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on IGF2 for proliferation, and that restoration of SUZ12 suppresses IGF2 expression and reduces growth. Analysis of human MPNST tumors confirms upregulation of the IGF2-IGF2BP axis in PRC2-deficient tumors, highlighting its clinical relevance. Together, these findings link PRC2 loss to activation of fetal growth factor-driven oncogenic signaling and identify IGF2 and its regulatory network as potential vulnerabilities in this aggressive tumor subtype.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Venkataramani, P., Elkayam, E., +11 authors, Tonks, N. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is crucial for normal brain development and its disruption has been linked to various cancers. DYRK1A drives glioblastoma (GBM) progression via stabilization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we describe two, selective, benzothiazole-derived DYRK inhibitors, FC-2 and FC-3, obtained by structure-activity optimization of a natural product lead. Both compounds inhibit DYRK1A with nanomolar potency and display high selectivity across a kinase panel. The co-crystal structure of FC-3 with DYRK1A revealed ATP-competitive binding, with interactions at the hinge region and the DYRK-specific phenylalanine gatekeeper residue explaining target selectivity. Generation of inhibitor-resistant mutants confirmed DYRK1A as the primary cellular target. In GBM cell-models, FC-2 and FC-3 impaired neurosphere self-renewal, cell invasion, and EGFR stability, phenocopying DYRK1A loss. Both compounds crossed the blood-brain barrier and suppressed tumor growth, to prolong survival in intracranial xenografts. These findings identify FC-2 and FC-3 as selective small-molecule inhibitors of DYRK1A with potential therapeutic utility in GBM.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Efferocytosis-related signatures identified via Single-cell analysis and machine learning predict TNBC outcomes and immunotherapy response.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lan Wei, Siyang Wen, +13 authors, Yan Zhang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis and limited targeted treatment options. Efferocytosis, an essential immune mechanism for the clearance of apoptotic cells, is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to tumor immune evasion. This study aimed to identify key efferocytosis-related genes in TNBC, investigate their impact on the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy responses, and construct a prognostic model to inform and optimize treatment strategies. RNA sequencing data and clinical information for patients with TNBC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Machine learning models were employed to derive efferocytosis-related signatures to predict clinical outcomes and immunotherapy responses. Eight efferocytosis-related genes were identified, considered efferocytosis-related gene signatures herein: P2RX1, IFNG, IL1A, CD93, XKR8, SIAH2, F2RL1, and TLR4. Using the individual risk scores derived from this model, patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, revealing significant differences in immune infiltration and immuno-therapy response. Our study highlights the predictive significance of efferocytosis in assessing chemotherapy sensitivity, emphasizing the pivotal role of the immune microenvironment in mediating drug resistance. Moreover, we identified potential targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TXSelect: A multi-task learning model to identify secretory effectors.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jing Li, Qing Liu, +1 author, Chao Zhan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Secretory effectors from pathogenic microorganisms significantly influence pathogen survival and pathogenicity by manipulating host signalling, immune responses, and metabolic processes. However, because of sequence and structural heterogeneity among bacterial effectors, accurately classifying multiple types simultaneously remains challenging. Therefore, we developed TXSelect, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously classifies TXSE (types I, II, III, IV and VI secretory effectors) using a shared backbone network with task-specific heads. TXSelect integrates the protein embedding features of evolutionary scale modelling (ESM), particularly the N-terminal mean, with classical descriptors to effectively capture complementary information. These descriptors include distance-based residue (DR) and split amino acid composition general (SC-PseAAC-General). Rigorous evaluation identified ESM N-terminal mean + DR + SC-PseAAC as the optimal feature combination, achieving high accuracy (validation F1 = 0.867, test F1 = 0.8645) and robust generalization. Comprehensive assessments and visualization with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection further validated the discriminative capability and interpretability of the model. TXSelect provides an efficient computational tool for accurately classifying bacterial effectors, supporting deeper biological understanding and potential therapeutic development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Asymmetric Dynamics Between the Protomers of the σ2 Receptor Homodimer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu M, Alyemni S, +6 authors, Haider S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The sigma-2 receptor (σ2R/TMEM97) is a clinically relevant membrane protein involved in cholesterol regulation and overexpressed in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its therapeutic potential, the dynamic mechanisms underlying σ2R function and ligand binding remain poorly understood. Here, we combined adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations with quasi-anharmonic analysis and unsupervised machine learning method to investigate the conformational behavior of the σ2R homodimer in both apo and cholesterol-bound states. Our results reveal asymmetric dynamics between the two protomers. This asymmetry is driven by anticorrelated helical motions and mutually exclusive salt bridge formation, including a switching mechanism between K55-E139 and D122-R140. Cholesterol binding further enhances this asymmetry by stabilizing one protomer and altering the dynamics of the other. Species-specific allosteric interaction between D56-R133 may be essential for the human σ2R function. Additional lipid-protein interaction analysis highlights asymmetric membrane coupling in the bound state. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the receptor's dimeric nature, suggesting that ligand binding at one site may allosterically influence the apo protomer, thereby modulating receptor function. Our work provides new mechanistic insight into σ2R function and highlights the importance of asymmetric dynamics.</p>
