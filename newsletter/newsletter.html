<h2 class="paper-title">Engineered orthogonal translation systems from metagenomic libraries expand the genetic code</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seki, K., Nguyen, M. T. A., +3 authors, Jewett, M. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genetic code expansion with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) opens new opportunities for the function and design of proteins by broadening their chemical repertoire. Unfortunately, ncAA incorporation is limited both by a small collection of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and tRNAs and by low-throughput methods to discover them. Here, we report the discovery, characterization, and engineering of a UGA suppressing orthogonal translation system mined from metagenomic data. We developed an integrated computational and experimental pipeline to profile the orthogonality of &gt;200 tRNAs, test &gt;1,250 combinations of aaRS:tRNA pairs, and identify the AP1 TrpRS:tRNATrp UCA as an orthogonal pair that natively encodes tryptophan at the UGA codon. We demonstrate that the AP1 TrpRS:tRNATrpUCA is highly active in cell-free and cellular contexts. We then use Ochre, a genomically recoded Escherichia coli strain that lacks UAG and UGA codons, to engineer an AP1 TrpRS variant capable of 5-hydroxytryptophan incorporation at an open UGA codon. We anticipate that our strategy of integrating metagenomic bioprospecting with cell-free screening and cell-based engineering will accelerate the discovery and optimization of orthogonal translation systems for genetic code expansion.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A comprehensive genetic toolkit for Zymomonas mobilis; allowing rapid, high-resolution, combinatorial engineering of metabolic pathways.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Poma, M., Marchetti, M., +6 authors, Kelly, C. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The lack of robust genetic tools has hindered the precise engineering of Zymomonas mobilis, a key organism for the bioproduction of many commodity chemicals. Here, we developed a library of synthetic promoters with a wide range of expression, not described in Z. mobilis to date, strong transcriptional terminators to enable fine transcriptional control, and bicistronic designs (BCDs) for predictable translation across diverse genetic contexts. Promoter activity in Z. mobilis was shown to be unaffected by oxygen availability, indicating stable performance under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The characterised molecular tools were made compatible with Start-Stop assembly, a high-throughput combinatorial assembly method, and their functionality demonstrated with the rapid construction of a library of plasmids expressing a 2,3-butanediol biosynthetic pathway. Together, these molecular tools lay the foundation for the high-resolution and predictable engineering of multi-enzyme pathways in Z. mobilis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Assessing the Performance of LLMs in Multimodal Information Extraction for Biological Research: A Case Study on LLPS</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chin, K. Y., Fujii, S., +1 author, Terayama, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in experimental techniques have expanded the volume of biological data. This has increased the demand for structured information extraction from papers, with large language models (LLMs) considered promising. However, challenges remain, including limited validation in biology and unclear applicability to multimodal tasks that integrate text with domain-specific figures, such as microscopic images and scatter plots. Here, we developed a multimodal LLM (MLLM)-based workflow to extract the experimental conditions and phase status from the text and figures of experimental papers on liquid-liquid phase separation and validated the effect of various inputs, prompts, and MLLM types. As a result, the Gemini 2.5 Pro-based extraction achieved an F1-score of 0.847 by processing each figure as a processing unit and inputting domain-specific prompts reflecting manual extraction guidance. This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of MLLMs for extracting biological information and provides insights for advancing multimodal approaches in biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unmixing of Imaging Mass Spectrometry Measurements Using Microscopy-Informed Constraints</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Moens, R. A. R., Patterson, N. H., +4 authors, Van de Plas, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) provides spatially resolved molecular information of organic tissue but can be limited by pixel signals mixing contributions from adjacent biological structures, e.g. of single cells and multicellular functional tissue units (FTUs). This paper proposes computational methods to predict mass spectral profiles of biological structures on the basis of IMS data by unmixing pixel-level signals, leveraging microscopy-based boundary information of these structures. By modeling each biological structure as having a unique mass spectrum, we formulate a linear mixing model and solve the corresponding inverse problem that unmixes blended signals. In particular, we cover both overdetermined and underdetermined linear system scenarios and compare ordinary least squares, non-negative least squares, and singular value thresholding to a custom algorithm, coined Tissue-informed Unmixing of Labeled regions by Inverse Problem (TULIP), specifically tailored to IMS data. Validation on a synthetic in-situ single cell dataset and demonstration on a large-scale kidney FTU dataset illustrate the potential of these methods for enhanced in-situ tissue structure analysis, e.g. in cellular and tissue studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Borman, T., Benedetti, G., +18 authors, Lahti, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The expansion of microbiome research has led to the accumulation of interlinked datasets encompassing versatile taxonomic and functional assays. While critical to advance the field, the analysis of increasingly large and heterogeneous multi-modal microbiome data would benefit from unified approaches supporting the design of modular data science workflows through interoperable methods. The Bioconductor project has recently developed an optimized statistical programming framework for multi-assay data integration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a community-developed open source ecosystem for microbiome data science. In contrast to the previous alternatives, the methodology is specifically designed to support joint analysis of hierarchical, interlinked, and heterogeneous multi-table datasets that are increasingly common in modern microbiome research. This data science ecosystem encompasses open data, methods, tutorials, and an active online community. These resources support standardized and reproducible data wrangling, joint analysis, and reporting. We have detailed the unctionality and usage in the online book (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel), which offers guidance for prospective users and contributors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Accurately modelling RNase H-mediated antisense oligonucleotide efficacy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hill, B., Jaques, M. R., +6 authors, Rinaldi, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a powerful class of drugs with the potential to treat a wide range of human diseases. However, the prediction of ASO efficacy remains challenging, as large-scale and costly experimental screens are typically required to identify optimal candidates for a specific therapeutic target. To address this challenge, we compiled ASO Atlas, a database comprising 188,521 RNase H-mediated ASO sequences targeting 334 unique genes with corresponding knockdown efficacy measurements extracted from published patents. Using ASO Atlas, we trained OligoAI, a deep learning model capable of jointly modelling RNA target context, ASO sequence, sugar and backbone chemistries, and dosage to predict in vitro efficacy. We experimentally validated OligoAI by targeting KCNT2, achieving a 5.72-fold reduction in screening effort compared to random selection. ASO Atlas provides the first systematic resource to rigorously evaluate hypotheses regarding key parameters in ASO design, including sequence composition, chemical modifications, and target region selection. Both ASO Atlas and OligoAI have been made freely accessible through an online web-tool with the aim of facilitating the accelerated optimisation of ASO design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A gene program dictionary of human cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, Y., Wang, Y., +2 authors, Ma, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Defining all human cell types and their roles in health and disease is a central goal of biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the construction of organ-specific cell atlases, but building a comprehensive organism-wide atlas spanning multiple organs remains challenging due to batch effects, study biases, and inter-organ complexity. Here, we present Gene Program Dictionary (GPD), a framework that leverages robust gene co-expression programs-rather than direct cell integration-to overcome these barriers. Using SpacGPA, a partial correlation-based network method, we analyzed 466 scRNA-seq datasets, generating 1,975 independent networks and 90,701 gene co-expression modules, which were consolidated into 1,534 consensus gene programs representing a wide range of human tissues and cell types. Each program serves as a composite marker, capturing both cell-type-specific and shared biological processes. We demonstrate their utility by mapping endothelial cell subtypes across tissues to reveal their heterogeneity-including tumor-specific programs-annotating colorectal cancer spatial transcriptomes, and linking programs and their corresponding cell types to disease loci, revealing hotspots such as neuronal programs in psychiatric disorders and a proximal tubule program in kidney diseases. GPD provides an organism-wide reference for studying cellular diversity and disease mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Structure-based Predictions of Conformational B Cell Epitopes by Protein Language Model and Deep Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Y., Vilicich, F., +4 authors, Wu, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mapping conformational B-cell epitopes remains a central challenge for antibody discovery: experiments are costly and most computational tools trained on generic protein-protein interfaces transfer poorly to -antibody-antigen recognition. We introduce a patch-centric framework that predicts epitopes directly on antigen structures. Each surface "patch" is defined as a triad of neighboring residues, capturing the smallest local unit that encodes both shape and chemistry. We evaluate two classifiers: (i) a protein language model (PLM) approach that averages ESM-2 embeddings over each triad and scores them with a small multilayer perceptron, and (ii) a convolutional baseline that consumes a hand-crafted 15x20 feature matrix summarizing amino-acid identity, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and shape index. Trained with five-fold cross-validation on 1,151 AbDb antibody-antigen complexes, the PLM model markedly outperforms the CNN at the patch level (e.g., F1{approx}0.986, ROC-AUC{approx}0.998). Aggregating patch scores to residues with an ensemble over all folds yields robust residue-wise performance, surpassing the CNN (ROC-AUC 0.689{+/-}0.072 vs. 0.548{+/-}0.018). Against widely used sequence- and structure-based tools on AbDb, our PLM achieves the best summary metrics (ROC-AUC 0.67, PR-AUC 0.56) with full coverage of all antigens. On five external complexes unseen during development, the model generalizes well (ROC-AUC 0.663) and accurately localizes binding regions qualitatively. The method converts PLM representations into interpretable epitope likelihood maps, offering a practical aid for antigen prioritization, antibody engineering, and vaccine design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RAWtunda: a Tool to Convert a Multi-Channel Raw Image into TIFF and OME-TIFF Formats</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dworak, N. M., Cooper, M. R., Fox, J. W., de Oliveira, A. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: High-resolution biological imaging in spatial biology produces data in many proprietary formats. The lack of compatibility between these formats restricts reproducibility and analysis, creates access issues, and makes early data analysis a challenge. Results: Here, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to convert proprietary image formats into standardized formats like OME-TIFF and TIFF, which we have termed Rawtunda. This tool addresses the need for easy and efficient handling of large, complex imaging data generated in spatial biology and microscopy, facilitating data sharing, analysis, and long-term storage. Featuring an intuitive interface the application supports users in converting .mcd and .ndpi formats, generated from Image Mass Cytometry (IMC) and Digital Pathology scanners, respectively. This resource aims to improve the interoperability of spatial biology datasets, streamline data management workflows, and promote reproducibility in imaging research and analysis while preserving crucial image metadata. The app ensures compatibility with downstream tools and is designed for both bioinformaticians and bench biologists without experience in coding. Availability and implementation: The software, the documentation, and examples are available as open-source a https://med.virginia.edu/spatial-biology-core/rawtunda/ under the Copywrite of University of Virginia.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Characterization of Cancer-Reactive T Cells and Neoantigen-specific T Cell Receptors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sun, W., Liu, S., +3 authors, Bleakley, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Not all tumor-infiltrating T cells are cancer-reactive (CR). Several studies have reported gene expression signatures associated with CR-T cells. To integrate these findings, we developed a computational workflow, CAT (Cancer-Associated T cells), which harmonizes existing CR-T cell signatures and applies them to identify CR-T cells across an atlas of one million T cells. Our findings reveal that the abundance of CR-T cells varies across cancer types and that baseline levels of CR-T cells predict patients' responses to immunotherapy. In parallel, we established a high-throughput computational platform, Neo-TCR, for systematic screening of neoantigen-specific TCRs and their cognate neoantigens. The efficacy of Neo-TCR is validated by cross-validation studies and replications in two independent datasets. Together, our findings suggest a new direction for developing biomarkers for cancer detection and monitoring: integrating CR gene expression signatures with neoantigen-specific TCRs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Glioblastoma-natural killer cell crosstalk: insights from dynamic spheroid models reveal the importance of secreted cytokines and the CD155 axis</h2>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive primary brain cancer with poor patient prognosis. Natural killer (NK) cells can recognise and eliminate a range of malignant cells, including GB stem cells, which drive GB recurrence. NK cell-based immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for GB treatment, but a better understanding of the complex crosstalk between GB and NK cells is needed, particularly within the immunosuppressive GB tumour microenvironment. In this study, we established a reproducible protocol for the production and dynamic culture of uniformly sized GB spheroids using the Celvivo Clinostar system. Our spheroids recapitulated the heterogeneous structure of GB and expressed ligands for NK cell receptors at levels distinct from those observed in corresponding GB cell lines in standard culture, implicating altered sensitivity of GB cells to NK cells in dynamic 3D cultures. GB-NK cell crosstalk was GB cell type dependent and the ability of NK cells to infiltrate GB did not necessarily correlate with their cytotoxicity against GB cells. Spheroids derived from differentiated GB cells secreted higher levels of immunomodulatory cytokines compared to spheroids from GB stem-like cells, and a prominent increase in the secretion of immune-attracting factors was observed in their co-cultures with NK cells. Finally, the CD155-DNAM1/TIGIT axis was indicated as an important regulator of NK cell cytotoxicity against GB stem-like cells. Collectively, our results highlight important factors in GB-NK cell communication and provide a groundwork for further targeted research as well as therapeutic evaluation of NK cell-based approaches in the established dynamic 3D cultures.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Robust Immunohistochemistry-Based Classification for BRAF V600E-Mutant Colorectal Cancer With Clinical Implications.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu C, Ruan Y, +9 authors, Zhang Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a distinct molecular subtype with considerable heterogeneity in tumor biology and therapeutic response. Although gene expression-based classifications (BM1/BM2 subtypes) provide valuable insights into underlying molecular and immune features, their clinical application is limited by the need for high-throughput sequencing. This study aims to establish an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based classification system to enable practical subtype stratification and aid prognostic and therapeutic evaluation. Using two independent cohorts (public dataset, n = 218; institutional cohort, n = 122), we performed differential expression analysis, machine learning modeling, and clinical feasibility evaluation. Fourteen candidate markers were identified, and a decision tree algorithm selected CD8 and ARHGEF17 as optimal classifiers. Based on these markers, two IHC-based subtypes were established: iBM1 (CD8+/ARHGEF17-) and iBM2 (CD8- with any ARHGEF17 expression or CD8+/ARHGEF17+). The IHC-based subtypes showed concordance with transcriptomic BM subtypes (training: 82.69%, κ = 0.55; validation: 72.22%, κ = 0.44; prospective: 83.33%, κ = 0.57). Transcriptomic profiling revealed enrichment of immune activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in iBM1, and cell cycle-related pathways in iBM2. In clinical validation, iBM1 was associated with poorer survival but greater sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This IHC-based classification provides a practical and accessible approach for BM subtype stratification, reflecting underlying molecular and immune characteristics, and may support prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision-making in BRAF V600E-mutant CRC.</p>
