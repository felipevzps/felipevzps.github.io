<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting the pathway involvement of metabolites annotated in the MetaCyc knowledgebase.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Erik D Huckvale, Hunter N B Moseley</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The associations of metabolites with biochemical pathways are highly useful information for interpreting molecular datasets generated in biological and biomedical research. However, such pathway annotations are sparse in most molecular datasets, limiting their utility for pathway level interpretation. To address these shortcomings, several past publications have presented machine learning models for predicting the pathway association of small biomolecule (metabolite and xenobiotic) using data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). But other similar knowledgebases exist, for example MetaCyc, which has more compound entries and pathway definitions than KEGG.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">De novo design of metalloproteases for targeted amyloid-β cleavage</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qu, Y., Wang, C., +2 authors, Cao, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> De novo protein design has not yet achieved the creation of proteases capable of selectively cleaving any desired peptide bond within a native protein with high precision. Here, we report the use of the flow-based generative model Proteus2 to design metalloproteases by generating enzyme-substrate complexes conditioned on a target sequence and a predefined catalytic motif. Our approach employs a two-step encapsulation strategy to create clamp-like metalloproteases that bind the target peptide in a manner that maximizes substrate sequence specificity. This generative process simultaneously optimizes the precise positioning of the target peptide bond in a catalytically competent configuration and accurately scaffolds the transition state catalytic residues-both essential for specific and efficient catalysis. Using this strategy, we designed zinc metalloproteases targeting three distinct cleavage sites within the aggregation-prone regions of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), a key pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease. Experimental characterization validated five enzymes, each capable of precise cleavage at the intended sites with high specificity and minimal or undetectable activity on non-cognate substrates. On average, these enzymes accelerated peptide bond hydrolysis by more than 107-fold relative to the uncatalyzed reaction. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of sequence-guided, generative approaches for developing programmable, sequence-specific proteolysis and lay the groundwork for future applications in basic research and therapeutic development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhanced tRNA array method version 2 for simultaneous in vitro synthesis of 21 tRNAs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Miyachi, R., Ichihashi, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play an essential role in translation, and their simultaneous in vitro synthesis remains a key challenge in bottom-up synthetic biology. We previously developed the tRNA array method that enables the simultaneous in vitro synthesis of 21 tRNAs from a single DNA template; however, the translational activity was substantially lower than that achieved using individually prepared 21 tRNAs for some proteins. Here, we identify the tRNA groups (PIEN group) that limit translation in the tRNA array method and improve the translational activities by stabilizing their cloverleaf structures through sequence design and redesigning the array arrangement. The resulting tRNA array method version 2 produces a tRNA set that allows translation at levels similar to those achieved with individually prepared tRNAs for multiple reporter proteins under both translation-coupled and uncoupled conditions. This tRNA synthesis scheme provides an improved platform for constructing self-reproducible gene expression systems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Can AI Conduct Autonomous Scientific Research? Case Studies on Two Real-World Tasks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Agrawal, S., Anadkat, H., +9 authors, Sinitskiy, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted claims about autonomous "AI scientists," yet systematic evaluations of these capabilities remain scarce. This exploratory study investigates whether current AI frameworks can execute scientific research tasks beyond isolated demonstrations. We tested eight open-source AI frameworks (Agent Laboratory, AutoGen, BabyAGI, GPT Researcher, MOOSE-Chem2, SciAgents, SciMON, and Virtual Lab) on two tasks that aimed to reproduce research on algorithm development from recent papers in uncertainty quantification and protein interaction discovery. In our evaluation, no framework completed a full research cycle from literature understanding through computational execution to validated results and scientific paper writing. While all systems showed competence in conceptual tasks such as planning and summarization, they consistently failed at robust implementation. Every framework produced sophisticated hallucinations. Deployment proved demanding, requiring substantial debugging and technical expertise, which undermines common claims about the democratization of science with AI. Despite these limitations, the frameworks showed promise as research assistants for methodological planning and ideation under careful human supervision. Our findings suggest that the explored AI systems cannot yet autonomously conduct scientific research, but may provide real value for specific subtasks within the research workflow. We offer preliminary observations to help researchers and developers better understand the gap between advertised and actual capabilities of AI in science.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CD99Targeted Irinotecan Containing Nanoparticles Show Twenty-Fold Greater Anti-Tumor Effect Than Free Irinotecan For Treatment of EwingSarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kang, H. G., Mitra, S., +4 authors, Triche, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: To assess the antitumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of NV103, a CD99 targeted liposomal irinotecan nanoparticle, in a preclinical Ewing sarcoma model. Experimental Design: NV103 is a CD99 antibody targeted irinotecan containing nanoparticle, engineered to selectively deliver irinotecan to CD99 expressing tumor cells. In vitro studies measured binding, internalization, and cytotoxic IC50 values in several Ewing sarcoma cell lines. In vivo, mice bearing xenografts derived from treatment naive and chemoresistant Ewing lines were treated. NV103 was compared with free irinotecan, untargeted nanoparticles, and Onivyde at multiple dosages. Plasma pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and SN38, biodistribution of the nanoparticles, and toxicity (body weight, organ function, and hematology) were assessed. Results: NV103 bound selectively to tumor cells (&gt;80 fold over control), was rapidly internalized, and showed enhanced potency in vitro (IC50 = 3 to 4 nM at 0.5 to 1 h). In vivo, biweekly dosing at 5 mg/kg resulted in full tumor regression sustained for 140 days, even after stopping treatment at day 70. Effective suppression and survival benefit were observed at doses as low as 1 mg/kg; the ED50 was estimated to be between 1 and 2.5 mg/kg versus 50mg/kg for free irinotecan. In a chemoresistant Ewing tumor cell line, NV103 induced similar tumor free remission. Pharmacokinetics revealed prolonged and elevated plasma levels of irinotecan with NV103 versus free drug. No systemic toxicity was detected at doses of 10 mg/kg. Biodistribution showed tumor-preferential accumulation. Conclusions: NV103 displays potent and durable antitumor activity in Ewing sarcoma at low doses with no toxicity and favorable pharmacokinetics. These findings support further development for clinical translation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Circulating immune profiling reveals impaired monocyte states and trajectories driving immunosuppression in glioblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Scafidi, A., Kaoma, T., +17 authors, Michelucci, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal brain tumor marked by profound local and systemic immune dysfunction. Yet, the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of peripheral impairments remains undefined. To clinically dissect their underlying mechanisms and pathological implications, we combined mass and flow cytometry with single-cell RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from GBM patients and healthy donors. GBM blood profiles were characterized by heterogeneous changes in classical monocytes, encompassing expanded, reduced and unchanged subsets, presenting distinct functional states, including antigen-presenting, interferon and metabolic subsets. Additional adaptations included myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion and loss of non-classical monocytes. Trajectory analyses positioned MDSCs as an intermediate state, in continuum with the metabolic subset. Single-cell RNA-sequencing further showed antigen-presenting monocyte propensity to differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages. Circulating monocytes shared a GBM-classical monocytic signature exhibiting low MHC class II expression, altered cell-cell communication and increased anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL1R2 and CD163. Lastly, lymphocyte alterations included decreased proportions of CD4+ T, natural killer (NK) and CD56+ T cells, retaining relatively conserved activation profiles, exemplified by up-regulation of alarmins S100A8/S100A9. These findings map systemic immune reprogramming in GBM, suggesting new avenues for non-invasive biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies to restore anti-tumor immunity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cellular consequences, citrullination substrates, and antigenicity resulting from wild-type and targeted PAD4 on cell surfaces</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kong, S., Peters-Clarke, T. M., +3 authors, Wells, J. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4) catalyzes hydrolysis of arginine to citrulline in proteins that promotes widespread changes in cellular phenotypes through transcriptional regulation that can induce innate immunity and promote cancer. Overexpression and hyperactivity of PAD4 leads to a form of cell death called NETosis that releases PAD4 to the extracellular space. In excess, release of PAD4 is believed to be a major cause of various autoimmune diseases through the generation of anti-citrulline protein antibodies (ACPAs). Little is known about the specific protein substrates that become citrullinated and lead to autoimmunity, but there is growing evidence that PAD4 can be localized to the cell surface in response to inflammation. Here, we further characterize the cellular consequences for exogenous treatment with PAD4 showing that it induces morphological changes that increase cell migration, a hallmark of cancer. We then devised a more simplified and robust proteomics approach to identify PAD4 substrates. We identified some 1000 endogenously citrullinated peptides from 500 proteins, and 3000 citrullinated peptides from 1300 proteins upon exogenous addition of PAD4 both inside and outside of cells. This extracellular set can be further augmented by targeting PAD4 to a cancer target, HER2, using a binding protein conjugate. Finally, we studied how citrullinated cells can induce a robust humoral response in a syngeneic vaccine model to produce ACPAs. We believe these studies further our understanding of cell phenotypic consequences of extracellular PAD4 and new PAD4 substrates both inside and outside of cells that are potential neoepitopes for generation of ACPAs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Impacts of mutation accumulation and order on tumor initiation revealed by engineered murine colorectal cancer organoids</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Y., Xie, X., +6 authors, Zhu, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumorigenesis typically follows a multi-hit trajectory, driven by accumulating oncogenic mutations. Colorectal cancer (CRC) has long served as a paradigmatic model of multi-hit tumorigenesis, characterized by adenoma-carcinoma transition accompanied by acquisition of specific oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations. However, how the temporal order of early mutations influences CRC initiation remains poorly understood. To address this, we established a CRC tumorigenesis model using murine intestinal organoids. By introducing defined combinations of key CRC driver mutations (Kras, Apc, and Trp53) in distinct orders, we systematically investigated how the order of mutation accumulation affects tumor initiation. Our results reveal that the mutation accumulation confers growth advantages in both in vitro and in vivo models. Strikingly, mutation order also influenced the tumorigenic properties of the organoids. Whereas organoids with Trp53 loss before or after Apc loss similarly affected organoid phenotypes in vitro or tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice, organoids with Trp53 loss preceding Apc inactivation exhibited reduced tumor-forming potential in immunocompetent mice, likely due to their distinct immunological features. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role of ordered mutation accumulation in CRC initiation, an insight that may hold clinical relevance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProxiCapture Reveals Context-Dependent CRBN Interactore Landscape of Molecular Glue Degraders</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kazi, R., Bailey, H. J., +7 authors, Dikic, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular glue degraders represent a rapidly expanding class of small molecules that reprogram E3 ubiquitin ligases to ubiquitinate and degrade disease-relevant proteins. Despite their therapeutic potential, the rational design of molecular glues remains challenging, underscoring the need for unbiased discovery strategies to identify new chemical targets. To address this challenge, we developed ProxiCapture, an affinity-based proteomics workflow that models the systemic behavior of molecular glues by combining purified CRBN-{Delta}HBD protein with native cell or tissue lysates. Systematic application of ProxiCapture across eight cancer cell lines, three maturation states of immune cells, and paired primary healthy and tumor tissues, revealed a comprehensive atlas of pomalidomide interactors, including previously uncharacterized targets. These findings reveal that degrader-dependent interactors of CRBN are context-dependent, requiring broad, physiologically and systemically anchored sampling to uncover the full glueable proteome. Taken together, this study establishes a scalable platform that accelerates molecular glue discovery by capturing cell- and tissue-specific recruitment profiles and predicting system-wide degrader effects.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Drug-tolerant persister cells reallocate carbon sources to fuel antioxidant metabolism for survival</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, M., Priem, B., +3 authors, Amend, S. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Therapy resistance is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) represent a major barrier to cancer cure, mediating resistance through adaptive cell state transitions and driving tumor progression. Here, we investigate metabolic differences between DTPs and drug-sensitive cancer cells using integrated fluxomics. Proteomic profiling and extracellular flux analyses revealed that DTPs upregulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis while reducing oxidative phosphorylation, indicating a shift in central carbon metabolism. Isotope tracing and metabolic modeling demonstrate that DTPs utilize glucose to fuel the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate NADPH and metabolize glutamine to provide carbons for the PPP via gluconeogenesis. Integrating our multi-omic datasets into a genome-scale model identified that DTPs sustain antioxidant metabolism by decreasing fluxes of other NADPH-consuming reactions upon in silico PPP knockout. These findings reveal a systems-level shift in DTP metabolism that maintains antioxidant activity for cell survival, highlighting potential new targets and treatment paradigms to overcome therapy resistance.</p>
