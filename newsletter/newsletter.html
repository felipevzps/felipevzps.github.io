<h2 class="paper-title">PyMOL plugin for Protein Circuit Topology</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dimins, M., Bazba, A., +6 authors, Mashaghi, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circuit Topology (CT) is a fundamental property of folded polymer chains and provides a unique and powerful topological framework for protein analysis, with applications in functional annotation, disease marker identification, protein engineering, and drug development. An open-source Python-based implementation of CT, called ProteinCT, provides access to circuit topology analysis through a scripting environment. Here, we present the ProteinCT tool as a plugin for the molecular visualization platform PyMOL, packaged with a graphical user interface (GUI), easy automatic installation, and novel features developed through strong integration with PyMOL's application programming interface (API). In addition to ProteinCT tools, the plugin includes CT tools for studying the dynamics of disordered proteins. Analysis of a representative protein trajectory confirms that the original functionality of ProteinCT is retained, the GUI is functional, easy to use, and visually clear, and the additional features are seamlessly integrated with PyMOL, making protein circuit topology widely accessible to researchers in structural biology and related fields.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative holo-omic data analysis predicts interactions across the host-microbiome axis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Merkesvik, J., Langa, J., +9 authors, Hvidsten, T. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the interplay between host organisms and their microbiomes is central to the development of sustainable food systems. However, high dimensionality and spurious associations remain major obstacles to extracting meaningful biological insight from multi-omic host-associated microbiome data; a challenge further exacerbated when "holo-omic" analyses across the host-microbiome boundary is considered. Here, we show that a computational method designed for multi-omic analysis in eukaryotes can be leveraged to integrate and analyse five layers of holo-omic data from porcine hosts and their gut microbiomes. We collected caecal tissue and digesta samples during a feeding trial that tested the impact of microbiota-directed fibres (acetylated galactoglucomannan) at critical developmental stages. From 800,000 features including microbial and host genes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metabolites from caecal tissue and digesta, we used multiset correlation and factor analysis to select the most relevant features for capturing coordinated patterns across omic layers. From these features, we predicted over 2,000 putative host-microbiome interactions based on co-occurrence. Some of them reflected previously known relationships between animal and microbiome features, such as microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism being linked to glycoside abundances in host tissue. Other predicted co-occurrences included features that were not detected in single-omic analysis and offer new hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions that warrant future investigation. Hence, we showcase an application of holo-omic analysis that avoids common pitfalls in high-dimensional data analysis; identifies known interactions as a form of validation; and most importantly, predicts new leads for understanding host-microbiome symbiosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omics integration and batch correction using a modality-agnostic deep learning framework</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Alvira Larizgoitia, J. I., Partel, G., +21 authors, Sifrim, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> State-of-the-art biotechnologies allow the detection of different molecular species on the same biological sample, generating complex highly-dimensional multi-modal datasets. Gaining a holistic understanding of biological phenomena, such as oncogenesis or aging, requires integrating these diverse modalities into low-dimensional data representations while correcting for technical artifacts. Here we present MIMA, a modular, unsupervised AI framework for multi-omics data integration and batch correction. Applied to complex spatial and single-cell datasets, MIMA effectively removes batch effects, while preserving biologically relevant information, and learns representations predictive of expert pathologist annotations. Additionally, it enables cross-modal translation, uncovers molecular patterns not captured by manual annotations, and performs on par with specialized state-of-the-art tools, despite being modality-agnostic. MIMA's flexibility and scalability make it a powerful tool for multimodal data analysis. MIMA provides a foundation for AI-based, multi-omics augmented digital pathology frameworks, offering new opportunities for improved patient stratification and precision medicine through the comprehensive integration of high-dimensional molecular data and histopathological imaging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tracing the origins of molecular signals in food through integrative metabolomics and chemical databases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mendoza Cantu, A., Gauglitz, J., Bittremieux, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Foods contain thousands of chemical constituents beyond macronutrients, including bioactive metabolites, processing by-products, and contaminants that remain poorly characterized. The Periodic Table of Food Initiative (PTFI) is establishing a standardized global reference for food composition using untargeted mass spectrometry. We analyzed the first PTFI release (~24,000 molecular features across 500 foods) by linking annotated and unannotated signals to curated databases of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, food contact chemicals, and natural products. Annotated compounds revealed characteristic chemical patterns across food groups, while unannotated features exposed xenobiotic signatures and potential contamination pathways. A taxonomy-aware search identified unexpected natural products, such as biochanin A and phlorizin produced by Canada thistle. Together, these analyses show how agricultural practices, environmental exposures, and processing shape food chemistry and highlight the value of food metabolomics for advancing a One Health understanding of the molecular connections between the environment, food systems, and human health.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">YAP1 defines an emergent, plastic population of relapsed small cell lung cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Stewart, C. A., Ramkumar, K., +21 authors, Gay, C. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by rapid onset of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. Transcriptional heterogeneity among treatment-naive SCLC tumors underlies four transcriptional subtypes, each with distinct clinical vulnerabilities. Though previously hypothesized to delineate a distinct subtype, expression of YAP1 is largely absent from treatment-naive, pure SCLC. To characterize relapsed SCLC, circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and core needle biopsies from SCLC patients and preclinical models following resistance to standard-of-care therapies were analyzed. In contrast to treatment-naive SCLC, these analyses reveal an emergent YAP1-positive cell population that coincides with treatment resistance. These YAP1-positive cells exhibit characteristics of drug tolerant persister cells, including senescence, stemness, and plasticity, as YAP1 positive cells largely abandon features characteristic of SCLC to adopt those of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). As a result of this SCLC-like to LCNEC-like evolution, YAP1-positive cells lack several clinically relevant SCLC surface targets (i.e., DLL3, SEZ6), but are enriched for others (i.e., B7-H3, TROP2). We propose a model where YAP1 expressing cells emerge with SCLC treatment resistance and characterize a tenacious subpopulation capable of diverging from the treatment naive lineage and adopting features to evade therapeutic response.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BMAL2 is a druggable target for ARID1A-wildtype ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tan, G. Y. T., Lin, P.-Y., +6 authors, Hwang-Verslues, W. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is highly chemoresistant and has worse clinical outcome at advanced stages than other ovarian cancer subtypes. The most frequent (~50%) alterations in OCCC are AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene (ARID1A) mutations which lead to ARID1A deficiency. However, OCCC that retains ARID1A function differs substantially from ARID1A mutated OCCC. Particularly, targeted therapies that sensitize ARID1A-deficient OCCC to DNA damage are largely ineffective against OCCC with wild-type (wt) ARID1A. Thus, it is important to identify druggable targets and develop targeted therapies specifically for ARID1A-wt OCCC. We identified BMAL2 as a critical OCCC oncogene that promotes tumorigenesis by preventing DNA damage from endogenous origins. BMAL2 depletion altered expression of genes in DNA damage repair pathways, including RAD51, a core enzyme of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. This led to double-stranded break accumulation, decreased cell viability and reduced tumor growth. This dependence on BMAL2 to maintain DNA integrity and cell viability can be a new route to suppress ARID1A-wt OCCC. Consistent with this idea, we found that GW833972A, a cannabinoid receptor agonist, bound BMAL2 with high affinity and facilitated its degradation. This in turn reduced RAD51 expression, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and decreased cell viability. Xenograft models further demonstrated that GW833972A treatment alone inhibited ARID1A-wt OCCC tumor growth. Together, our findings reveal an essential oncogenic role of BMAL2 and demonstrate that it is an appealing therapeutic target, especially for ARID1A-wt OCCC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dietary Serine Restriction Impacts H3K27 and H3K4 Methyl Epigenomes to Impede Head and Neck Cancer Cell Plasticity and Tumor Growth</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jankowski, S. A., Kroehling, L., +4 authors, Kukuruzinska, M. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Head and neck cancer with its major subsite, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is a devastating malignancy with limited treatment options. Given that recent advances in nutritional interventions have been recognized as potential strategies for targeting cancer, we investigated the role of dietary serine restriction in OSCC cell plasticity. Utilizing multiple human OSCC-derived cell lines and an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of OSCC, we interrogated the impact of serine deprivation on this malignancy through biochemical assays, transcriptomic analyses, and CUT&amp;RUN sequencing, as well as impact on tumor growth and its immune environment. We report that human OSCC cells behaved like serine auxotrophs, depending on exogenous serine for growth and maintenance of plastic cell states. We show that dietary restriction of serine induced endogenous serine synthesis and generated alpha-ketoglutarate (KG), a co-substrate for JMJD3 nuclear dioxygenase, which demethylates H3K27me3 and de-represses differentiation genes. This was accompanied by the reduction of H3K4me3 at stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes caused. Likewise, dietary serine restriction inhibited orthotopic OSCC isograft growth in mice concomitant with downregulation of H3K27me3 and increased immune infiltration in the tumor periphery. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the epigenetic etiology of OSCC that reveals the interplay between serine metabolism and epigenetic molecular mechanisms driving OSCC cell plasticity and tumorigenesis. The dependence of OSCC cells on exogenous serine to maintain plastic cell states offers a unique opportunity to utilize a non-toxic dietary serine restriction as an intervention treatment either alone or in combination with other therapies for OSCC patients.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Dantas, E. C., Murthy, A., +23 authors, Goncalves, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death and is frequently accompanied by reduced food intake and cachexia, a debilitating syndrome characterized by weight loss and skeletal muscle wasting. We sought to identify contributors to cachexia using a murine model of lung cancer that reproduces key features of this syndrome. A multiplex cytokine screening approach, integrated with western blot and transcriptomic analyses, identified tumor-derived inflammatory mediators and downstream signaling pathways associated with cachexia. Notably, IL-6 superfamily members were elevated in the tumor and plasma of mice and patients with cachexia. The JAK-STAT3 signaling was upregulated in liver and skeletal muscle, driving the acute phase response and impairing lipid metabolism. Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK1/2 with ruxolitinib improved body weight, fat mass, and overall survival without altering tumor burden. These effects were driven primarily by blunted hypothalamic leptin receptor signaling, which increased food intake early in the disease course. In the liver, JAK inhibition reduced STAT3 activity, restored fatty acid oxidation, and decreased the production of acute-phase proteins. These findings support JAK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for lung cancer-associated cachexia.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tumor-associated macrophages protect glioblastoma cells from ferroptosis by inducing the release of ferritin-bound iron via exosomes.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sahu, A. P., Palsa, K., +2 authors, Connor, J. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-tumor cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and act as the pivotal cell type in regulating iron metabolism in the GBM tumor microenvironment. High TAM infiltration into the TME is also associated with increased resistance to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death. However, the exact mechanism by which TAMs make the cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis remains relatively unexplored. Here, we have investigated how TAMs modify iron metabolism in GBM cells to make them more resistant to ferroptotic stress. We utilized GL261 cells, a GBM cell line derived from C57BL6 mice, and syngeneic primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) to study GBM-TAM interactions in vitro. We found that male macrophages exhibited higher iron uptake, greater iron storage, and a larger labile iron pool compared to female macrophages, indicating intrinsic sex biases in macrophage iron metabolism. Subsequently, we used co-culture experiments to study how macrophages regulate the iron and ferroptotic status of GL261 cells. We discovered that GL261 cells cocultured with BMDMs showed higher resistance to RSL3-induced ferroptotic stress. Mechanistically, BMDMs caused a decrease in total cellular iron in GL261 cells by inducing increased H-ferritin-bound iron release via CD63-positive exosomes; thus, limiting the amount of iron that is available for lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis. This process was moderately sex biased in favor of male macrophages. Finally, we show that this mechanism of BMDM-induced resistance to ferroptosis is independent of Hepcidin regulation and can act as a possible pathway by which GBM cells escape ferroptotic stress during proinflammatory conditions.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Chen, C., Gribbin, K., +17 authors, Xia, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and poor prognosis. While major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) expression is traditionally associated with professional antigen-presenting cells, its role in PDAC malignant cells remains underexplored. Herein, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and ex vivo studies in culture with both human and murine models to investigate the prognostic relevance of MHC-II expression in malignant PDAC cells. Elevated MHC-II expression in malignant cells was strongly associated with increased infiltration of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in human PDAC, and pronounced co-localization with plasma cells, indicative of an antigen-activated immune microenvironment. In the KPC mouse model of PDAC, pharmacologic induction of MHC-II expression by cobimetinib treatment in malignant epithelial cells significantly enhanced the therapeutic response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). These findings highlight the role of malignant cell-intrinsic MHC-II expression in promoting antigen presentation and fostering an anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Our results position MHC-II as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in PDAC, paving the way for novel immunomodulatory strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Drosophila Sociality Influences Immune Peptide Load and Apoptosis-induced Tumor Suppression independently of the Antitumor Peptide Defensin</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Delamotte, P., Akiki, P., +5 authors, Montagne, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Patients social environment might influence cancer outcome. This potentially happens in Drosophila, as we previously reported that the social context influences the growth of intestinal tumors. To uncover the underlying social-induced physiological mechanisms, we performed RNA-seq of isogenized beheaded tumorous Drosophila. Importantly, expression of several immune peptides varied according to the social-induced tumor growth effect. Furthermore, ectopic expression in tumors of the apoptotic-inhibitor p35 suppressed the social-induced effect. Next, we challenged the immune peptide Defensin, previously reported to suppress imaginal disc tumor growth through a cell-death/JNK-dependent network. Nonetheless, the social-induced tumor suppression was maintained upon Defensin overexpression or JNKK-knockdown in tumors, and in defensin mutants. Surprisingly, tumor growth was reduced in the latter, indicating that Defensin sustains the growth of these intestinal tumors. In summary, our study indicates that the social context affects the immune response and that a given immune peptide may have opposite effects depending on tumor type.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Human cortico-vascular assembloids reveal a CELF2-AHNAK-dependent switch from neuronal to endothelial tropism in glioblastoma cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bertacchi, M., Ladoux, A., +11 authors, Virolle, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GB) remains one of the most aggressive human cancers, driven by profound cellular plasticity and dynamic interactions with the neurovascular niche. Yet, existing preclinical models fail to reproduce the human brain-vascular interface, limiting studies of tumor-host crosstalk and invasion. To overcome this gap, we developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortico-endothelial (CO+EO) assembloid model by fusing cortical and endothelial organoids from the same genetic background. These assembloids spontaneously form branched vascular networks enriched in tight junction proteins (CLDN5, OCLN, ZO-1), thereby recapitulating a key blood-brain barrier (BBB)-like property and providing a physiologically relevant human platform for exploring glioblastoma-neurovascular interactions. Using this system, we uncover a previously unrecognized CELF2-dependent glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) tropism. CELF2-expressing GSCs preferentially infiltrate neural regions, where they trigger neuronal apoptosis and disrupt endothelial tight junction integrity, supporting an aggressive phenotype. Conversely, CELF2-deficient GSCs lose neurotropism, acquire mesenchymal features, and are redirected toward vascular compartments. This endothelial affinity requires the scaffold protein AHNAK, strongly expressed at the plasma membrane of CELF2-deficient cells and enriched at tumor-endothelial interfaces. AHNAK knockdown abolished endothelial infiltration, demonstrating its critical role in vascular tropism. Analysis of patient GB samples confirmed that CELF2-positive tumor cells are enriched in poorly vascularized, mitotically active areas and excluded from vessel-rich zones, closely paralleling assembloid findings. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that CELF2 promotes a neuronal progenitor-like program while repressing mesenchymal and vascular-associated gene expression, thereby shaping tumor identity, invasive behavior, and tissue preference. Collectively, our study introduces CO+EO assembloids as an original human model of glioblastoma plasticity at the neurovascular interface. We identify CELF2 as a master regulator of GSC tropism and AHNAK as a mediator of vascular affinity, unveiling a novel molecular axis that governs glioblastoma invasion and highlighting new therapeutic opportunities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Global DNA methylation signatures associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis of high grade serous ovarian cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hafiza Bushra Manzoor, Melisa Acun, +4 authors, Meshach Asare-Werehene</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ovarian cancer (OVCA) is third most lethal gynecologic cancers and acquired chemoresistance is the key link in the high mortality rate of OVCA patients. Currently, there are no reliable methods to predict chemoresistance in OVCA. In our study, we identify genes, pathways and networks altered by DNA methylation in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) cells that are associated with chemoresistance and prognosis of HGSC patients. We performed methylome-wide profiling using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (HM850K) methylation array on a set of HGSC chemoresistant and chemosensitive cell lines. Differentially Methylated CpG Probes (DMPs) were identified between the resistant and sensitive groups in HGSC. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) over-representation analyses were conducted to identify both common and unique pathways between resistant and sensitive cells. While the HM850K array was used for the discovery phase to identify differentially methylated probes and regions in HGSC cell lines, the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer (TCGA-OV) dataset generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (27 K array) methylation array served as an independent validation cohort for downstream survival and drug sensitivity analyses. Machine learning methods were applied to our dataset to predict drug sensitivity in the TCGA-OV cohort and to investigate associations with overall survival and progression-free survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the relationship between differentially methylated genes and patient survival outcomes. The overlapping CpG probes shared between the two Illumina platforms were used for machine learning and survival analyses. Data visualization was performed using various R/Bioconductor packages. Our analysis identified a total of 3,641 DMPs spanning 1,617 differentially methylated genes between chemoresistant and sensitive HGSC cells, whereas 80% of them were hypermethylated CpG sites associated with HGSC resistant cells. Approximately half of the DMPs were distributed on chromosomes 1-3, 6, 11-12 and 17 and top identified hypermethylated CpGs were cg21226224 (SOX17, ∆β = 79%, adj.P = 7.73E-03), cg02538901 (ATP1A1, ∆β = 75%, adj.P = 7.6E-03), and cg17032184 (CD58, ∆β = 64%, adj.P = 4.39E-02). Machine learning analysis identified significant association of global hypermethylation in the HGSC chemoresistant cells with poor overall and progression-free survival of HGSC patients. Further analysis identified four differentially methylated genes (CD58, SOX17, FOXA1, ETV1) that were also positively associated with poor prognosis of HGSC OC patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed enrichment of several cancer-related pathways, including phosphatidylinositol signaling, homologous recombination and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. This study supplements the current knowledge of the underlying mechanism behind acquired chemoresistance in OVCA. Four differentially methylated genes identified in this study may have the potential to serve as promising epigenetic clinical biomarkers for HGSC chemotherapy resistance.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Emily So, Sikander Hayat, +2 authors, Benjamin Haibe-Kains</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interactions between cells coordinate various functions across cell-types in health and disease states. Novel single-cell techniques enable deep investigation of cellular crosstalk at single-cell resolution. Cell-cell communication (CCC) is mediated by underlying gene-gene networks, however most current methods are unable to account for complex interactions within the cell as well as incorporate the effect of pathway and protein complexes on interactions. This results in the inability to infer overarching signalling patterns within a dataset as well as limit the ability to successfully explore other data types such as spatial cell dimension. Therefore, to represent transcriptomic data as intricate networks, complementing gene expression with information from cells to ligands and receptors for relevant CCC inference, we present GraphComm-a new graph-based deep learning method for predicting CCC in single-cell RNAseq datasets. GraphComm improves CCC inference by capturing detailed information such as cell location and intracellular signalling patterns from a database of more than 30,000 protein interaction pairs. With this framework, GraphComm is able to predict biologically relevant results in datasets previously validated for CCC, datasets that have undergone chemical or genetic perturbations and datasets with spatial cell information.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Decoding Cervical Cancer Biomarkers: An Integrated Framework of Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, and Experimental Confirmation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kamble P, Dubey K, +4 authors, Garg P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in females, with a high mortality rate globally. Persistent infection with high-risk, oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a critical etiologic factor in the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, cervical cancer often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages, hence limiting treatment effectiveness. Therefore, identifying precise and significant biomarkers is crucial. High-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized targeted cancer therapy research by generating extensive data for analysis. This study employed bioinformatics and machine learning (ML) approaches to identify dysregulated genes with significant diagnostic value in cervical cancer, utilizing transcriptomics datasets. Seven potential diagnostic biomarker genes (APOD, SPARCL1, AR, MCM2, NUSAP1, PLK1, and STIL) were validated by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiment. The ML models were developed using significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in important pathways for cervical cancer. ML prediction models are available at https://github.com/PGlab-NIPER/CC_Pred.</p>
