<h2 class="paper-title">Pragmatic analysis with knowledge-guided for unraveling peptide-protein pairwise non-covalent mechanisms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, S., Yan, K., +2 authors, Liu, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding peptide-protein interactions is vital for decoding cellular signaling and developing targeted therapies. However, the complexity of multi-molecular associations and diverse non-covalent interactions make accurate prediction and site-specific annotation challenging. Here, we propose KGIPA, a knowledge-guided pragmatic analysis framework that incorporates pragmatic concepts from natural language into life science, capturing the influence of biological environments on non-covalent interactions. KGIPA integrates intra- and extra-linguistic contextual information to combine multimodal single-molecule features and build residue-level interaction maps. It also uses biological prior knowledge to coordinate various non-covalent interaction types. Benchmark tests demonstrate KGIPA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in evaluating molecular binding, including protein and peptide binding residues and residue-pair interactions. Furthermore, KGIPA demonstrates strong performance in peptide-protein binding affinity prediction and peptide virtual screening. Wet-lab experiments validate its reliability, revealing high consistency between predicted and experimentally measured binding behaviors. These results highlight KGIPA's potential to accelerate peptide drug discovery and establish pragmatic analysis as an effective paradigm for decoding the molecular language of interactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhancing Pan-cancer Spatial Transcriptomics atSingle-cell Resolution with stPainter</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, Y., Luo, Y., +8 authors, Chen, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Subcellular spatial transcriptomics technologies offer unprecedented views of tissue architecture but are fundamentally constrained by sparse gene panels and limited detection sensitivity. Current computational enhancement strategies typically rely on tissue-matched single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) references and necessitate computationally intensive retraining for each dataset, impeding their scalability and clinical applicability. Here, we present stPainter, a conditional generative model that leverages a massive pretraining pan-cancer scRNA-seq atlas to universally enhance spatial transcriptomics data. Built upon a latent diffusion architecture with stochastic differential equation-guided generation, stPainter learns a universal manifold of cellular states to reconstruct genome-wide expression profiles from sparse spatial measurements. Uniquely, our pretraining paradigm enables zero-shot generalization and empowers downstream tasks by providing imputed transcriptomes and informative latent variables to enhance resolution at both the gene and cluster levels. Applied stPainter upon 6 spatial transcriptomics datasets of different cancer types, we demonstrate that our model empowers high-fidelity downstream analyses, including fine-grained subpopulation clustering and pathway enrichment. Furthermore, cross-validation with spatially resolved proteomics (CODEX) confirms the biological veracity of the imputed cellular landscapes. stPainter provides a robust, scalable framework for decoding complex tumor microenvironments without the need for auxiliary sequencing data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PEPsRNA: A computational resource of experimentally tested peptide based siRNA delivery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dar, S., Kumar, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In siRNA-based applications, cellular delivery remains one of the main hurdles. Many formulations are tested for the same and peptides came up as one of the optimal options. The latter have various advantages like natural biological presence, high specificity, and natural metabolism etc. siRNA in conjugation with peptides have exhibited enhanced mRNA silencing. Peptides aid siRNAs in condensation to smaller volumes, enhance nuclease protection, increase half-life, promote cell specific binding as well as endosomal escape and release in cytosol. Despite its prime importance, no resource is available for the peptide-based delivery of siRNAs, therefore to fill the gap we developed PEPsRNA web server. It includes 2266 entries of 270 different kinds of peptides, 106 different types of siRNAs and shRNAs along with more than 80 conjugate molecules targeting 55 different genes, experimentally tested for the delivery of the siRNAs. To provide the detailed insights of the procedure, we have incorporated analysis of the peptides (e.g. secondary structure, amino acid composition, polarity, hydrophobicity etc.), siRNAs (e.g. secondary structures with minimum free energies etc.) and associated conjugate molecules (e.g. structure, SMILES, Inchl). We have derived these values using various other tools and resources to make the web server comprehensive. We further compared various physicochemical properties with the efficacy of the peptide based on the target gene silencing, but these properties do not shown any distinct conclusive relationship. The data is available for browsing, searching and downloading freely on the web server with URL: http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/pepsirna.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PathoResist AI: A One-Click Web Platform for Rapid Pathogen Resistance Analysis Based on the all_ratio Algorithm</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mai, G., Dai, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study introduces a one-stop analysis platform named PathoResistAI (https://www.resistpath.com/), which can be used to solve the technical bottlenecks of pathogenic microorganism detection and antimicrobial resistance analysis. The platform is based on nanopore sequencing and the innovative all-ratio algorithm, which integrates four-dimensional parameters (sequence similarity, abundance, matching number, and matching length), significantly improving the detection accuracy of low-abundance pathogens and drug-resistance genes. The platform adopts four layers of modular design (input layer, core engine, dual-channel output, and visualization layer). Users only need to upload data in FASTQ format, and they can obtain automated reports, including pathogen identification and drug-resistance gene prediction within 30 min. The verification results show that the platform can accurately identify bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens), viruses (e.g., Ebola virus), and drug-resistance genes (e.g., SdeY), which are consistent with the published literature results. Limitations include only supporting long-read sequencing data, small sample size (fewer than 50 cases), and lack of real clinical sample verification. In general, this platform represents the application and exploration of nanopore sequencing in the field of rapid detection of pathogenic microorganisms, and provides a new tool for microbial pathogen or AMR detection research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Membrane Kymograph Generator: A cross-platform GUI software for automated generation and analysis of kymographs along dynamic cell boundaries</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Banerjee, T., Abubaker-Sharif, B., +1 author, Iglesias, P. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Summary: The plasma membrane and accompanying cortex serve as one of the major hubs of the signal transduction and cytoskeletal activities that collectively regulate numerous cell physiological processes such as migration, polarity, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, cytokinesis, etc. Yet, dynamically tracking membrane-cortex associated protein or lipid kinetics over time from live-cell image series remains a challenging task, primarily due to the difficulty of accurately extracting and aligning the cell boundary between consecutive frames, as the cell continuously deforms and moves. Here, we present Membrane Kymograph Generator, a cross-platform software that accepts multichannel time-lapse live-cell fluorescent imaging datasets as input and automates the cumbersome, heuristic process of boundary tracking, inter-frame alignment, and intensity sampling along the boundary. The software implements a rotational offset minimization algorithm that circularly aligns boundaries across consecutive frames by exhaustively searching for the optimal angular shift that minimizes point-to-point distances, while handling variations in boundary point counts due to cell shape changes. The software outputs kymographs that represent spatiotemporal dynamics of different membrane-associated proteins or biosensors, allows users to fine-tune visualization parameters through an interactive interface, and provides built-in correlation analysis tools for multi-channel datasets. Furthermore, the software allows advanced programmatic usage for batch processing and further analysis via a native API. Our validation tests demonstrated that the Membrane Kymograph Generator can be used to accurately track, visualize, and quantitate the spatial kinetics of a wide array of membrane proteins and lipid biosensors over extended time periods, in a variety of cell types, including Dictyostelium amoeba, human neutrophils, mouse macrophages, and different mammalian cancer cells. The GUI-based software is user-friendly, does not require any technical expertise from users, and significantly reduces the manual effort and time required for kymograph generation and downstream analysis, while ensuring high accuracy and reproducibility. Availability and Implementation: Membrane Kymograph Generator is a free and open-source software, licensed under GNU General Public License 3.0 or later. This software is cross-platform: It can be graphically installed on both x86-64 and AArch64/ARM64 computers, running either Windows, macOS, or any standard Linux distribution. The software is distributed as single installer files (and portable executables) targeting specific hardware architectures and operating systems, and hence, it can be installed natively without any dependency resolution. The source code, detailed documentation, specific installers, portable binaries, and test data are freely available at https://github.com/tatsatb/membrane-kymograph-generator. Additionally, since the software is written in Python, it can also be installed inside any Python environment using PIP package manager (package ID: https://pypi.org/project/membrane-kymograph) and can also be interacted via a built-in Python API.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">On the Accuracy of Internal Circadian Time Prediction Methods from a Single Sample</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gorczyca, M. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological processes ranging from gene expression to sleep-wake cycles display oscillations with an approximately 24-hour period, or circadian rhythms. A challenge in analyzing circadian rhythms is that these rhythms vary across individuals and are based on an individual's internal circadian time (ICT), which is uniquely offset relative to the 24-hour day-night cycle time (zeitgeber time, or ZT). Many model-based methods have been proposed to predict ICT given an individual's biomarker measurements. However, the prediction accuracy of these methods is rarely validated using known ICT. In this article, we evaluate this accuracy for three state-of-the-art model-based methods: COFE, partial least squares regression, and TimeSignature. We find that if a single sample is obtained from each individual and a model is fit using only biomarker measurements as predictors, then ZT predicts ICT more accurately than any of the model-based ICT predictions. However, we also find that TimeSignature can outperform ZT when the model incorporates sine and cosine transforms of sample collection ZT as two additional predictors. These findings are based on analysis of three circadian transcriptome datasets as well as simulation studies, and highlight the importance of accounting for individual-level differences in biomarker oscillations to improve ICT prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Disentangled multimodal evolutionary representations for cross-virus predictive modeling of antigenic change</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Z., Lin, Y., +3 authors, Yu, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antigenic evolution drives immune escape and complicates early assessment of emerging pathogens, especially when genomic surveillance is sparse and functional measurements lag behind real-world spread. Early prediction and generalization to unknown viruses require faithful and information-rich representations of viral evolution, a need that is not fully addressed by existing protein language model-based approaches. Here we introduce DERIVE, a flow-based generative framework that learns a disentangled latent representation of multimodal evolutionary history by integrating sequence homology with physicochemical and structural features. Using only pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 sequences, DERIVE prioritizes high-risk mutations, reconstructs strain-level evolutionary trajectories, forecasts immune escape and prevalence trends, and produces mutation-level effect maps. The learned representation transfers robustly across viral families, with strong concordance to functional data for influenza virus, HIV, rabies lyssavirus and chikungunya virus. Together, these results position DERIVE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for anticipating antigenic evolution and supporting early, actionable assessment of future "Disease X" threats.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Reproducible Tools and Enhanced Computational Workflows for Batch Effect Evaluation of High-Throughput Data Using BatchQC</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Anderson, J. K., Zhang, J., +12 authors, Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Batch effect correction is a common and often necessary step in -omics and imaging data analysis to reduce bias due to technical and experimental factors when combining multiple batches of data. The severity of the batch effects dictates the correction strategy; therefore, a careful assessment of each dataset's batch effects is necessary. BatchQC is an R package that provides reproducible tools and visualizations for quantitatively and qualitatively addressing batch effects across a broad range of data types. BatchQC integrates with standardized Bioconductor data structures and features an object-oriented design, enabling the application of workflows that can freely evaluate and process data within and outside the package tools. Common batch evaluation methods, such as clustering, kBET, and differential expression, along with novel quantitative metrics, help determine the benefits of batch correction for each dataset and enable direct comparisons between methods. Additionally, BatchQC employs methods that assess the distributional fit of several commonly used distributions for -omics data. Importantly, these goodness-of-fit methods are not only relevant to batch effect evaluation but also apply to other analytical scenarios, like differential expression. Here, we present BatchQC as the first comprehensive batch-correction R package, with independent tools, reproducible workflows, visualization, and novel statistics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrated multi-omics profiling uncovers the epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic landscape of prostate cancer progression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pedersen, C. A., Wess, M., +5 authors, Tessem, M.-B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer is essential for the development of precise diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we applied unsupervised multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) to integrate DNA methylation, gene expression, and metabolic profiles derived from the same individuals, aiming to characterize the biological landscape of normal, malignant, and aggressive prostate tissue. Our analysis identified distinct molecular pathways associated with aggressive disease, specifically those involved in zinc metabolism, cell cycle regulation, smooth muscle architecture, immune activation, and tissue morphology. Key metabolites within the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and lipid pathways were central to these signatures. Furthermore, we observed a consistent co-enrichment of SP1 and CTCFL binding regions among factor-associated CpGs, suggesting a model of global epigenetic reprogramming. These findings indicate a novel interplay between Polycomb deregulation, CTCFL-mediated chromatin remodeling, and SP1-driven transcriptional activation in shaping the prostate cancer epigenome. Apart from immune activation, the identified molecular signatures were validated in the TCGA cohort and demonstrated significant predictive value for disease recurrence. Overall, these results underscore the power of multi-omics integration in providing a holistic understanding of prostate cancer biology and its potential for clinical translation into prognostic biomarkers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of a type 1 diabetes-associated T cell receptor repertoire signature from the human peripheral blood.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Puneet Rawat, Melanie R Shapiro, +24 authors, Todd M Brusko</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated disease with a strong immunogenetic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) dependence. HLA allelic influence on the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire shapes thymic selection and controls activation of diabetogenic clones yet remains largely unresolved in T1D. We sequenced the circulating TCRβ chain repertoire from 2250 HLA-typed participants across three cross-sectional cohorts, including individuals with T1D and healthy related and unrelated controls. We found that HLA risk alleles show higher restriction of TCR repertoires in individuals with T1D. We leveraged deep learning to identify T1D-associated TCR subsequence motifs that were also observed in independent TCR cohorts residing in pancreas-draining lymph nodes of individuals with T1D. Collectively, our data demonstrate T1D-related TCR motif enrichment based on genetic risk, offering a potential metric for autoreactivity and groundwork for TCR-based diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Computational assessment of the relationship between metabolism and histone methylation in cancer cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mohammad Rasouli Koohi, Mahya Mehrmohamadi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aberrant histone methylation and metabolic alterations are key hallmarks of cancer. Metabolic reprogramming during tumorigenesis could impact the histone methylation pattern by altering the availability of substrates and cofactors required for histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (HDMs) activities. Despite advances in understanding this complex interplay, quantitative information about the contributions of specific metabolic shifts and histone methylation dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we used multi-omics data integrated with machine learning models to discover key metabolites, genes, and pathways predictive of histone methylation levels in cancer cell lines. Our cell line models highlighted the significant role of metabolites associated with one-carbon, nucleotide, redox and lipid metabolism on histone marks. Validation in primary tumors confirmed the cell line models' findings. Overall, this study quantifies the contributions of the metabolic network to histone methylation variation in cancer cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Prognostic pan-cancer and single-cancer models: A large-scale analysis using a real-world clinico-genomic database.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sarah F McGough, Svetlana Lyalina, +7 authors, Robert Tibshirani</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prognostic models in oncology have a profound impact on personalized cancer care and patient profiling, but tend to be heterogeneously developed and implemented in narrow patient cohorts. Here, we develop and benchmark multiple machine learning models to predict survival in pan-cancer and 16 single-cancer settings using a de-identified clinico-genomic database of 28,079 US patients with cancer. We identify key predictors of cancer prognosis, including 15 shared across seven or more cancer types, revealing strong consistency in cancer prognostic factors. We demonstrate that pan-cancer models generally outperform or match single-cancer models in predicting survival and risk stratifying patients, especially in smaller cancer cohorts, suggesting a unique transfer learning advantage of pan-cancer models. This work demonstrates the potential of pan-cancer approaches in enhancing the accuracy and applicability of prognostic models in oncology, paving the way for more personalized and effective cancer care strategies.</p>
