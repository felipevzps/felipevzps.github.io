<h2 class="paper-title">A bibliometric study on mathematical oncology: interdisciplinarity, internationality, collaboration and trending topics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kira Pugh, Linnéa Gyllingberg, +1 author, Sara Hamis</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mathematical oncology is an interdisciplinary research field where the mathematical sciences meet cancer research. Being situated at the intersection of these two fields makes mathematical oncology highly dynamic, as practicing researchers are incentivised to quickly adapt to both technical and medical research advances. Determining the scope of mathematical oncology is therefore not straightforward; however, it is important for purposes related to funding allocation, education, scientific communication, and community organisation. To address this issue, we here conduct a bibliometric analysis of mathematical oncology. We compare our results to the broader field of mathematical biology, and position our findings within theoretical science-of-science frameworks. Based on article metadata and citation flows, our results provide evidence that mathematical oncology has undergone a significant evolution since the 1960s marked by increased interactions with other disciplines, geographical expansion, larger research teams, and greater diversity in studied topics. The latter finding contributes to the greater discussion on which models different research communities consider to be valuable in the era of big data and machine learning. Further, the results presented in this study quantitatively motivate that international collaboration networks should be supported to enable new countries to enter and remain in the field, and that mathematical oncology benefits both mathematics and the life sciences.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Privacy-Preserving Genomic Data Sharing via Hybrid AES/ECC and Blockchain-Based Dynamic Consent</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Soundararajan, J., Zhuang, Y., Xu, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genomic data are growing exponentially, creating opportunities for discovery but also raising significant concerns regarding privacy, security, and governance. We present a framework that encrypts genome-scale files using AES-256-GCM and protects keys per recipient via Curve25519, anchors only content identifiers and encrypted keys on a blockchain smart contract, and stores ciphertext off-chain in IPFS. The design enables dynamic, auditable consent through on-chain access-control lists (grant/revoke with immutable events) while keeping raw genomes off-chain. A working prototype on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet demonstrates end-to-end registration, retrieval, and revocation. Experiments on the human reference genome (hg38) and synthetic sequences demonstrate near-AES performance for multi-gigabyte files and strong diffusion, as per the avalanche criterion. By separating the data plane (symmetric encryption) from the control plane (public-key keying + smart contracts), the system delivers practical, privacy-preserving genomic data sharing suitable for IRB-approved cohort and clinical workflows.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Do 5' regions of human protein-coding genes contain the blueprints for alternative splicing?</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Thomas, W., Moulinier, L., +3 authors, Poch, O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To investigate alternative splicing capacity, we statistically compared the properties of human protein-coding genes with multiple transcript isoforms (MISOG) and single transcript isoforms (SISOG). Apart from global exon content, differential features are concentrated in the 5' gene regions, with MISOG presenting complex 5' untranslated region architecture and a distinctive flanking environment around first 5' intron. Importantly, we found that 5' exons are more prone to alternative splicing in MISOG. These results unravel previous observations indicating the importance of 5' gene regions in some transcriptional processes and call for their reassessment in light of the MISOG/SISOG profiles.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">pmultiqc: An open-source, lightweight, and metadata-oriented QC reporting library for MS proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yue, Q.-X., Dai, C., +15 authors, Perez-Riverol, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing scale and complexity of proteomics data demand robust, scalable, and interpretable quality control (QC) frameworks to ensure data reliability and reproducibility. Here, we present pmultiqc, an open-source Python package that standardizes and generates web-based QC reports across multiple proteomics data analysis platforms. Built on top of the widely adopted MultiQC framework, pmultiqc offers specialized modules tailored to mass spectrometry workflows, with full initial support for quantms, DIA-NN, MaxQuant/MaxDIA, and mzIdentML/mzML-based pipelines. The package computes a wide range of QC metrics, including raw intensity distributions, identification rates, retention time consistency, and missing value patterns, and presents them in interactive, publication-ready reports. By leveraging sample metadata in the SDRF format, pmultiqc enables metadata-aware QC and introduces, for the first time in proteomics, QC reports and metrics guided by standardized sample metadata. Its modular architecture allows easy extension to new workflows and formats. Alongside comprehensive documentation and examples for running pmultiqc locally or integrated into existing workflows, we offer a cloud-based service that enables users to generate QC reports from their own data or public PRIDE datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GeneCAD: Plant Genome Annotation with a DNA Foundation Model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Z.-Y., Berthel, A., +5 authors, Zhai, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate genome annotation remains a bottleneck in plants, where polyploidy and repeat-rich sequence confound homology- and RNA-based pipelines. We introduce GeneCAD, a sequence-only method that predicts complete plant gene models directly from DNA. GeneCAD couples representations from a plant DNA foundation model, PlantCAD2, with a lightweight ModernBERT encoder and a chromosome-wide conditional random field that enforces splice-phase and feature order, and applies a protein language-model screen to suppress repeat-driven open reading frames. To limit label noise, we rank and filter public annotations using a sequence-based masked-motif score and fine-tune on five phylogenetically diverse, high-quality references. Across five held out angiosperms, including the allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum, GeneCAD improves transcript-level F1 by 8-10% on average over Helixer and BRAKER3, increases exact match transcripts, and sharpens boundaries at start/stop codons and splice junctions. By removing dependence on species-matched RNA-seq or proteomics while retaining cross-species accuracy, GeneCAD provides an accurate, scalable route to biologically coherent plant gene models from DNA alone.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TimeFlow 2: an unsupervised cell lineage detection method for flow cytometry data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liarou, M., Matthes, T., Marchand-Maillet, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell lineage detection refers to the inference of differentiation pathways from immature cells to distinct mature cell types. We developed TimeFlow 2, a new method for lineage inference in large flow cytometry datasets. It uses a single static snapshot of unordered cells and does not require prior knowledge of the number of pathways, cell type or temporal labels. TimeFlow 2 uses the cell orderings from TimeFlow and defines coarse cell states along pseudotime segments. By connecting these states, it constructs paths at cell state level. To approximate the trajectory structure, it further groups the paths based on an Optimal Transport-based cost function. We used TimeFlow 2 on three healthy bone marrow samples and accurately assigned monocytes, neutrophils, erythrocytes and B-cells of different maturation stages to four distinct pathways. Marker dynamics across the inferred pathways showed highly correlated patterns for the corresponding lineages in all three patients. We compared the performance of TimeFlow 2 and three other established methods using standard classification and correlation metrics. TimeFlow 2 outperformed the others on flow cytometry datasets and remained competitive on the challenging mass cytometry datasets. Overall, TimeFlow 2 detects biologically informative pathways, allowing bioinformaticians to model and compare marker dynamics across cell lineages in a data-driven way. Source code in Python and tutorials are available at https://github.com/MargaritaLiarou1/TimeFlow2.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Initial Condition Decision to Ensure Reliable Circadian Phase Estimation with Shorter-Term Wearable Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lim, D., Kim, J., +1 author, Kim, J. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Various studies in the medical field highlight the importance of circadian medicine, which optimizes treatment timing based on patients' circadian phases. While the circadian phase has been measured using dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), the gold standard marker, its high cost and time-intensive nature have led to the development of alternative estimation methods. Among these, the most promising method is using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, which simulate the circadian rhythm by using a light exposure profile estimated from sleep data. These ODE models require an initial condition (IC) representing the initial state of the circadian rhythm, which is unknown in real-world settings. However, it is unclear how the uncertainty of IC affects the accuracy of circadian phase estimation. In this study, by using sleep data collected from 28 shift workers using ActiWatch (mean duration = 56 days, range = 34-75 days), we found that [≥]18 days of sleep data are required for the circadian phase to become independent of the subjective IC choice. The result showed that without an accurate IC, circadian phase estimation is dependent on subjective IC choice, meaning that circadian phase estimates in the first 17 days are not reliable. Indeed, these days were reduced to 13 - 15 days on average when previous studies' IC estimation methods were used. To further shorten this length, we developed new IC estimation methods--period- and work history-based sleep methods--that incorporate daily variations in sleep history. Notably, the new methods reduced the number of days required for reliable circadian phase estimation to about seven days. Hence, our approach allows a larger portion of circadian phase estimates from given sleep data to be used as reliable information. The superiority of our methods paves the way for improved circadian phase estimation, ultimately enhancing the practicality of chronotherapy applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Forecast Air Pollution Impacts on Climate Variability and Public Health</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shafaghat, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study presents a machine learning based simulation for predicting air pollution impact on climate temperature fluctuations and human health. Using synthetic data generated through statistical modeling, seven types of air pollution sources and seven key pollutants were simulated. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, and others, were applied to evaluate the correlation between pollution levels, air quality index (AQI), and predicted health impacts. Results indicate strong predictive capabilities of ensemble models for environmental monitoring, demonstrating accuracy levels between 70 to 99%. This approach provides a scalable framework for forecasting pollution-driven health risks where measured data are unavailable.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep-Learning Cortical Registration Guided by Structural and Diffusion MRI and Connectivity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">ZHOU, Z., Li, J., +2 authors, Aganj, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate cortical surface registration is crucial for group-level neuroimaging analyses, yet geometry-based methods often yield suboptimal functional alignment across subjects due to substantial inter-individual variability. We present a novel deep-learning approach that incorporates white matter structural connectivity features from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography into the Joint Surface-based Registration and Atlas Construction (JOSA) framework. Our method generates vertex-wise connectivity maps by detecting streamline-surface intersections, followed by heat diffusion smoothing on the cortical manifold. We combine these connectivity features with scalar diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and structural features as input to JOSA (which we call "JOSAConn"). Evaluated on HCP-YA subjects across 15 task contrasts, our method significantly outperforms FreeSurfer in functional alignment (p &lt; 0.001 for 12 of 15 contrasts). This multimodal approach demonstrates that structural connectivity effectively bridges the gap between cortical geometry and functional organization while maintaining clinical applicability.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NSeqVerify: An Easy-to-Use Desktop Suite for Integrated NGS Data Analysis, from Raw Reads to Taxonomic Assignment</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Reinosa, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: The proliferation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has created a computational bottleneck, especially for researchers lacking specialized bioinformatics training. Standard analysis workflows require mastering multiple command-line tools, hindering exploratory data analysis and delaying scientific discovery. Results: This work presents NSeqVerify, a new cross-platform, open-source desktop software developed in Java, designed to overcome these barriers. NSeqVerify implements a fully integrated genomic workflow within a single, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The suite includes: (1) a preprocessing module for quality control and filtering of FASTQ files; (2) a de novo assembler employing a sophisticated De Bruijn graph algorithm with an iterative multi-k-mer strategy to maximize contiguity; and (3) a taxonomic assignment module that automates BLAST searches against NCBI databases and displays the results in an easily interpretable tabular format. The tool was validated through controlled use cases, demonstrating its ability to accurately reconstruct reference viral genomes (HIV-1) and to deconvolute metagenomic mixtures (HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). The final test consisted of analyzing a real elephant fecal virome (SRA: SRR35776009), where NSeqVerify successfully assembled contigs two of which overlapped and appeared to form a partial 1555 bp genome of a putative Smacovirus, enabling the identification of its capsid protein and the prediction of its 3D structure using AlphaFold. Conclusion and Availability: NSeqVerify democratizes NGS data analysis, providing a robust all-in-one solution that empowers molecular biologists, students, and clinicians to perform end-to-end genomic analyses. The software is freely available under the GNU GPLv3 license at (https://github.com/roberto117343/NSeqVerify).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A functional map of CDK-drug interactions at single amino acid resolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gould, S. I., Acosta, J., +12 authors, Rivera, F. J. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins that drive or support human disease phenotypes are attractive molecular targets for precision therapy, yet most are nominated by knockout studies and then targeted with drugs that inhibit core catalytic pockets. These strategies cannot resolve which residues are essential, whether non-catalytic sites offer better selectivity or potency, or identify on-target resistance mechanisms. We introduce a framework that integrates precision genome editing, mechanistically diverse therapeutics, and computational sequence-structure-function analysis to map protein essentiality and potential druggability at single amino acid resolution. Applying this framework across 9 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and 15 cancer therapeutics, including ATP-competitive inhibitors, PROTACs, and molecular glue degraders, we identify shared and CDK-specific residues critical for cell fitness and drug response, including known resistance mutations and dozens of new variants. The resulting functional maps resolve residue- and mechanism-specific differences in the resistance spectra among agents targeting the same protein. We show that this iterative strategy can also uncover higher order interactions by performing intra- and extragenic epistasis screens to identify residues that mediate on-target and within-family cell fitness and drug resistance. Finally, we find evidence of novel CDK6 mutations in breast cancer patients and concordance between experimental and clinical correlates of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. By mapping residue-level essentiality and forecasting therapy resistance mutations, target-drug interaction maps could inform clinical treatment and guide design of more selective therapeutic molecules.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Macrophage-secreted Pyrimidine Metabolites Confer Chemotherapy Resistance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, C., Wang, Y., +17 authors, Bhatt, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The tumor microenvironment (TME) programs cancer cells to influence therapeutic responses. Macrophages residing in TME switch from pro-phagocytic to tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive phenotypes as cancer develops. While these pro-tumor functions of macrophages are associated with poor outcomes, the underlying mechanisms by which bone-marrow (BM)-associated macrophages fuel myeloid malignancy and their precise contribution to relapse remain undissected. Here, we show expansion of monocyte/macrophage population in leukemia patients post-chemotherapy relapse, and spatial proximity of macrophages to leukemia blasts in the BM niche. This proximity proved functionally consequential--depletion of macrophages delayed leukemia relapse post cytarabine (AraC), a frontline chemotherapy, in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and syngeneic leukemia models. Mechanistically, a pyrimidine metabolite, deoxycytidine (dC), secreted by BM macrophages, is taken up by leukemia cells to directly inhibit deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to hamper AraC activation and subsequent resistance in a cell non-autonomous manner. Diagnosis AML patients exhibited significantly higher circulating dC levels than healthy donors, and dC levels further increased following chemotherapy. SAMHD1, which catalyzes deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) into deoxynucleoside, was highly abundant in macrophages and mediated dC accumulation. Blockade of dC production in mouse and human macrophages via genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SAMHD1 or DHODH, a critical enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, restored AraC sensitivity. Combination with DHODH inhibitors significantly delayed AraC relapse in human PDX and mouse syngeneic AML models. Collectively, we identify a metabolic immune-leukemia crosstalk in which SAMHD1high macrophages mediates chemoresistance by secreting pyrimidine metabolites and propose macrophage metabolic reprogramming as a tractable strategy to overcome TME-driven chemoresistance in myeloid leukemia.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Patel, J. S., Zhou, X., +13 authors, Liang, S. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a key mediator of DNA repair, and its inhibition has become a validated therapeutic strategy in homologous recombination deficient cancers. However, tools for non-invasive assessment of PARP-1-specific expression remain limited. Here, we evaluated [18F]AZD9574, a next-generation PARP-1-selective PET radiotracer. [18F]AZD9574 was tested in a panel of breast, glioblastoma, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Uptake correlated with PARP-1 expression and was dose-dependently blocked by a variety of clinically relevant PARP inhibitors, confirming its binding specificity. In 22Rv1 xenograft mouse models, the tracer demonstrated significant tumor accumulation that was specific to PARP-1, and ex vivo biodistribution confirmed organ uptake consistent with specific tumor binding and PARP-1 expression. Together, these findings establish [18F]AZD9574 as a promising PARP-1-targeted imaging agent with strong potential for advancing cancer research and therapeutic monitoring.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Single recipient cell tracking of tellurium-labeled extracellular vesicle proteomes (TeLEV) identifies EV-driven immunomodulation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bachurski, D., Gholamipoorfard, R., +37 authors, Abed</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate tumor-immune cell communication by carrying protein cargo that can immediately modulate signaling and antigen presentation. Yet mapping the uptake of primary EV proteomes by human immune cells at single-cell resolution has been constrained by a lack of labeling strategies. We show here that TeLEV, a tellurium-based metabolic mass tagging approach that incorporates L-2-tellurienylalanine (TePhe) into EV proteomes, can produce a biologically rare monoisotopic signal, which is detectable by mass cytometry, imaging mass cytometry, and nanoscale SIMS, without perturbing EV morphology, yield, or proteome composition. We applied TeLEV to label primary malignant B-cell-derived EVs (MBC-EVs) from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and could follow EV uptake by distinct cell populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MBC-EV uptake occurred predominantly in cells of myeloid lineages. In direct control experiments with matched secreted proteins, a machine learning approach identified CD123, CD127, and CD25 as key markers distinguishing primary MBC-EV recipients from matched secreted protein recipient cells. Nanoscale imaging enabled localization of EV-delivered proteins within heterochromatin, whereas Te-labeled secreted proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm of recipient cells. We then generated a pan-immune EV uptake atlas by tracing the uptake of primary and cell-line EVs from nine cell lines and six donors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia into 2,977,094 recipient cells across 43 cell types and subpopulations. We found that the uptake of MBC-EVs by myeloid recipients induced monocyte-derived dendritic-cell polarization characterized by the co-expression of the interleukin-receptor triad (IL-RT: CD123, CD127, CD25) identified above. Time-resolved EV uptake analysis showed a rapid, transient expression of CD123/CD127 followed by CD25, both tightly coupled to MBC-EV uptake by myeloid cells. The intensity of IL-RT expression correlated with that of PD-L1 and BCL-2. Using different STAT degraders to bidirectionally modify the EV-induced STAT5 signal, we observed that MBC-EV uptake and IL-RT, PD-L1, and BCL-2 expression increased with STAT3 degradation and decreased with STAT5 degradation. To investigate the functional consequences of the MBC-EV-induced changes, we showed that MBC-EVs in the presence of IL-2 induced a high-CD25 immune state with low cytotoxic and high B cell proliferation. Taken together, TeLEV represents a novel tool for single-cell tracking of EV proteomes, revealing STAT5-dependent immune remodeling of recipient cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Scaffold-free 3D-Cell Co-Culture Model System for the Study of Metastatic Cancer Cell Behavior in the Brain TME</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lazar, I. M., Sarkar, P., Ahuja, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer is a complex disease involving dynamic interactions between cancer, stromal, and infiltrating immune cells, as well as between these cells and the extracellular matrix components of the tumor microenvironment. Brain metastases arise primarily from solid tumors and often result in fatal outcomes. An in-depth understanding of the complex intercellular interactions that evolve in the brain microenvironment is essential to enabling early cancer diagnostics and improving patient outcomes. The protected tumor microenvironment of the brain hinders, however, direct access, impeding the execution of mechanistic studies and limiting the ability to derive meaningful insights. Several in vitro 2D and 3D model systems have been developed to circumvent this problem, none, however, without limitations. The 2D models fail to recapitulate the 3D architecture of the in-vivo environment lacking therefore physiological relevance, while the 3D models present challenges related to the lack of control over cell positioning, lack of vascularization, contamination from non-human scaffolds, batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high production costs. To overcome some of these limitations, we developed an in vitro scaffold-free 3D tumor model system to simulate the in vivo brain metastatic niche. The model was constructed from human brain endothelial cells (HBEC-5i) and two different cancer cell lines derived from breast (MDA-MB-231/triple negative and SK-BR-3/HER2+) and aggressive ovarian (SK-OV-3) cancers. The development of the model relies on a newly identified affinity between the endothelial and cancer cells that enables them to self-assemble in 3D networked constructs, a feature facilitated by the high collagen production by endothelial cells and the secretion of key chemokines by both endothelial and cancer cells. The model mimics the attachment of metastasized cancer cells to the brain microvasculature, enabling the study of temporal changes in endothelial morphology and molecular signaling processes that sustain cancer cell migration, survival, proliferation, and angiogenic processes. Moreover, the model exhibits long-term stability, reproducibility, and effectiveness in evaluating anti-cancer agents. Altogether, the scaffold-free, simple 3D in vitro model systems provides a low cost, physiologically relevant tool for studying the dynamic molecular crosstalk between cancer and brain endothelial cells, and for investigating the fundamental biological processes that unfold in the tumor microenvironment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AI-powered spatial cell phenomics enhances risk stratification in non-small cell lung cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Simon Schallenberg, Gabriel Dernbach, +26 authors, Frederick Klauschen</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Risk stratification remains a critical challenge in non-small cell lung cancer patients for optimal therapy selection. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-powered spatial cellomics approach that combines histology, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and multimodal machine learning to characterize the complex cellular relationships of 43 cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment in a real-world retrospective cohort of 1168 non-small cell lung cancer patients from two large German cancer centers. The model identifies cell niches associated with survival and achieves a 14% and 47% improvement in risk stratification in the two main non-small cell lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, combining niche patterns with conventional cancer staging. Our results show that complex immune cell niche patterns identify potentially undertreated high-risk patients qualifying for adjuvant therapy. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence powered multiplex imaging analyses to better understand the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to cancer progression and to improve risk stratification and treatment selection in non-small cell lung cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging: a review of the technology.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ingram M, Antico M, +3 authors, Harris E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging is now established across a wide range of clinical applications, offering real-time volumetric visualisation of anatomical structures while remaining low-cost, portable, and non-ionising. This topical review provides a comprehensive overview of 3D ultrasound technology, covering established clinical uses as well as emerging innovations that may shape the future role of ultrasound as a volumetric imaging modality. We begin by detailing the principal acquisition techniques, including freehand scanning, mechanically-steered probes, and matrix arrays. This is followed by a review of the current state of the art of both the hardware and software required for 3D ultrasound imaging. We then present a wide range of established clinical applications from a technological perspective including obstetrics, gynaecology, cardiovascular medicine, musculoskeletal imaging, radiation therapy, oncology and surgery. Although 3D ultrasound improves spatial context for diagnostics, reduces operator dependence and is less susceptible to out-of-plane motion, it remains largely a complementary tool to its two-dimensional counterpart. Key challenges persist, including system complexity, data throughput demands, and limitations in real-time rendering and analysis. Further advances in machine learning, miniaturised electronics, and open-source development are expected to drive broader adoption across both high- and low-resource settings.</p>
