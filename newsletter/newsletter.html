<h2 class="paper-title">Towards Understanding the Drivers of Antibody-Antigen Binding</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Khan, O., Kankkunen, M., +5 authors, Joseph-McCarthy, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibody therapeutics are capable of binding to target antigens with a high degree of specificity and affinity. Gaining an understanding of how antibody-antigen interactions are governed can provide valuable insights that may assist with rational paratope design and epitope prediction. In this work, we apply the FTMap algorithm to systematically characterize binding hot spots, regions on a protein surface that contribute disproportionately to molecular recognition, to a set of 50 antibody-antigen complexes. From our analysis, we find that interface hot spots are typically concentrated on the paratope (antibody side) of the interface, indicating that paratopes typically function as hot spot rich environments in which the antigen can bind. Additionally, we observe that hot spot formation on both sides of the interface is particularly enriched by Trp and Tyr residues, underscoring the key role of aromatic side chains with some amphiphilic character in antibody design. Furthermore, we find that when strong interface hot spots are detected, they tend to persist in the apo conformation, suggesting that there is an inherent structural stability that surrounds core interface hot spots. These findings demonstrate the utility of computational solvent mapping for analyzing protein-protein interfaces, and highlights that at least in most cases antibodies drive antibody-antigen interactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ASSESSMENT OF ALPHAFOLD PROTEIN MODELS FOR SMALL-MOLECULE LIGAND DOCKING</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Maidanik, H., Lazou, M., +3 authors, Joseph-McCarthy, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular docking is a powerful computational tool for predicting protein-ligand interactions, widely employed in drug discovery. However, its effectiveness is often constrained by the availability of experimentally resolved X-ray protein structures, a process that is both time consuming and resource-intensive. AlphaFold (AF), a deep learning method, offers an efficient alternative by predicting high-accuracy 3D protein structures directly from amino acid sequences. This study assesses the utility of AF-generated protein models for fragment and larger ligand docking with Glide, a widely used docking approach. The docking workflow is evaluated in an unbiased manner by carrying out binding site identification with FTMap, a binding hot spot prediction software. We show that fragment docking to AF models outperforms docking to the respective unbound protein crystal structures, and performs comparably to docking to the corresponding ligand bound structures when using an unbiased approach. Leveraging computational efficiency of AF model generation, we also employ ensembles of AF models to incorporate protein flexibility. Results show that docking to AF ensembles improves larger-ligand docking compared to docking to singular AF models and outperforms docking to unbound structures. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of integrating AF protein models into docking procedures, highlighting the potential for streamlining computational drug discovery processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Explaining how mutations affect AlphaFold predictions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Clore, M. F., Thole, J. F., +5 authors, Porter, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transformer models, neural networks that learn context by identifying relationships in sequential data, underpin many recent advances in artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, their inner workings are difficult to explain. Here, we find that a transformer model within the AlphaFold architecture uses simple, sparse patterns of amino acids to select protein conformations. To identify these patterns, we developed a straightforward algorithm called Conformational Attention Analysis Tool (CAAT). CAAT identifies amino acid positions that affect AlphaFold's predictions substantially when modified. These effects are corroborated by experiments in several cases. By contrast, modifying amino acids ignored by CAAT affects AlphaFold predictions less, regardless of experimental ground truth. Our results demonstrate that CAAT successfully identifies the positions of some amino acids important for protein structure, narrowing the search space required to make effective mutations and suggesting a framework that can be applied to other transformer-based neural networks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EssTFNet: Integration of Adaptive Time - Frequency and DNA Language Models for Interpretable Human Essential Gene Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ye, D., Yuan, S., +6 authors, Jin, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Essential genes are defined as those that are indispensable for an organism's survival. The loss of function of these genes results in cell death or an inability to complete the normal life cycle. Research on essential genes is pivotal in elucidating the origin and evolution of life, as well as in identifying potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, accurately predicting essential genes is of great scientific importance and has many applications in basic research and the biomedical field. In this study, we propose EssTFNet, a novel and interpretable deep learning framework that combines adaptive time - frequency analysis with a DNA language model to achieve accurate prediction of human essential genes while enabling mechanistic biological interpretation. Specifically, EssTFNet leverages the architecture of ATFNet, which innovatively maps DNA and protein sequences into equivalent time-series signals to extract periodic and non-stationary features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex sequence patterns. Through effective feature selection and architectural optimization, EssTFNet strikes a favorable balance among prediction accuracy, model interpretability, and cross-tissues generalization capability, significantly outperforming current mainstream sequence-based deep learning methods with an AUC of 0.8336 and an AUPR of 0.8212. Additionally, the DeepLIFT attribution method was employed to identify functional motifs closely associated with gene essentiality, offering valuable insights for experimental validation. For the convenience of researchers, we have developed an easy-to-use web server and made it along with the source code in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/QIANJINYDX/EssTFNet. Overall, this study presents a potentially useful methodological framework for human essential genes prediction, which could provide valuable insights for future research and applications in this field.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Influence of Ligands on AlphaFold3 Prediction of Cryptic Pockets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lazou, M., Tuchscherer, F., +1 author, Joseph-McCarthy, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cryptic pockets are binding sites that are formed or exposed upon a conformational change. They represent an important class of potentially druggable binding sites. Reliably predicting cryptic pockets capable of binding ligands, however, remains a challenge. Herein we examine the use of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for generating realistic conformational ensembles that include known cryptic pockets. We find that AF3 is generally able to reproduce the scale of conformational change required for cryptic site formation. When given a cryptic-site ligand for the protein, AF3 predominantly predicts conformations competent to bind the ligand in the cryptic site; without the ligand, conformations lacking the cryptic pocket generally dominate. While the results may reflect a bias toward memorized structural priors, the level of detrimental memorization appears to be limited. We also show that the choice of the ligand can significantly impact the predictions, and that AF3 is able to produce models with the ligand correctly positioned. Variability in ligand position, however, suggests that generating ensembles of co-folded predictions is critical to enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a correct binding mode. Overall, AF3-generated protein-ligand structural ensembles have potential utility in cryptic-site drug discovery, and they can reveal ligands likely to bind to those sites.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Decoupled Representation Learning Improves Generalization in CRISPR Off-Target Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bhargava, N., Goswami, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NetMedGPT - A network medicine foundation model for extensive disease mechanism mining and drug repurposing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Firoozbakht, F., Suwer, S., +6 authors, Baumbach, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Network medicine leverages large biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to model disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic opportunities. However, most deep learning approaches that use KGs in biomedicine remain task-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse applications within a unified framework. Here, we introduce NetMedGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on a large-scale biomedical KG using masked token prediction. By learning contextualized representations of biomedical nodes, NetMedGPT enables unified, zero-shot inference across different drug discovery tasks. Specifically, in five tasks, i.e., predicting the association of drugs with indications, targets, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, and off-label uses, NetMedGPT consistently outperforms all specialized baselines, achieving area under the precision-recall curve gains of between 2.2% and 26%. When evaluated on independent external datasets, NetMedGPT outperformed baseline on an expert-curated clinical indications set and also preferentially prioritized clinically relevant drug-disease pairs in ClinicalTrials.gov. NetMedGPT's generative capability further supports the construction of mechanistically plausible subnetworks offering biological insights. NetMedGPT provides a unified foundation model for network medicine that supports scalable hypothesis generation and provides potential to accelerate drug repurposing. We further provided an interactive interface (https://prototypes.cosy.bio/chatnetmedgpt/) that allows users to obtain model inferences through natural-language queries.</p>
