<h2 class="paper-title">DynaBiomeX: An Interpretable Dual-Strategy Deep Learning Framework for Architectural Noise Filtration in Sparse Longitudinal Microbiome Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qureshi, A., Wahid, A., +1 author, Shahzad, M. K. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Longitudinal biomedical datasets, particularly high-resolution microbiome profiles, present unique and complex challenges arising from their extreme sparsity, prevalence of zero inflation, and inherently dynamic, nonstationary behavior. Conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) frequently encounter difficulties in these contexts, as they are unable to reliably differentiate between structural zeros and sampling zeros. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaBiomeX, a methodological framework specifically developed to model temporal dependencies within sparse biomedical timeseries data, while maintaining clinical interpretability. The DynaBiomeX framework integrates three parallel architectures BiDirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Attention based Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and an adapted Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) within a unified dual strategy Clinical Decision Support (CDS) workflow. These models are combined using stacking ensembles, which serve to maximize screening sensitivity by optimizing collective decision boundaries and thereby reducing the likelihood of missed cases. Concurrently, the adapted TFT functions as a specialized Sentinel, enhanced with Gated Residual Networks (GRN), to actively filter out stochastic noise and robustly validate predictions. This design helps the model separate real biological signals from random sampling noise. We tested on a multi modal dataset from 1,871 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients to detect gut dysbiosis. Our benchmarks comparisons reveal that the model architectures exhibit distinct functional differences. Stacking ensembles achieved the best discriminative performance ROCAUC = 0.912, making them well suited for risk screening. In contrast, the noise filtering TFT reached perfect precision with no false positives Precision = 1.0 and strong reliability (MCC = 0.646; p 0.81. DynaBiomeX couples sensitive ensemble screening with precise transformer validation to robustly analyze sparse longitudinal data. Validated on microbiome dysbiosis, this framework offers a template for zero inflated domains like single cell sequencing and EHR monitoring.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Graph neural network-based prediction of direct reprogramming factors using gene regulatory networks with microRNA-mediated regulation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kawasaki, R., Takemoto, K., Hamano, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Direct reprogramming (DR) converts somatic cells directly into target cell types while bypassing an intermediate pluripotent state, such as induced pluripotent stem cells. In practice, DR is achieved by transfecting multiple transcription factors (TFs); prior research has shown that combining microRNAs (miRNAs) with TFs further improves reprogramming efficiency. However, experimentally identifying effective TFs and miRNA combinations is difficult and costly, underscoring the need for robust in silico prediction approaches. We developed a graph neural network-based method to predict TFs that induce DR across diverse human cell types while explicitly modeling miRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation. By constructing a gene regulatory network integrating TF-target gene, TF-miRNA, miRNA-target gene, and gene-gene interactions, we implemented a Graph Attention Network v2 that predicts DR-inducing TFs while learning interaction importance and capturing transcriptional activation and repression. This approach outperformed existing methods in predicting experimentally validated DR-inducing TFs. Moreover, high-ranking predictions for previously unexplored tissues included TFs known to be associated with the development of the corresponding tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the results. Overall, the proposed method provides a practical in regenerative medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transcriptomic evaluation of immune-infiltrated patient-derived tumor organoids as preclinical models in renal cell carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yin, L., Lugand, L., +2 authors, Battail, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) have emerged as valuable preclinical models for studying tumor biology and therapeutic responses. However, despite the development of protocols for tumor dissociation and immune cell infiltration, their fidelity in representing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors remains poorly characterized. To address this, we established matched samples, including tumor tissue, enzymatically dissociated tumor, formed PDTOs, and immune-infiltrated PDTOs from three ccRCC patients, and performed bulk RNA sequencing to capture dynamic molecular changes across the experimental workflow. Our analyses revealed that tumor dissociation triggered stress-related transcriptional changes, marked by the upregulation of heat shock genes (e.g., HSPA1A) and the downregulation of the hypoxia pathway, while PDTOs recapitulated hypoxic signaling. Immune-infiltrated PDTOs retained critical immune signatures including T-effector, and exhibited an enhanced pro-inflammatory phenotype (CXCL10, JAK-STAT). Furthermore, predictive gene signatures and immunotherapy response scores further underscored the clinical relevance of immune-infiltrated PDTOs consistent with the original tumor tissue. Collectively, these findings validate immune-infiltrated PDTOs as robust, patient-specific models for personalized therapeutic exploration, offering a platform to optimize immunotherapy strategies in ccRCC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Semantic-Guided Spatial Representation Learning for Spatial Domain Identification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, Y., Xu, Y., +1 author, Zhang, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Spatial domain identification is a fundamental task in spatial transcriptomics analysis, aiming to partition tissue sections into coherent regions that reflect underlying biological organization. Most existing methods rely on gene expression similarity and spatial proximity, which can be insufficient when expression measurements are sparse, noisy, or weakly discriminative. In such settings, representation learning faces ambiguity in determining how spatial neighborhood information and expression-based similarity should be jointly utilized. Results: We present GreS, a spatial domain identification framework that incorporates gene-level semantic priors into spatial representation learning. GreS models spatial adjacency and expression-driven similarity using two complementary neighborhood graphs and leverages aggregated gene semantic information to guide how these views are weighted at the spot level. Rather than redefining neighborhood relationships, semantic priors act as contextual signals that modulate the relative contribution of spatial and expression-based cues during domain inference. We evaluate GreS on diverse spatial transcriptomics datasets, including layered brain tissue, embryonic development, and heterogeneous tumor microenvironments. Across these settings, GreS consistently identifies spatial domains that are structurally coherent and biologically interpretable, outperforming existing methods in quantitative accuracy and qualitative spatial organization. Our ablation analyses further demonstrate that performance gains arise from biologically meaningful and properly aligned semantic information, rather than from increased model complexity or auxiliary features.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MolSpecFlow: Mass-Constrained Hybrid Flow Matching for Joint Molecular-Spectral Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, Y., Yang, F., +8 authors, Yao, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying the ``dark matter" of the chemical universe requires bridging the fundamental gap between molecules and mass spectra. Existing approaches struggle to accurately map between these distinct data formats, often yielding results that are either chemically implausible or inconsistent with the physical evidence. We introduce MolSpecFlow, a unified foundation model pre-trained on 100 million molecules and 42 million spectra, which leverages a hybrid flow matching framework to orchestrate optimal transport paths for spectral peaks and discrete probability flows for molecular tokens. Furthermore, to guarantee the physicochemical validity of the generated structures, we incorporate explicit rule-based constraints into the generative process, utilizing a token-level mass control mechanism that strictly enforces alignment with the precursor molecular weight. MolSpecFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art on the MassSpecGym benchmark, surpassing diffusion and retrieval baselines in de novo generation (Top-1 accuracy +35%), spectral simulation, and molecular retrieval, demonstrating the power of physics-grounded unified modeling.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Topological reprogramming transforms an integral membrane oligosaccharyltransferase into a water-soluble glycosylation catalyst</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kwon, Y. H., Mihaljevic, L., +14 authors, DeLisa, M. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the formation of new glycosidic bonds and thus are vital for synthesizing nature's vast repertoire of glycans and glycoconjugates and for engineering glycan-related medicines and materials. However, obtaining detailed structural and functional insights for the &gt;750,000 known GTs is limited by difficulties associated with their efficient recombinant expression. Members of the GT-C fold, in particular, pose the most significant expression challenges due to the integration and folding requirements of their multiple membrane-spanning regions. Here, we address this challenge by engineering water-soluble variants of an archetypal GT-C fold enzyme, namely the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB from Campylobacter jejuni (CjPglB), which possesses 13 hydrophobic transmembrane helices. To render CjPglB water-soluble, we leveraged two advanced protein engineering methods: one that is universal called SIMPLEx (solubilization of IMPs with high levels of expression) and the other that is custom tailored called WRAPs (water-soluble RFdiffused amphipathic proteins). Each approach was able to transform CjPglB into a water-soluble enzyme that could be readily expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli cells at yields in the 3-6 mg/L range. Importantly, solubilization was achieved without the need for detergents and with retention of catalytic function. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that both SIMPLEx and WRAPs are promising platforms for advancing the molecular characterization of even the most structurally complex GTs, while also enabling broader GT-mediated glycosylation capabilities within synthetic glycobiology applications.</p>
