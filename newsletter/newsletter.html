<h2 class="paper-title">On the rise of AI technologies for virtual screening</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cecchini, M., Sinenka, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> AI foundational models for predicting protein-ligand interactions and binding affinities have started to emerge. We challenged Boltz-2 on a difficult dataset constructed on ten ultra-large virtual screening hit lists of pharmacologically relevant targets with in vitro binding assays. We show that Boltz-2 is the best classifier, with a success rate twice that of any other rescoring strategy. Ligand classifications by Boltz-2 are straightforward, accurate, efficient and robust, opening to million-compound accurate rankings on commodity resources.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Automating the Construction of Contextualized Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Scientific Inference</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zheng, Y., Liu, W., +4 authors, Li, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical interactions are inherently dynamic, often shifting or even reversing under specific physiological states. However, existing extraction methods simplify these complex mechanisms into context-agnostic binary associations, resulting in semantic loss and contradictory evidence. Here, we present AutoBioKG, an end-to-end framework that constructs context-aware knowledge graphs by leveraging composite triplets to encode environmental conditions and entity attributes alongside core relationships. Powered by a self-evolving open information extraction model trained solely on our curated BioOpenIE dataset, the framework refines its generalization capabilities. Notably, AutoBioKG surpasses state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot settings, achieving F1 score improvements ranging from 18.5% to 20.7% across three benchmarks (DDI, ChemProt, and BioRED). Furthermore, AutoBioKG-derived graphs significantly outperform existing approaches in the BioASQ biomedical question-answering task, particularly for complex queries requiring fine-grained contextual information. AutoBioKG offers a scalable and accessible solution for transforming unstructured literature into actionable biomedical knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A supervised ontology-aware cell annotation method forsingle-cell transcriptomic data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Magre, N., Alshehri, E., +4 authors, Fleming, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many single-cell RNA-seq annotation methods ignore the hierarchical nature of cell type classification. We present a probability propagation strategy that enforces ontological consistency and improves performance when applied to existing models without retraining. Combined with a lightweight logistic regression model trained on 42 million human cells, this yields SOCAM, a fast and interpretable classifier. We also introduce a hop-based F1 score for ontology-aware evaluation. Code and models are available open source.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Drummer, F. K., Jaekel, S., +4 authors, Theis, F. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oligodendrocyte dysfunction and heterogeneity are emerging as key contributors to Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, though cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing across three cortical regions from the same individuals, we identified region- and disease-specific transcriptomic changes, including increased mitochondrial genes and loss of cell type signatures. These results highlight the importance of biologically-informed quality control and underscore the value of multi-regional analysis for understanding AD pathogenesis and progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unifying phylogenetic traversal and deep learning to guide tree exploration</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Collienne, L., Richman, H., +3 authors, Matsen, F. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning offers hope for more efficient phylogenetic inference methods. However, it has yet to have the transformative effect on phylogenetics that it has had in other fields. Here we present a novel approach that combines deep learning with concepts behind current successful phylogenetic algorithms. Specifically, we give the deep learning algorithm access to the output of a phylogenetic dynamic program on the sequence alignment, rather than the raw sequence alignment. The algorithm then learns features based on these phylogenetically processed versions of the sequence data, which provides information that could inform local tree search. For this paper, our goal is simple: predict for each edge in a tree whether it is in a maximum parsimony tree or not. Our model consists of a recurrent neural network that learns features while traversing the input tree, which are used to classify the edge. The model makes high-quality predictions for this NP-complete problem on simulated and empirical datasets for trees of various sizes, and we believe is a stepping stone towards efficient phylogenetic inference using deep learning.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Gao, R., Shiau, C.-K., +6 authors, Yu, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High throughput long-read single cell RNA sequencing allows for fusion gene discovery in thousands of cells in parallel, which is however constrained by the lack of robust computational tools. Here, we develop LongFUSE that employs the XOR logic operation and stringent filtering criteria for the accurate detection of cell-specific fusion genes and their splicing isoforms. LongFUSE outperforms existing tools in both simulation and real data, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantitative Full-length transcriptome analysis by nanopore sequencing with Error-Aware UMI mapping</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Q., Li, D., +3 authors, Lou, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Comprehensive transcriptome profiling is essential for understanding RNA diversity and regulation, yet accurate identification and quantification of full-length transcript isoforms remain challenging with short-read sequencing technologies. Nanopore sequencing enables direct sequencing of long cDNA molecules and thus offers a powerful solution for full-length transcriptome analysis, but its application to quantitative transcriptomics is limited by PCR amplification bias and the difficulty of unique molecular identifier (UMI) recognition under high sequencing error rates. Here, we developed UMImap, a dedicated pipeline for robust UMI identification, error correction, and deduplication in nanopore data. By integrating transcript-aware UMI correction with long-read isoform assembly, UMImap substantially improves UMI recognition accuracy compared with existing methods and effectively mitigates PCR-induced duplication bias. Using this framework, we identified tens of thousands of full-length transcript isoforms, including a large fraction of previously unannotated isoforms that are significantly longer than reference annotations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate the reliability of UMImap for transcript-level quantification. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of highly expressed novel isoforms revealed coherent and biologically meaningful patterns, including strong enrichment in RNA processing, splicing, and translation pathways. Our results establish UMImap as an effective solution for UMI-based quantification in nanopore full-length transcriptome sequencing and highlight the potential of long-read sequencing to simultaneously achieve accurate isoform discovery and expression analysis in complex transcriptomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Outlier Detection in Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Disease-Enriched Cytotoxic Immune Populations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gupta, D., Gupta, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables detailed analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but standard clustering approaches can miss rare cell populations with important disease relevance. We present an outlier-aware framework that complements clustering by identifying statistically unusual cells. Applied to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, this approach revealed strong disease-associated enrichment of outliers: 9.62% in moderate disease and 6.16% in severe disease, compared with 1.14% in healthy controls. These cells exhibited elevated cytotoxic marker expression (NKG7, GZMB, PRF1, GNLY; 2.0-2.9x enrichment) consistent with activated effector immune states, with replication across independent datasets. To verify that outliers were not low-quality cells, we confirmed superior QC metrics: outliers showed 68% more genes and 78% higher UMI counts than normal cells. Application to rheumatoid arthritis PBMCs showed modest enrichment (5.40% in RA vs. 4.66% in healthy), consistent with chronic inflammation. Comparison of four outlier detection algorithms identified Isolation Forest as the best-performing method. Subclustering revealed diverse functional states within outliers, including NK cytotoxic cells, activated T cells, and proliferating cells. Overall, outlier detection reveals rare, functionally distinct immune populations overlooked by conventional clustering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Single-Cell Metabolic Profiling in a Glioblastoma Co-culture Model Using AP-MALDI-based Mass Spectrometry Imaging</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kontrimaite, U., Wong, K. F. C., +3 authors, Kim, D.-H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mass spectrometry imaging enables spatially resolved, label-free detection of metabolites in tissue and culture systems, providing insight into their metabolic landscape and spatial distribution. However, conventional approaches often lack the spatial resolution and specificity needed to investigate metabolic heterogeneity at the single cell level, particularly in physiologically relevant models. Here, we present a single cell ambient mass spectrometry imaging platform, enabling direct chemical mapping of metabolites at 10 um resolution. This method integrates cell labelling, high resolution microscopy and APMALDI Orbitrap mass spectrometry imaging to achieve cell type specific metabolite profiling. To demonstrate its application, we applied this approach to glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive adult brain tumour characterised by cellular heterogeneity, metabolic adaptation, and infiltrative growth within the tumour microenvironment. A co culture model combining patient-derived glioblastoma invasive-margin cells with human cortical astrocytes was used to recapitulate the invasive niche. Distinct metabolic signatures emerged upon glioblastoma and astrocyte interaction, involving pathways related to nucleotide metabolism, phospholipid and sphingolipid turnover, and tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism. These findings suggest cell-type-specific metabolic activity and potential intercellular metabolic interplay. Overall, this workflow offers a broadly accessible and robust approach for investigating metabolic heterogeneity at cellular resolution, enabling insights into metabolic interactions of heterogenous cell types in both disease and non disease settings.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Ullern, H., Johannessen, J. A., +9 authors, Knaevelsrud, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal, dominant condition caused by Folliculin (FLCN) mutation and characterized by enhanced risk for kidney tumors. Previous studies have shown constitutive nuclear localization of the transcription factor TFEB and simultaneous hyperactivation of canonical MTORC1 signaling in the absence of FLCN. Here we assess the impact on autophagy under this situation of combined anabolic and catabolic activation. Using an established BHD patient-derived kidney cancer cell line, we confirmed that TFEB was permanently localized in the nucleus combined with an increase in canonical MTORC1 signaling, whereas bulk autophagy flux and LC3 lipidation was unaffected by FLCN status. However, we found that the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 accumulated in enlarged puncta in the absence of FLCN. Finally, we recapitulate these findings in a Norwegian cohort of BHD kidney tumor samples. Our results demonstrate SQSTM1/p62 accumulation as a hallmark of FLCN loss, although SQSTM1/p62 appeared dispensable for anchorage-independent growth.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular stiffness profoundly impacts cancer metastasis at multiple levels, but mechanisms that regulate cancer cells' stiffness remain poorly understood. Here, we identified potassium efflux and KCNMB1, an auxiliary subunit of the large conductance potassium efflux (BK) channels, as regulators of cellular stiffness downstream of myocardin related transcription factor A (MRTFA). In primary pericytes, KCNMB1 knockdown increased cellular stiffness, which is consistent with the role of potassium efflux in promoting relaxation during excitation-contraction coupling. In a striking contrast, however, KCNMB1 knockdown decreased cellular stiffness in cancer cells. Softer cancer cells were resistant to NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and the low KCNMB1 expression was associated with worse survival in breast cancer patients. Importantly, pharmacological activation of BK channels reduced metastatic burden in mice and improved lysis of cancer cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. These results highlight the unique ionic regulation of stiffness in cancer cells and point to BK channel agonism as a new therapeutic approach in cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mutant ASXL1 Drives Transcriptional Activation and Repression in Human Hematopoiesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hall, M. L., Quintal, A., +16 authors, Braun, T. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutations in the epigenetic regulator ASXL1 are common in myeloid malignancies and portend a near-universally poor prognosis. While multiple mechanisms for mutant ASXL1-dependent oncogenesis have been proposed, none have been functionally validated in the context of the human hematopoietic stem cell, where these mutations almost certainly arise. Here, we extensively characterized a CRISPR-engineered human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell model of ASXL1 mutations. In this context, mutant ASXL1 expression decreases differentiation, increases clonogenicity in serial replating experiments, and improves engraftment in immunodeficient mice. We also show that endogenous truncating mutations in ASXL1 drive protein stabilization and confirm that mutant ASXL1 is resistant to proteasomal degradation. At the transcriptional level, these phenotypes are driven by significant repression of the stressresponse genes and by increased expression of bromodomain and extra-terminal family protein targets. Using protein-interaction screens, genomic and functional approaches, we link the positive transcriptional changes in ASXL1-mutant cells to BRD4-dependent RNA polymerase II pause release and identify a mechanism for transcriptional repression via a previously uncharacterized interaction with the transcription factor MECOM. Finally, we demonstrate that ASXL1-mutant AML exhibits increased MECOM activity consistent with our gene-editing models. Collectively, these studies highlight a highly reproducible model of mutant ASXL1 in the appropriate cell context. Further, they are the first to functionally describe the mutant ASXL1 interactome in the context of the human HSC, identifying new dependencies with therapeutic potential.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring structural diversity and dynamic stability of small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitors through machine learning-based QSAR and molecular modelling.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Abida Khan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a key epigenetic enzyme that catalyses symmetric arginine methylation on histone and non-histone proteins, influencing chromatin organisation, RNA splicing, and oncogenic signalling. Its overexpression and dependency in MTAP-deleted cancers such as glioblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma highlight its therapeutic relevance. This study presents an integrative computational framework combining quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and network pharmacology to identify potential PRMT5 inhibitors. The best QSAR models based on machine learning techniques used different fingerprint representations and algorithms to describe chemical structures; Random Forest models trained on PubChem and MACCS descriptor combinations provided the most accurate predictions. Analysis of consensus QSAR models identified two highly active PRMT5 inhibitor candidates (CHEMBL4539612 and CHEMBL4577464), with high affinity for binding (- 13.5 to - 13.7 kcal/mol) to the PRMT5 active site and interactions similar to those of the known clinical PRMT5 inhibitor ONAMETOSTAT. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that both candidate molecules-maintained stability throughout the PRMT5 catalytic cleft, due to consistent hydrogen bonding, compact conformations, and low negative binding free energy values determined by MM-GBSA calculations. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that PRMT5 and its interacting partners are mainly associated with histone arginine methylation and spliceosomal assembly, processes that are frequently dysregulated in MTAP-deficient cancers. These findings suggest CHEMBL4539612 and CHEMBL4577464 as promising scaffolds for the development of selective PRMT5 inhibitors in epigenetic cancer therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SpatialFusion: A Unified Model for Integrating Spatial Transcriptomics to Unveil Cell-type Distribution, Interaction, and Functional Heterogeneity in Tissue Microenvironments.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mengqiu Wang, Zhiwei Zhang, +6 authors, Qianjin Guo</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have significantly enhanced our understanding of tissue structure and intercellular interactions. However, existing methods for spatial domain identification and cell type deconvolution still face challenges related to accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialFusion, an innovative deep learning model designed to improve both spatial domain identification and cell type deconvolution by integrating gene expression and spatial coordinates. The core innovation of SpatialFusion lies in its use of graph neural networks (GNN) and attention mechanisms to capture complex spatial relationships through multi-dimensional embeddings of spatial data. By employing a dual-encoding strategy (co-learning of spatial graphs and feature maps) and self-supervised contrastive learning, the model significantly enhances accuracy and robustness across datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SpatialFusion outperforms existing methods in accuracy and resolution when applied to the human DLPFC dataset, particularly in capturing complex, layer-specific expression patterns. The model also shows strong robustness in cell type deconvolution, accurately mapping spatial cell type distributions despite noise and low cell density. In breast cancer tumor microenvironment analysis, SpatialFusion revealed spatial heterogeneity and identified potential therapeutic targets, COX6C and CCND1, providing valuable insights for precision medicine.</p>
