<h2 class="paper-title">CPLfold: Chimeric and Pseudoknot-capable almost Linear-time RNA Secondary Structure Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, K., Kudla, G., Cohen, S. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: RNA structure plays a central role in how transcripts function, but inferring it reliably remains difficult, especially when pseudoknots need to be part of the prediction. Chemical probing experiments provide additional signals, yet these signals do not directly identify base pairing partners. RNA proximity ligation provides direct evidence of base pairing, but balancing this evidence with pseudoknot prediction accuracy and scalability of structure prediction for long sequences remains challenging. Results: We present CPLfold, a fast and flexible RNA folding method that combines thermodynamic modeling with chimeric evidence from RNA cross-linking and ligation experiments, while naturally supporting pseudoknots. CPLfold scales to long sequences and recovers more accurate global structures and long-range interactions than existing approaches across multiple benchmarks such as COMRADES and IRIS. By tuning two simple trade-off parameters (, {beta}) the method allows flexibility in the level of incorporating chimeric evidence and asserting pseudoknots. Availability and Implementation: Source code and scripts are available at https://github.com/Vicky-0256/CPLfold.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Discovery of TDP-43 aggregation inhibitors via a hybrid machine learning framework</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kapsiani, S., Vora, S., +3 authors, Kaminski Schierle, G. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Recent therapeutic efforts have highlighted the potential of small molecules capable of inhibiting TDP-43 aggregation; however, no effective treatments currently exist. Here, we developed a hybrid machine learning approach combining graph neural network (GNN) embeddings with traditional chemical descriptors and biological target annotations. Using XGBoost as the final classifier enabled model interpretability through SHAP analysis, allowing the identification of key chemical features and target annotations associated with TDP-43 anti-aggregation activity. Complementary Monte Carlo Tree Search analysis highlighted specific chemical substructures linked to predicted activity. By screening an external library of 3,853 small molecules, the model identified two compounds not previously evaluated against TDP-43 aggregation, namely berberrubine and PE859. Molecular docking analysis revealed that both compounds interact favourably with the TDP-43 RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain through distinct binding modes. Experimental validation showed that both compounds significantly reduced TDP-43 aggregation in HEK cells. Further testing in Caenorhabditis elegans expressing human TDP-43 demonstrated that PE859 significantly rescued locomotor defects, while berberrubine showed partial improvement. This work establishes a hybrid machine learning approach for accelerating small molecule drug discovery, yielding two promising therapeutic candidates for TDP-43 proteinopathies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CodonRL: Multi-Objective Codon Sequence Optimization Using Demonstration-Guided Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Du, S., Kaynar, G., +3 authors, Kingsford, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Optimizing synonymous codon sequences to improve translation efficiency, RNA stability, and compositional properties is challenging because the search space grows exponentially with protein length and objectives interact through long range RNA structure. Dynamic programming-based methods can provide strong solutions for fixed objective combinations but are difficult to extend to additional constraints. Deep generative models require large-scale, high-quality mRNA sequence datasets for training, limiting applicability when such data are scarce. Reinforcement learning naturally handles sequential decision-making but faces challenges in codon optimization due to delayed rewards, large action spaces, and expensive structural evaluation. We present CodonRL, a reinforcement learning framework that learns a structural prior for mRNA design from efficient folding feedback and demonstration-guided replay, and then enables user-controlled multi-objective trade-offs during inference. CodonRL uses LinearFold for fast intermediate reward computation during training and ViennaRNA for final evaluation, warms up learning with expert sequences to accelerate convergence for global structure objectives, and introduces milestone-based intermediate rewards to address delayed feedback in long range optimization. On a benchmark of 55 human proteins, CodonRL outperforms GEMORNA, a state-of-the-art codon optimization method, across multiple metrics, achieving 9.5% higher codon adaptation index (CAI), 25.4 kcal/mol more favorable minimum free energy (MFE), and 3.4% lower uridine content on average, while improving codon stabilization coefficient (CSC) in over 90% of benchmark proteins under matched constraints. These gains translate into designs that are predicted to be more efficiently translated, more structurally stable, and less immunogenic, while supporting continuous objective reweighting at inference time.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Quispe Rojas, W., de Diego Fuertes, M., Rennie, V., +2 authors, Van Rie, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bedaquiline resistance is emerging globally and threatens the effectiveness of the novel short all-oral regimens for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Following a systematic literature review, we quantified 13 sequence, biochemical, and structural features of 62 Rv0678 missense variants reported in 136 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Using rigorous machine learning methods, we show that the strongest contributing features were the evolutionary conservation score and the shortest atomic distance to key functional sites. The final 5-feature model had good performance (ROC-AUC 0.826) and classified the bedaquiline phenotype with high accuracy [sensitivity 87.1% (95% CI, 78.3-92.6) and specificity 88.2% (95% CI, 76.6-94.5)]. Performance was lower in external validation, likely due to the measurement error introduced when using diverse phenotypic methods. missense variants on the mmpR5 protein structure and function. Integrating the five-feature in-silico in variant interpretation software could improve the prediction of the effect of Rv0678 variants and guide clinical management of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Analysis of Age-Specific Dysregulation of miRNAs in Lung Cancer Via Machine learning: Biomarker Identification and Therapeutic Implications in Patients Aged 60 and Above.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hasan, A., Muzaffar, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, predominantly affects older individuals, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprising 85% of cases. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, prognosis for elderly patients remains poor. This study investigates the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in lung cancer, focusing on individuals aged 60 and above. RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to conduct differential expression analysis of miRNA profiles from elderly and senile patient groups. Results showed that out of 1,881 miRNA profiles, 801 were found to be differentially expressed. Filtering for significance identified that 25 miRNAs, with hsa-mir-1911 upregulated and 24, including hsa-mir-196a and hsa-mir-323b found to be downregulated. Studies showed that these miRNAs play roles in apoptosis, senescence, and inflammation. Another Experimental approach in this study, used Machine learning analysis which highlighted key miRNAs, including hsa-mir-181b, hsa-mir-542, hsa-mir-450b, hsa-mir-584, and hsa-mir-21 as crucial in lung cancer biology. Moreover, Functional enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in gene silencing, translational repression, and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) regulation. This research identifies the association of miRNAs and aging in lung cancer and finds potential biomarkers that can be helpful in early diagnosis and targets for personalized therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TOXsiRNA: A web server to predict the toxicity of chemically modified siRNAs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dar, S., Kumar, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are largely modified with chemical molecules to enhance their properties for use in molecular biology research and therapeutic applications. Toxicity effects may arise due to these chemical moieties as well as sequence based off-targets at cellular level. Enormous resources are required to experimentally design and test the toxicity of these chemical modifications and their combinations on siRNAs. To address this problem, we developed TOXsiRNA web server to computationally predict the toxicity of chemically modified siRNAs and their off-targets. We selected 2749 siRNAs with different permutations and combinations of 21 different chemical modifications engineered on them. Next, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning applications to develop models. Best performance was displayed by mononucleotide composition based model developed with SVM, offering Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.91 and 0.92 on training testing and independent validations respectively. Other sequence features like dinucleotide composition binary pattern and their combinations were also tested. Finally, three models of chemically modified siRNAs were implemented on the web server. Other algorithms that include predicting normal as well as chemically modified siRNA knockdown efficacy, off target etc. are also integrated.

<h2 class="paper-title">evoCancerGPT: Generating Zero-Shot Single-Cell and Single-Sample Cancer Progression Through Transfer Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, X., Tan, R., Cristea, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer evolution is driven by complex changes in gene expression as cells transition and change states during tumorigenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing has provided snapshot insights into how the transcriptomics of tumors evolve, but whether the existing knowledge can be used to reliably learn and generate the patterns behind the evolution of cancers remains unknown. Here, we introduce evoCancerGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer decoder-only single-cell foundation model designed to forecast future gene expression profiles in cancer evolution by leveraging previous cell states at the level of single patients. This model integrates the continuous gene expression data of each cell to create a comprehensive representation of a cell token. Training sentences are constructed for each cancer type, each patient and each cell type separately, ordered via inferred pseudotime algorithms, using 2.76 million cell tokens, each with 12,639 genes, spanning 7 cancer types. By learning from long-range dependencies between cells arranged in pseudotime from a large corpus of data, evoCancerGPT captures key transitions in cancer evolution, achieving high concordance to ground truth trajectories and outperforming linear and scGPT baselines in held-out test samples in low-context scenarios. Our work suggests evoCancerGPT's potential utility in characterizing tumor progression at a single-cell and single-patient level and ultimately contributing to more personalized cancer care.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MassID provides near complete annotation of metabolomics data with identification probabilities</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Stancliffe, E., Gandhi, M., +6 authors, Patti, G. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is a powerful tool in metabolomics research, generating tens-of-thousands of signals from a single biological sample. However, current software solutions for unbiased assessment of metabolomics data analysis are limited by complex sources of noise and non-quantitative metabolite identifications that make results difficult to interpret. Here, we present MassID, a cloud-based untargeted metabolomics pipeline that aims to overcome the innate challenges of unbiased metabolite analysis and perform end-to-end data processing, transforming raw spectra to normalized and identified metabolite profiles. MassID incorporates a suite of software functionalities, including deep learning-based peak detection and comprehensive noise filtering. In addition, with MassID we introduce a novel software module: DecoID2 that enables probabilistic metabolite identification for false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled metabolomics. When applied to a human plasma dataset, MassID results in near-complete signal annotation, identification of &gt;4,000 metabolites (including &gt;1,200 compounds at an FDR &lt;5%) across four complementary LC/MS runs, and enables integrated downstream analyses to understand biochemical dysregulation at both the molecular and pathway level. When compared to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) confidence levels, identification probability generally correlated with MSI levels. However, only 356/418 of MSI Level 1 compounds were identified with &lt;5% FDR and the remaining 884 FDR &lt; 5% compounds were identified from MSI L2-L3 compounds, highlighting the enhanced specificity and discovery potential achieved by MassID.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Epigenetic activation of CHST2 by promoter hypomethylation promotes progression of triple-negative breast cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qu, S., Li, K., +4 authors, Song, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), yet the oncogenic relevance of specific epigenetically activated genes remains poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that carbohydrate sulfotransferase 2 (CHST2) is aberrantly upregulated in TNBC across multiple transcriptomic analyses as a consequence of promoter hypomethylation. Elevated CHST2 expression is associated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and has been linked to unfavorable patient outcomes in independent cohorts. Functional analyses reveal that CHST2 primarily promotes TNBC cell migration and invasion, while genetic silencing of CHST2 markedly attenuates these malignant phenotypes. Importantly, mutational disruption of CHST2 catalytic activity abolishes its pro-migratory effects, indicating that sulfotransferase activity is essential for CHST2-driven invasiveness. Mechanistically, promoter hypomethylation is experimentally supported as a driver of CHST2 transcriptional activation, linking epigenetic deregulation to enhanced tumor aggressiveness. In addition, tumors with high CHST2 expression exhibit distinct immune-related transcriptional features within the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, these findings identify CHST2 as an epigenetically activated driver of invasive behavior in TNBC and highlight its potential value as a biomarker and therapeutic target for aggressive disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rational scaffold design mitigates mitochondrial complex I off-target inhibition in bifunctional degraders</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Richert, N., Nuskova, H., +9 authors, Miller, A. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemical inducers of proximity have transformed small-molecule pharmacology, but the large, bifunctional architectures they often employ introduce new and poorly understood off-target risks. During a targeted protein degrader synthesis project, we identified a subset of compounds that cause rapid and unexpected ATP depletion in cells. Mechanistic studies traced this effect to inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, a central component of oxidative phosphorylation. This inhibition does not stem from off-target binding by either of the two target ligands, but from the global molecular shape of the bifunctional molecules. Systematic truncation and modification revealed that long, linear molecular architectures enable effective occupancy of the hydrophobic ubiquinone-binding tunnel of mitochondrial complex I. Strikingly, this liability extends to structurally unrelated bifunctional molecules, including clinical candidates such as the androgen receptor degrader ARV-110, which inhibits mitochondrial complex I with nanomolar potency. In a proof-of-concept study, we redesigned the ARV-110 scaffold to mitigate mitochondrial liability. Disruption of linear molecular geometry through the introduction of structural bumps or kinks abolished mitochondrial complex I inhibition while preserving degrader potency, revealing a generalizable strategy for targeted protein degraders. These findings uncover a previously underappreciated structural determinant of off-target mitochondrial toxicity and establish new design principles for safer proximity-inducing therapeutics.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Camacho, L. Q., Fallahi-Sichani, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epigenetic dysregulation is a common feature of cancer and creates selective vulnerabilities arising from an increased reliance on chromatin-based mechanisms that sustain malignant transcriptional states. While many chromatin regulators are broadly required for cellular viability, others function in a context-dependent manner across distinct oncogenic settings, tissue lineages, and differentiation states. Moreover, chromatin regulators often operate within multi-subunit complexes, thus epigenetic vulnerabilities emerge from coordinated complex activities rather than single genes. Here, we integrate large-scale genetic dependency maps from human cancer cell lines with curated epigenetic complex annotations to perform a systematic, multivariate analysis of complex-level epigenetic dependencies across cancer lineages. Our analysis reveals that dependencies frequently cluster among functionally related chromatin complexes and that biologically related cancer types share similar dependency patterns, consistent with shared underlying epigenetic requirements. Focusing on melanoma, we identify multiple enriched epigenetic complex dependencies, including complexes previously associated with recurrent genetic alterations or melanocyte lineage regulation, as well as a previously unrecognized vulnerability involving the H3K4 methyltransferase complex Set1C/COMPASS. This dependency is not restricted to a specific melanoma differentiation state, but genetic perturbation of CXXC1 (a complex-specific subunit) demonstrates that sensitive melanoma cell lines require Set1C/COMPASS activity to maintain global H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and cellular proliferation. Single-cell analysis further shows that loss of H3K4me3 following CXXC1 depletion is coupled to cell-cycle blockade. Integrative modeling links Set1C/COMPASS dependency to MYC- and E2F-driven transcriptional programs, which are suppressed upon complex inhibition. Together, this work combines integrative, complex-level multivariate analysis of lineage-enriched epigenetic dependencies with genetic perturbation, transcriptional profiling and single-cell analysis to uncover an enriched epigenetic vulnerability in melanoma cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Coexistent PTEN and PIK3CA alterations hyperactivate mTORC1 signaling in endometrial cancers and cause their selective sensitivity to mTORC1 inhibition</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Solomon, H., Mukherjee, R., +13 authors, Rosen, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In approximately half of endometrial carcinoma (EC), PTEN loss-of-function and activating PI3K mutants coexist. Unlike cells with either single mutation, PTEN/PIK3CA coexistent alterations result in elevated membrane phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels and mTORC1 hyperactivation, rendering PI3K or AKT inhibition ineffective in blocking mTORC1 activity and tumor growth. The bi-steric mTORC1 kinase inhibitor, RMC-6272, suppresses mTORC1 activity and cell growth by reducing protein translation and cell cycle progression. In vivo, RMC-6272, but not PI3K inhibitors, effectively suppressed mTORC1 and growth of EC PDXs with coexistent PTEN/PIK3CA lesions. These findings are consistent with a phase I trial of bi-steric mTORC1 inhibitor RMC-5552, showing anti-tumor activity in patients with EC. PDXs with KRAS co-mutations regrew after RMC-6272 treatment, which was prevented by the addition of the RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor RMC-7977. Overall, these data suggest that mTORC1 hyperactivation drives ECs with coexistent PTEN/PIK3CA mutations, explain the limited antitumor activity of PI3K and AKT inhibitors, and support clinical evaluation of mTORC1 inhibitors as potential therapy for EC.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Bandi, D. S. R., Nagaraju, P., +18 authors, El-Rayes, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) was previously reported to be overexpressed in various cancers and essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Here, we studied a novel PDE10 inhibitor, ADT-030, and found it to potently and selectively inhibit KRAS mutant PDAC cell proliferation and clonogenicity by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis. ADT-030 also inhibited motility of PDAC cells in vitro. These effects were mediated by increased cAMP/cGMP levels and activation of PKA/PKG. The growth inhibitory activity of ADT-030 was associated with reduced {beta}-catenin and RAS signaling. Notably, ADT-030 also inhibited the growth of KRASG12D and KRASG12C mutant PDAC cells resistant to allele-specific KRAS inhibitors. Oral administration of ADT-030 significantly suppressed tumor growth, reduced lung and liver metastasis, and increased survival without systemic toxicity in syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) PDAC models. ADT-030 also increased chemotherapy response in orthotopic PDAC models. Immune phenotyping and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed remodeling of the tumor microenvironment by ADT-030 with a more favorable immune suppressive profile to activate anti-tumor immunity. These results show that ADT-030 is a promising drug development candidate for the treatment of KRAS-mutant PDAC capable of simultaneously targeting key oncogenic signaling pathways, resulting in tumor-intrinsic and immunomodulatory effects.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A single-cell atlas and aging clock define biological age and risk-associated stem cell states in human hematopoiesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, H., Dong, P., +1 author, Wang, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aging of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) impairs regenerative capacity and predisposes to hematological diseases. Here, we constructed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas comprising 186,123 CD34+ HSPCs spanning early prenatal development (6 post-conception weeks) to late adulthood (74 years). We identified six molecular programs (MPs) that define distinct functional states within the HSC/multipotent progenitor (MPP) compartment. Among these, MP1, associated with inflammaging, and MP5, related to RNA splicing and protein homeostasis, exhibited conserved age-associated dynamics across independent datasets, highlighting their central roles in stem cell aging. Leveraging these age-associated programs, we developed a machine learning-based stem cell aging clock from 84 donors to predict chronological age from HSC/MPP transcriptomes. Applying this aging clock to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) defines transcriptional age deviation (TAD), a measure of biological age divergence in leukemic HSC/MPPs. TAD captures disease-associated variation linked to genetic risk stratification and patient survival. Our study provides a high-resolution reference map of human HSPC aging, establishes a stem cell-specific aging clock and demonstrates its utility for uncovering aging-related dysregulation with prognostic relevance in hematological malignancies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ChatDIA: A zero-shot large language model workflow for targeted analysis of data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, J., Charkow, J., +2 authors, Rost, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics enables reproducible, large-scale protein identification and quantification but remains challenging to analyze due to highly complex MS/MS spectra and chromatographic interference, particularly in low signal-to-noise single-cell proteomics. Here, we introduce ChatDIA, a zero-shot large language model (LLM)-based workflow for targeted DIA analysis that operates through an explicit reasoning-based decision framework. ChatDIA performs automated peptide identification and supports natural-language interaction with DIA data. Unlike purpose-built DIA software that relies on domain-specific models, ChatDIA employs general-purpose LLMs in a zero-shot setting to reason directly over extracted ion chromatograms and generate human-interpretable rationales for each decision. On an expert-annotated Streptococcus pyogenes DIA benchmark dataset, ChatDIA achieved 96.9% accuracy, matching the domain-specific state-of-the-art software DIA-NN (95.5%). In a challenging single-cell HEK-293T DIA proteomics dataset, ChatDIA further demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a lower risk-coverage area under the curve than DIA-NN (0.06 vs. 0.12) and identifying 17.5% and 45.25% of library peptides at 1% and 5% false discovery rate, respectively, compared with 16.25% and 48% for DIA-NN. Together, these results demonstrate that zero-shot LLM reasoning can competitively automate core targeted DIA decision-making while providing transparent, inspectable rationales that enable conversational, interactive validation and data exploration in noisy proteomics applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transformer-based feature extraction approach for hematopoietic cancer subtype classification.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kwang Ho Park, Younghee Lee, +2 authors, Keun Ho Ryu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate classification of hematopoietic cancer subtypes remains challenging due to the multipotent nature of hematopoietic cells and the absence of definitive genetic markers. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based Autoencoder that captures compact and biologically informative embeddings from gene expression data. Specifically, our method employs multi-head self-attention in the encoder to learn complex nonlinear interactions among genes, with a reconstruction decoder that enforces biological feature retention. We benchmarked our approach against four widely-used feature extraction methods-Principal Component Analysis, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Autoencoder, and Variational Autoencoder-using transcriptomic data from five hematopoietic cancer subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas, totaling 2452 samples. Data were split 60:20:20 into training, validation, and test sets with stratification, and feature-extractor hyperparameters were chosen on the validation set. Each method produced 100-dimensional feature vectors, subsequently evaluated using eight multi-class classifiers: Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks. On the independent test set, the Transformer-based Autoencoder embeddings combined with Light Gradient Boosting Machine achieved F1-score: 0.969, accuracy: 0.986, precision: 0.975, recall: 0.964, specificity: 0.996, G-mean: 0.980, and balanced accuracy: 0.954. For context, we additionally included a supervised tabular Transformer (FT-Transformer) as a reference; while strong, it is not directly comparable to our unsupervised feature extractor. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we applied Shapley Additive exPlanations to identify the twenty most influential genes contributing to subtype discrimination. This analysis revealed key biomarkers related to endoplasmic reticulum function, antigen processing, and ribonucleic acid regulation. These findings demonstrate that transformer-based unsupervised feature extraction substantially improves predictive accuracy and yields valuable biological insights for complex hematologic malignancies. Overall, the study supports attention-driven representation learning for tabular biomedical data and motivates future work in generative/self-supervised representations for gene expression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Network toxicology and multi-omics analyses identify diagnostic genes and elucidate underlying mechanisms of 6PPDQ-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xulei Zuo, Xiaoyu Hou, +5 authors, Juan Zhang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the rapid expansion of tire production, the antioxidant N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) and its transformation product, 6PPD-quinone (6PPDQ), have emerged as widespread environmental contaminants with demonstrated toxicity. Here, we employed an integrated network toxicology and computational framework to elucidate the mechanisms by which 6PPDQ may contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transcriptomic data from four GEO datasets were normalized and analyzed using differential expression analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), identifying 923 HCC-associated genes. Intersection with 3844 predicted 6PPDQ targets resulted in 148 candidate mediators. GO and KEGG analyses revealed enrichment in xenobiotic metabolism, redox regulation, and oncogenic pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt, TNF, p53). Subsequent machine learning analysis identified nine hub genes, among which CHST4, SLC26A6, LY6E, and FAM13A formed a robust diagnostic signature (AUC = 0.999; Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 1.0). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed their cell type-specific expression and associations with altered immune infiltration. Molecular docking and 100 ns dynamics simulations demonstrated stable high-affinity binding between 6PPDQ and CHST4 (ΔG = -9.1 kcal/mol). Finally, we constructed an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) linking 6PPDQ exposure to immune dysregulation and HCC initiation. This multi-omics and in silico study reveals a mechanistic network by which 6PPDQ promotes hepatic carcinogenesis, highlights four candidate biomarkers for early detection, and provides a conceptual AOP framework for future toxicological and therapeutic investigations.</p>
