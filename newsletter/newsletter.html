<h2 class="paper-title">Consensus Pituitary Atlas, a scalable resource for annotation, novel marker discovery and analyses in pituitary gland research</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Köver, B., Willis, T. L., +13 authors, Andoniadou, C. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous single-cell profiling studies of the pituitary gland have yielded minimally reproducible insights largely due to their low statistical power and methodological inconsistencies. To address this problem, we generated a uniformly pre-processed Consensus Pituitary Atlas (CPA) using all existing mouse pituitary single-cell datasets (267 biological replicates, &gt;1.1 million high-quality cells). The CPA revealed novel cell typing and lineage markers, including low-expression transcripts that previous analyses could not detect. The scale of the CPA enabled the development of machine learning models to automate and standardize cell type annotation and doublet identification for future studies. Leveraging the curated metadata, we identified sex-biased and age-dependent gene expression patterns at cell type resolution. To identify drivers of cell fates, first we determined consensus cell communication patterns. Secondly, we used RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to identify transcription factors associated with cell fates across modalities. The epitome platform acts as an interface with the CPA, allowing streamlined user-friendly analyses.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimized quantitative bacterial two-hybrid (qB2H) for protein-protein interaction assessment</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guyot, A., Maillard, E., +6 authors, Ramos, O. H. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding protein quaternary assemblies is essential for both biology and clinical applications. Insight into these assemblies can be gained by assessing how mutations alter their function. Massively parallel analyses of protein-protein interaction (PPI) variants enable the identification of interaction interfaces, key contact residues, and the generation of datasets suitable for machine learning-based approaches. In cellulo strategies, such as two-hybrid systems, provide straightforward access to such information. However, the reliability of the resulting insights critically depends on the quality of the underlying quantitative data. Here, we evaluated the quantitative properties of previously described bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) systems and found limitations that constrain their ability to generate robust datasets. Building on this analysis, we engineered and benchmarked optimized quantitative B2H (qB2H) alternatives. These systems support strain-independent assays, improve data reproducibility, and enable the generation of high-quality, quantitative datasets suitable for downstream applications. We show the utility of qB2H in two contexts: interface mapping and binder optimization. For interface mapping, perturbation analysis of single-site variants accurately recovered known contact positions within ASF1 complexes, in agreement with crystallographic data. For binder optimization, we show that a peptide binder of ASF1 can be improved by approximately 70-fold. Together, these results establish qB2H as a convenient and robust system for quantitative PPI characterization, providing a reliable framework for protein engineering and for generating datasets that can fuel machine learning-driven discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Adaptive evolution of engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae in favored and unusual chemical environments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kakko von Koch, N., Lohilahti, O., +3 authors, Jouhten, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Engineered microbial cells can produce a wide range of industrially relevant chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, fuels, and material precursors. The use of microbial cells for chemical production from renewable resources could replace oil-based chemistry and contribute to tackling global grand challenges of climate warming and resource insufficiency. However, it is underexplored how the chemical production by engineered microbial cells is affected by them being proliferating catalysts exposed to Darwinian selection. All proliferating cells are unavoidably subjected to Darwinian selection which favors fitness beneficial phenotypes that seldom include engineered chemical production. Here, adaptive laboratory evolution was performed to characterize the effect of Darwinian selection on Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing two different heterologous pigment producing pathways, blue-coloured indigoidine and red-coloured bikaverin. S. cerevisiae haploid S288C based strain had the genes for bikaverin synthesis integrated in the same locus as the genes for indigoidine synthesis in haploid and diploid S. cerevisiae CEN.PK-based strains. The two different pigment producing strains were cultivated in rich and synthetic defined (without amino acids) media with respirative galactose as the sole carbon source for ~200 and ~175 generations, respectively. While CEN.PK-based lineages rapidly lost indigoidine pigmentation independent of growth medium or ploidy, bikaverin pigmentation in S288C-based lineages was robust. The adaptive solutions detected in S288C-based bikaverin producing lineages involved mutations in the galactose utilization pathway whereas the heterologous indigoidine pathway was recurrently mutated in the corresponding lineages. When the bikaverin producing S288C-based lineages were adaptively evolved on the favored glucose carbon source instead, pigmentation declined. Thus, the robustness of the engineered traits appears dependent on challenges in production environment and availability and fitness benefits of adaptive solutions. Whether or when engineered traits of microbial cells are robust when they proliferate in industrial use has scarcely been assessed. Here light was shed to the factors affecting the adaptive loss of engineered traits to facilitate the development of strains and biotechnological processes, including chemical environments, for robust long-term production.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">In-Cell Synthesis of Nε-acetyl-L-lysine for Facile Protein Acetylation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhan, M., Zhang, Y., +6 authors, Wang, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> N{varepsilon}-acetylation of proteins is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) that occurs across all kingdoms of life and plays key roles in nearly every cellular process. Due to its broad significance, there is a strong demand for chemical biology tools that enable efficient, site-specific acetylation of target proteins in live cells. Genetic code expansion (GCE) has emerged as a powerful tool for introducing N{varepsilon}-acetylation at specific lysine residues in proteins. However, achieving adequate expression levels typically requires adding 2-10 mM of chemically synthesized N{varepsilon}-Acetyl-L-lysine (AcK) to the culture medium, which can be cumbersome and costly. To overcome this limitation, we present the first proof-of-concept for a one-pot acetylation platform that simplifies protein acetylation in both E. coli and mammalian cells. Our approach begins with the discovery of 10 novel lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) capable of biosynthesizing AcK from basic carbon sources. When these enzymes are co-expressed with the genetic incorporation machinery for AcK, they facilitate streamlined, site-specific acetylation of any target protein without compromising E. coli viability. This innovative platform not only broadens the range of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) that can be biosynthesized and incorporated but also provides a powerful tool for probing the histone and non-histone acetylation events in live cells. In addition, this technique offers an eco-friendly and scalable method to produce synthetic acetylated proteins, which will provide practical value in acetylation/deacetylation-related research such as chemical biology, biotechnology, and drug development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SwitchClass: dissecting attenuated and escalated molecular features via a label-switch classification framework</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xiao, D., Yang, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological systems exhibit complex molecular trajectories in response to perturbations, ranging from changes that revert or attenuate towards homeostasis to alterations that persist or escalate. Capturing these complex patterns is essential for understanding molecular resilience and maladaptive persistence. Here, we introduce SwitchClass, a label-switch classification framework that distinguishes attenuated and escalated molecular features across biological states. By training dual classifiers with inverted outcome labels, SwitchClass computes a differential feature importance score ({delta}) that quantifies directional change in high-dimensional data. Applied to colorectal cancer proteomics spanning healthy, pre-treatment, and post-treatment samples, SwitchClass reveals proteins that normalise after therapy and those remaining dysregulated, uncovering partial molecular recovery. In phosphoproteomics of dietary perturbation and reversal, it uncovers phosphorylation sites linked to incomplete restoration of insulin signalling. In single-cell transcriptomes from COVID-19 patients with varying severities, it identifies cell-type-specific transcripts that mark either the resolution or persistence of inflammatory activity. Together, these analyses establish SwitchClass as a generalisable and interpretable framework for mapping directional molecular changes underlying adaptation, divergence, and disease severity across biological systems.

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantum Deep Learning Pipeline for Next Generation Network Biology</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yazdi, M., Srinivas, K. R., Yadav, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose. Module discovery in omics networks is central to interpretation. Classical pipelines capture broad community structure, but exact search for small, connected, topology aware modules is combinatorial, making exhaustive solutions impractical at genome scale. Moreover, most quantum clique formulations to date optimize only maximal density on non biological graphs, which mismatches the heterogeneous shapes of real biological modules. Methods. We trained a symmetric 10-dimensional autoencoder on GTEx normals (Heart Left Ventricle; Muscle Skeletal; UCSC Xena Toil) to obtain tissue-specific latent representations. For each tissue we built a 10*10 latent-node correlation graph and formulated a QUBO that rewards strong edges and penalizes isolated selections (edge threshold {tau}=0.80). QAOA (depth=3, COBYLA) generated high-probability bitstrings, which we post-filtered to retain connected, non-overlapping subsets; decoder triggered gene sets and multi-library enrichment provided functional interpretation. Results. QAOA distilled the Heart graph to three dyads (2-node modules with strong-edge sums {approx}0.89/0.95), pairing conduction with mitochondria, conduction with ECM/adhesion, and two contractile nodes. In Muscle, QAOA returned one dominant 6-node module (edge-sum {approx}7.0) integrating contractile machinery, electrophysiology, mitochondrial metabolism, and translation; a weaker ECM leaning triplet was visible but fell below the top 10 threshold. Conclusion. QAOA based quantum optimization yields discrete, testable modules from latent correlations that match tissue programs. Despite a 10-node demo (current limits), the scale-agnostic design extends to 10^3 10^5 nodes and multi omics via hierarchical compression and hybrid search supporting quantum modeling for next generation network biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deciphering the Antigenic Evolution of Seasonal Influenza A Viruses with PREDAC-Transformer: From Antigenic Clustering to Key Site Identification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, J., Wang, J., +6 authors, Jiang, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seasonal influenza viruses undergo continuous antigenic drift due to mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, rendering vaccines ineffective and posing a significant global public health challenge. Existing computational models can predict antigenic relationships but generally lack interpretability, making it difficult to reveal the molecular determinants driving antigenic changes. To address this, we developed PREDAC-Transformer, an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates sequence, physicochemical, and evolutionary features, and employs a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies relevant to antigenicity. More importantly, we introduce the integrated antigenicity score, which combines attention-based attribution with information-theoretic metrics to provide continuous quantification and ranking of the antigenic contributions of individual amino acid site. Our results demonstrate that PREDAC-Transformer not only significantly improves the accuracy of antigenic relationship prediction but also successfully recapitulates major historical antigenic cluster transitions. Using integrated antigenicity score, we systematically identified two classes of key sites: global key sites with sustained impact on antigenic evolution, and cluster-transition determining sites that drive cluster transitions. These sites include most canonical epitopes and reveal additional functional residues previously overlooked, which may influence immune escape via cooperative effects or glycosylation. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of influenza antigenic evolution and provide novel insights for refining computational models. PREDAC-Transformer achieves high-precision prediction while attributing antigenic differences to individual residues, thereby linking viral genomic variation, antigenic change, and public health decision-making. This framework has the potential to reduce experimental burdens in influenza surveillance and assist in vaccine strain recommendation, thereby supporting global influenza control efforts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Benchmarking large-scale single-cell RNA-seq analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Billato, I., Pages, H., +4 authors, Risso, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing size of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets poses major computational challenges. This work benchmarks the scalability, efficiency, and accuracy of five widely used analysis frameworks (Seurat, OSCA, scrapper, Scanpy, and rapids_singlecell), focusing on the impact of algorithmic and infrastructural choices on performance. We performed a systematic comparison of these workflows using representative datasets, including the 1.3M mouse brain dataset for scalability and three smaller datasets (BE1, sc_mixology, and cord blood CITE-seq) with ground truth labels to assess clustering accuracy. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as a paradigmatic step to evaluate the computational performance of six SVD algorithms (exact, ARPACK, IRLBA, randomized, Jacobi, and incremental PCA) across multiple data representations (dense, sparse, HDF5) and hardware configurations (CPU vs GPU). All methods showed high concordance in PCA results, with negligible loss of accuracy in truncated approaches. GPU-based computation using rapids_singlecell provided a 15x speed-up over the best CPU methods, with moderate memory usage. On CPU, ARPACK and IRLBA were the most efficient for sparse matrices, while randomized SVD performed best for HDF5-backed data. Among full pipelines, rapids_singlecell was the fastest, whereas OSCA and scrapper achieved the highest clustering accuracy (ARI up to 0.97) in datasets with known cell identities. Performance differences were largely driven by the choice of highly variable genes (HVGs) and PCA implementation. The study highlights that scalability in scRNA-seq analysis depends critically on both algorithmic and infrastructural factors. GPU acceleration and optimized BLAS/LAPACK configurations markedly enhance performance, while Bioconductor-based pipelines remain robust in accuracy. The provided benchmarks offer practical guidelines for efficient and reliable analysis of large-scale single-cell datasets.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Mirgaux, M., Barcelli, V., +2 authors, Wintjens, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning has transformed how we predict protein structures and interactions, but its full potential in drug discovery is only beginning to be realized. In this study, we demonstrate that advanced deep learning tools, such as AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1/2, not only predict protein-ligand interactions with high accuracy but can also separate active drug compounds from inactive ones. We present a straightforward strategy called pairwise competitive docking, which ranks drug candidates by directly comparing how well they bind to a protein's target site. When applied to both bacterial and human enzymes, this method produced rankings that closely matched experimental results. We further show how this approach can guide the design of improved antibiotics and speed up the discovery of promising drug candidates from large chemical libraries. Overall, our findings highlight how machine learning can make structure-based drug design faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ODDB: Ocular Disease Database for integrated analysis of ocular disease gene drug relationships</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seemab, U., Kalatanova, A., +2 authors, Leinonen, H. O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and inherited retinal dystrophies are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, yet existing databases often address only limited aspects of these disorders. To fill this gap, we developed the Ocular Disease Database (ODDB), a web-based resource that integrates genes, biomarkers, variants, and drugs associated to ocular diseases. Data were systematically collected through literature mining of PubMed-indexed journals, the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and drug regulatory agency datasets. Multi-omics, experimental, and clinical information were harmonized using standardized integration workflows. The database is organized according to two complementary ontologies: one based on the anatomical site of pathology (cornea, retina, optic nerve) and another on gene inheritance pattern. ODDB currently covers over 170 ocular diseases, more than 1190 genes, 2400+ variants, and 386 drugs, including both approved and investigational compounds. Each record includes detailed annotations of associated genes, variants, therapeutic targets, and mechanisms of action. The platform supports interactive querying and network-based visualization of disease gene drug relationships. All data was internally validated for accuracy and are compliant with FAIR principles, ensuring accessibility and interoperability. ODDB (https://www.oculardiseases.fi/) provides a comprehensive and standardized reference for exploring molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities in ocular diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pitavastatin counteracts venetoclax resistance mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fruman, D., Buono, R., +14 authors, Carroll, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents is the standard of care for patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Loss of p53 function is strongly associated with venetoclax resistance, and adding venetoclax to 5-azacitidine provides no overall survival benefit in TP53-mutant AML. Other frequent mechanisms of venetoclax resistance in AML include FLT3 mutations, MCL-1 upregulation, and altered mitochondrial metabolism. It has been challenging to develop agents that target these mechanisms directly and combinatorially. Here we report that pitavastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA-reductase, promotes apoptosis and overcomes several venetoclax resistance mechanisms in human AML cells. At clinically achievable concentrations, pitavastatin treatment has potent cytotoxic activity in cells with mutations in TP53 or FLT3. The apoptotic mechanism involves p53-independent PUMA upregulation and reduced MCL-1 expression. Pitavastatin also suppresses mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism. The pro-apoptotic actions of pitavastatin depend on depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and can be recapitulated by inhibiting GGPP synthase or geranylgeranyltransferase-1 enzymes. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for adding pitavastatin to AML regimens to prevent or overcome venetoclax resistance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Adipocytes are dispensable in shaping the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment in the omentum</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mintz, R. L., Han, J., +10 authors, Randolph, G. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The omentum, a specialized adipose tissue within the peritoneum, is a primary niche for ovarian cancer (OC) dissemination during peritoneal carcinomatosis. Traditionally, omental adipocytes are thought to promote OC growth by supplying lipids, supported by evidence that global FABP4 deficiency reduces tumor progression. Here, we generated mice lacking mature adipocytes in the peritoneum, including the omentum. ID8 p53 deficient Brca2 deficient, BPPNM, and KPCA OC cells retained a propensity to seed regions typically associated with adipocytes, even without mature adipocytes. However, the lack of mature adipocytes did not suppress peritoneal OC expansion, whereas removing the adipocyte-free omentum did. Murine and human single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that endothelial FABP4 was high in the omentum. Indeed, endothelial cell-selective deficiency of FABP4 reduced OC growth in the peritoneum. These findings prompt a reevaluation of adipocyte contributions to OC progression and suggest a key role of the omental vasculature in supporting OC metabolic growth.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dynamic PD-L1 Regulation Shapes Tumor Immune Escape andResponse to Immunotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pell, B., Kalizhanova, A., +3 authors, Kashkynbayev, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A major challenge in cancer treatment is the ability of tumor cells to adapt to immunotherapy through immune escape, often mediated by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. To investigate this, we adapted an ordinary differential equation model of combination therapy, incorporating the dynamics of the immune checkpoint inhibitor Avelumab and the immunostimulant NHS-muIL12. Using literature-derived parameter values from a previous study, we refitted a single parameter across therapies, which showed that PD-L1 expression increased with immunotherapy, while Avelumab blocked its functional signaling, preventing PD-L1 from suppressing T-cell activity. Incorporating therapy-dependent, dynamically regulated PD-L1 expression enabled a biologically grounded mechanism to reproduce experimental observations, leading us to formulate PD-L1 tumor expression as a dynamic variable ($epsilon$) and providing a mechanistic basis for both therapeutic synergy and treatment failure. Our results indicate that tumor resistance is linked to dose-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 following NHS-muIL12 treatment, explaining treatment failure, while PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in combination therapy enables effective anti-tumor immune responses.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Review of Artificial Intelligence in 3D Printing. Part B: From In-Situ Monitoring and Print Process Optimization to Clinical Outcome Prediction.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nicholas J Iglesias, Sara E Munkwitz, +3 authors, Paulo G Coelho</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Three-dimensional (3D) printing has increasingly aided surgeons' ability to provide personalized care to complex patient pathologies in numerous surgical specialties. In craniofacial surgery, 3D printing can be used to produce contour models, surgical guides, splints, and craniofacial implantable devices specific to patient anatomy and pathology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another disruptive technology that is shaping biomedical engineering, and while 3D printing is no longer in its infancy, its capabilities can be improved by AI integration. Traditional approaches to 3D printing often require prolonged prototyping phases to create a product with the desired mechanical and chemical properties for a target application. 3D printing is poised for integration of AI for in-situ monitoring, postprint analysis, print process optimization, and the simulation/prediction of clinical outcomes. Real-time error detection and print correction driven by AI has proven to significantly improve print fidelity while reducing trial-and-error prototyping processes. The integration of these technologies is critical for the progression of personalized surgical care and the development of future treatment modalities, such as in-situ bioprinting onto live tissue. This comprehensive review aims to increase awareness of AI in 3D printing to promote future collaboration between the fields of tissue engineering, materials science, computer science, and surgery to maximize the integration of AI-directed 3D printing in personalized medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting Immunotherapy Outcomes in NSCLC Using RNA and Pathology from Multicenter Clinical Trials.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhaojun Wang, Yiran Fang, +30 authors, Dongqiang Zeng</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it remains crucial to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from immunotherapy and to explore potential combination treatment strategies. In this study, 1127 advanced NSCLC patients from multicenter randomized clinical trials (OAK, POPLAR, ORIENT-11) and an in-house cohort who received ICIs, ICIs combined with chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone are analyzed. Using bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic data, an RNA-based model, named the Lung Cancer Immunotherapy Response Assessment (LIRA), is developed, utilizing interaction analysis and a random forest algorithm to predict immunotherapy outcomes. LIRA outperforms PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden in predicting responses, particularly in identifying early progression risk during ICI monotherapy (HR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.11-0.20). Tumor profile analysis reveals that LRP8 and HDAC4 are associated with immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, scRNA-seq analysis of NSCLC tumors indicates a higher prevalence of T cells and a reduced proportion of epithelial cells in samples with a high LIRA-score. The deep learning model pinpointed critical high-attention regions within whole-slide images that contributed decisively to the LIRA predictions. In summary, these results demonstrate that LIRA enables independent risk stratification of NSCLC patients and provides insights into potential resistance mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine Learning Designed for Any Hematologic Flow Cytometry Data Set.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mammen J, Manta CP, +6 authors, Dietrich S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Flow cytometry is a key diagnostic technique in hematology that provides protein information at a single-cell level. Traditionally interpreted manually in a sequence of two-dimensional plots, automated analysis techniques have grown in significance in both research and clinics improving interrater reliability and speeding up analysis. Published tools usually require a specific diagnostic setup, which hinders widespread implementation. In this paper, we present the development of a software package and web app (diagnFlow) for the automated analysis of any in-house clinical flow cytometry data set. We exemplify the application of this classifier and its clinical benefit in lymphoma diagnosis and other settings. Routine performance for the focused diagnostic task was evaluated in a blinded one-examiner setup. Multiple customary workflows solving the task in an automated manner were designed using diagnFlow. Each workflow could improve on the performance of the manual interpretation. The most easily interpretable and computationally efficient workflow out-performed more complicated approaches and was made available as an easy-to-use web app. Same-sample wet laboratory data further elucidated the biological signal the classifier is based on. The approach made available as a web app was validated in additional data sets outperforming a competition-winning clustering-based approach. diagnFlow provides a valuable data set-agnostic approach to flow cytometry data sets previously not leveraged for automatic analysis while maintaining interpretability and resource efficiency.</p>
