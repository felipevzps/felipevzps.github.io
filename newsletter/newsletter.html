<h2 class="paper-title">Increasing the effective gene drive homing rate by targeting the haploinsufficient spermatogenesis gene KLHL10</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Peng, C. L., Kamau, W. S., +2 authors, Esvelt, K. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CRISPR-based gene drives represent a powerful new technology for limiting disease transmission and controlling invasive populations. These systems rely on homology-directed repair (HDR) to ''drive'' a genetic element through a population. However, mammals tend to favor non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which generates mutations that halt further drive propagation. Here, we describe the experimental characterization of a gene drive system targeting the haploinsufficient spermatogenesis gene KLHL10 in the laboratory mouse. Using a newly designed ''coding sequence cassette'' we introduce downstream guide RNAs within the gene, ensuring that sperm undergoing NHEJ are selectively removed from the population. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that targeting KLHL10 with constitutively expressed LbCas12a results in strong selection against frameshift-containing sperm, validating the core purification mechanism required for this drive strategy. Unexpectedly, we also observed that female offspring lacked most frameshift mutations, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for KLHL10 in oogenesis or early embryonic development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ensemble-DeepSets: an interpretable deep learning framework for single-cell resolution profiling of immunological aging</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, Y., Luo, Z., +5 authors, Han, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immunological aging (immunosenescence) drives increased susceptibility to infections and reduced vaccine efficacy in elderly populations. Current bulk transcriptomic aging clocks mask critical cellular heterogeneity, limiting the mechanistic dissection of immunological aging. Here, we present Ensemble-DeepSets, an interpretable deep learning framework that operates directly on single-cell transcriptomic data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to predict immunological age at the donor level. Benchmarking against 27 diverse senescence scoring metrics and existing transcriptomic clocks across four independent healthy cohorts demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in out-of-training-distribution age groups. The model's multi-scale interpretability uncovers both conserved and cohort-specific aging-related gene signatures. Crucially, we reveal divergent contributions of T cell subsets (pro-youth) versus B cells and myeloid compartments (pro-aging), and utilize single-cell resolution to highlight heterogeneous aging-associated transcriptional states within these functionally distinct subsets. Application to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) reveals accelerated immune aging linked to myeloid activation and altered myeloid subset compositions, illustrating clinical relevance. This framework provides a versatile tool for precise quantification and mechanistic dissection of immunosenescence, providing insights critical for biomarker discovery and therapeutic targeting in aging and immune-mediated diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Algorithm for Reversible Jump Inference of Motifs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Farhat, A. M., Freddolino, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding sequence specificity in transcription factor binding is a critical step in understanding gene regulation. DNA-protein binding experiments such as ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq can reveal where on the genome a particular transcription factor of interest is bound, and similar experiments such as ATAC-seq or DNase hypersensitivity can reveal the profile of genome-wide protein binding and chromatin accessibility at the time of an experiment. However, demultiplexing the binding of multiple transcription factors represented in a single occupancy trace can be difficult. While many tools exist for extracting binding motifs from single transcription factor assays, comparatively few exist for deconvolving binding motifs from many transcription factor experiments, and they often require additional information on the number and/or nature of factors to be considered. Here, we developed The Algorithm for Reversible Jump Inference of Motifs (TARJIM), which translates DNA-protein binding data by inferring a set of sequence motifs that explain the data in question. By using a reversible jump Metropolis Hastings algorithm, TARJIM is able to infer both the number of motifs present and their sequence identity by using Bayesian techniques on the binding model itself. Using TARJIM, we have shown that not only can we deduce sequence motifs for known transcription factors, we are also able to extract sequence motifs from a mixture of sequence binding data, allowing us to extract information even from protein-DNA binding experiments where we do not know the number of transcription factors represented.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">OMNI: Optimized Multi-view Network Integration with Heterogeneous Graph Attention for Biomedical Interaction Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Borah, G. S., Tiwari, S., Nagamani, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Accurate prediction of biomedical relationships, such as chemical gene interactions, is fundamental to understanding disease mechanisms and advancing drug discovery. With the rapid growth of heterogeneous biological data, modeling large scale, multi entity networks has become increasingly challenging. Traditional approaches, including homogeneous GNNs (e.g., GCN, GAT) and meta-path-based random walks, struggle to efficiently capture high order, diverse neighborhood information in complex biomedical graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-view heterogeneous graph attention network (GAT) based architecture that effectively aggregates rich, heterogeneous interactions across multiple biomedical entity types. The proposed encoder captures comprehensive structural and semantic information while remaining computationally efficient. Through optimized aggregation strategies and multi-processing, the model generates high-quality node embeddings with significantly reduced training time. For relation prediction, multiple decoder architectures were evaluated, with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) identified as the most effective for accurate multi-type relation classification. The resulting network comprises 124,604 unique nodes and 48,482,286 interactions. Results: Experimental results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms state of the art methods, including CGINet, Node2Vec, and the GCN based BioNet, achieving an AUROC of 0.91 for chemical gene interaction prediction. The model further explores its ability to identify top ranking chemical gene interactions in cancer and to predict gene phytochemical relationships. Overall, this work introduces a scalable and powerful framework for biomedical relation prediction, with strong potential applications in drug screening and disease mechanism discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CoPhaser: generic modeling of biological cycles in scRNA-seq with context-dependent periodic manifolds</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Paychere, Y., Salati, A., +1 author, Naef, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological cycles such as the cell cycle and circadian rhythms are fundamental cell-autonomous processes that are often obscured in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by other sources of variation, including cell-type identity, metabolic or disease-associated states. Disentangling these continuous periodic trajectories from other forms of cellular variability remains a major challenge in single-cell analysis. Here, we introduce CoPhaser, an algorithm designed to learn context-dependent periodic manifolds that decompose scRNA-seq count data into independent periodic and non-periodic sources of variation, while maintaining interpretability of manifold coordinates across diverse biological contexts. CoPhaser employs a biologically informed variational autoencoder with a structured latent space that explicitly separates cycle phases from cellular context, while controlling their mutual information. By modeling gene expression as context-modulated harmonic functions, the model captures flexible but biologically motivated deformations of periodic manifolds. We demonstrate that CoPhaser recovers biologically accurate continuous cell-cycle phases across diverse RNA sequencing technologies, including highly heterogeneous situations such as development and cancer, without requiring prior knowledge of gene expression programs or cell-cycle states. In two cancer applications, CoPhaser reveals subtype-specific proliferation dynamics, identifying quiescent primitive states in relapsed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and distinguishes proliferation-driven gene overexpression from constitutive overexpression to uncover potential robust therapeutic targets in triple-negative breast cancer. CoPhaser readily generalizes to other periodic systems, enabling the reconstruction of circadian clocks in the mouse aorta and the identification of cell-type and subtype-specific circadian differences. Furthermore, it maps continuous endometrial remodeling across the human menstrual cycle, uncovering distinct transcriptional dynamics between women with endometriosis and controls. Together, CoPhaser provides a versatile and interpretable framework for dissecting the interplay between cellular identity and biological cycles in single-cell data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Best of Both Worlds? Optimising Graph-Based Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Profiling in Long and Short-Read Metagenomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mahoney, D. B. J., Maguire, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Environmental surveillance using metagenomic sequencing offers a powerful way to track emerging and mobile antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and inform public health mitigation strategies. Read-based analysis tools can sensitively detect AMR genes in metagenomes but provide little information about the surrounding genome. This prevents easily linking detected genes with particular host species or mobile genetic elements. On the other hand, contig-based analysis tools can provide this genomic context but systematically fail to recover many AMR genes. Querying the intermediate assembly graph directly may provide a trade-off between these strengths and weaknesses. However, many existing tools capable of querying assembly graphs are designed for applications other than gene detection such as pan-genomics, indexing, or scaffolding. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of six tools across four search paradigms was performed to determine the optimal graph querying tool for profiling AMR genes in both long and short-read metagenomic assembly graphs. Across mock and simulated metagenomes of varying complexity and read-type, BLAST-based graph alignment (as implemented by GraphAligner) consistently outperformed other graph alignment algorithms. Overall, graph-based methods correctly identified 21% to 46% more AMR genes in complex datasets than contig analyses; however, increases in recall were modest. Combining assembly graphs analyses with contig-based analyses identifies up to 56% additional AMR genes across both long and short-read datasets. This study highlights the challenges associated with metagenomic AMR surveillance and demonstrates that graph-based analyses offer a useful tool in maximising sensitive identification of AMR genes and their genomic context from these data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ColabPCR: A validated Google Colaboratory Notebook for Reproducible and Precise Primer Design.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lozano, M. J., Dallachiesa, D., +3 authors, Pena, E. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method often has a lower success rate when amplifying specific genomic regions in eukaryotic genomes. This is frequently due to the non-specific annealing of primers at various genomic locations. To address this issue, we created ColabPCR, a program specifically designed to optimize the selection and evaluation of primers for a defined genomic region. ColabPCR refines primer length and melting temperature parameters through the utilization of Primer3 software, and it quantifies the number of potential off-target binding regions within the target genome via BLASTn analysis. Furthermore, the program facilitates the integration of restriction enzyme recognition sites at the 5 prime termini of primers and provides a mechanism to confirm the absence of such sites within the intended amplification region. ColabPCR centralizes all these functionalities within a single interface, utilizing Google Colab computational resources to ensure high performance and accessibility without requiring local software installation. We rigorously validated ColabPCR by designing primers for promoter and terminator regions within the Daucus carota (DCARv2, DH1v3) reference genome. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate significantly enhanced success rates, particularly when primers exhibiting off-target binding are excluded from the primer design process. In summary, ColabPCR offers a user-friendly and powerful solution that simplifies and enhances the primer design and evaluation workflow, leading to increased accuracy and success in molecular biology experiments.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Variational Inference with Node Embeddings (VINE) for Scalable Bayesian Phylogenetics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Siepel, A., Hassett, R., Staklinski, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bayesian phylogenetic inference is now widely used but remains heavily reliant on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which is computationally intensive and requires careful convergence monitoring. Variational inference (VI) is an appealing alternative that approximates posterior distributions without sampling, but existing variational approaches for phylogenetics have seen limited adoption owing to constraints in accuracy, speed, and scalability. Here we introduce Variational Inference with Node Embeddings (VINE), a variational phylogenetic inference method with striking improvements over prior work. VINE supports both standard DNA substitution models and CRISPR barcode-mutation models for cell-lineage phylogenies. Its key innovations are: embedding taxa in a high-dimensional Euclidean space; backpropagating gradients through fast distance-based phylogeny inference algorithms; introducing a sampling-free approximate estimator for the VI evidence lower bound; and enhancing posterior flexibility using normalizing flows. Across simulated and empirical datasets, VINE yields accurate posterior approximations for datasets with as many as 1000 taxa in a fraction of the time required for state-of-the-art MCMC-based methods.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alternative (non-B) nucleic acid structures such as Z-nucleic acids are emerging as key regulators of genome function. The density and distribution of Z-nucleic acid sequences across organismal and viral genomes can provide insights into their biological roles and evolutionary trajectory. Using our recently developed ZSeeker algorithm, we systematically analyzed over 280,000 organismal genome assemblies, identifying more than 850 million putative Z-forming loci. We also incorporated genomic coordinates, Z-score, and taxonomic metadata, enabling cross-species comparative and functional analyses. We introduce ZSeekerDB, the first large-scale, multi-taxon database cataloging Z-nucleic acid sequences, across organisms representing all major branches of life. ZSeekerDB enables interactive searches, visualizations, and downloads of Z-nucleic acid sequence data for independent analysis. ZSeekerDB is implemented as a web-portal for browsing, analyzing and downloading Z-forming loci, publicly available at https://zseeker-db.com/.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">FastHer: a fast and accurate estimator of local heritability from GWAS summary statistics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Svishcheva, G. R., Tsepilov, Y. A., Axenovich, T. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Local heritability estimation is essential for analysing the genetic architecture of complex traits. Although the contemporary HEELS method, by using GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrices, achieves accuracy comparable to the gold-standard GREML method (Genomic Restricted Maximum Likelihood), its computational complexity makes the analysis of extended genomic regions (spanning tens of thousands of SNPs) a practically intractable task. We present FastHer, a maximum-likelihood-based method that, like HEELS, retains GREML-level accuracy while overcoming its computational limitations. The key innovation lies in an analytical reformulation of the likelihood function using a single eigen-decomposition of the LD matrix, yielding orders-of-magnitude acceleration. In benchmarks, FastHer demonstrated an approximately 100-fold speedup when analysing genomic regions containing ~10,000 SNPs. FastHer thus enables highly accurate and rapid local heritability analysis for extended genomic regions typical of biobank-scale data, making genome-wide studies computationally tractable. The method is implemented as an open-source R package.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Fan, Y., Tan, K., +6 authors, Li, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hepatotoxicity poses a critical safety challenge for AAV-mediated gene therapy. To mitigate this, we evaluated strategies to minimize off-target hepatic transduction using an antibody expression model. We compared (i) muscle-restricted wild-type AAV9 expression and (ii) a novel myotropic capsid variant, AAV.eM. In humanized B-NDG mice bearing Raji-Luc lymphomas, intravenous administration of AAV9-MHCK7 encoding an antiCD19&amp;antiCD3 bispecific T-cell engager failed to reduce tumor burden. Conversely AAV.eM-MHCK7-antiCD19&amp;antiCD3 substantially alleviated tumor burden and achieved lymphoma clearance. By leveraging tissue-specific microRNAs, precise restriction of AAV.eM-mediated transgene expression to skeletal or cardiac muscle was achieved. Incorporating a heart-specific miR-208a binding site into the transgene 3 UTR did not compromise therapeutic efficacy when delivered via AAV.eM-MHCK7. Intramuscular delivery of AAV9-MHCK7-antiCD19&amp;antiCD3 or AAV.eM-MHCK7-antiCD19&amp;antiCD3 both cleared Raji-Luc tumors at a dose of 5E+12 vg/kg, underscoring the advantage of localized and targeted rAAV delivery over systemic administration. Notably, only AAV.eM-MHCK7-antiCD19&amp;antiCD3 achieved tumor eradication at a tenfold lower intramuscular dose (5E+11 vg/kg), reducing manufacturing costs and risks of dose-dependent immunogenicity and toxicity. Our findings demonstrate that combining tissue-specific targeting, via engineered capsids or tissue-selective promoters, with local delivery robustly reduces off-target hepatic expression, providing a strategic framework for enhancing the safety of AAV-based gene therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Mechanistic Model of Oncolytic Virus-CAR T Therapy Identifies Memory-Dependent Control of Solid Tumors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">PELEN, N. N., Jackson, T. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable remissions in hematologic malignancies, yet its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited by antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and poor T-cell persistence. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) provide a complementary therapeutic strategy by directly lysing tumor cells and reshaping local immune responses. Motivated by emerging evidence that OVs can also induce dual-specific, memory-like CAR T cells, we develop a unified mathematical framework that integrates these interacting modalities. The model distinguishes antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor populations, tracks key viral and immune compartments, and incorporates OV-mediated microenvironmental activation alongside CAR T-cell stimulation. This baseline formulation provides a platform for assessing whether additional mechanisms---such as OV-induced CAR T-cell memory---are necessary for durable tumor control. Sensitivity analysis of the memory-free system using partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) identifies four dominant drivers of therapeutic outcome: antigen-negative tumor dynamics, viral kinetics, CAR T-cell cytotoxic effectiveness, and PD-1/PD-L1--mediated T-cell exhaustion. While these mechanisms can generate strong early responses, they are insufficient to prevent late relapse driven by antigen-negative tumor regrowth. Introducing a reduced memory variable to represent OV-driven CAR T recall fundamentally alters this behavior: enhanced memory induction and CAR T responsiveness sustain effector T-cell levels and enable long-term control of antigen-negative tumor populations. Together, these results highlight OV-induced CAR T-cell memory as a critical determinant of durable therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Incomplete developmental silencing of cancer-testis antigen BORIS in humanized mouse model promotes cancer susceptibility</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Price, E., Pugacheva, E., +5 authors, Lobanenkov, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer-testis antigens are genes normally restricted to the germline but aberrantly activated in many cancers, where their role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. BORIS (CTCFL), a testis-specific paralog of the chromatin organizer CTCF, is one such antigen that shows limited conservation between humans and mice, complicating in vivo functional studies. Here, we generated humanized mice in which both alleles of the endogenous Boris locus are replaced with the full-length human BORIS gene, including its highly diverged cis-regulatory elements. These fully humanized mice maintain normal fertility, indicating accurate germline expression and preserved BORIS function despite evolutionary divergence. However, unlike the strictly testis-specific expression of mouse Boris, human BORIS escapes complete somatic silencing, producing mosaic expression in a minority of mouse somatic cells. This ectopic expression is associated with reduced survival, increased tumor incidence and a shift of tumor spectrum toward aggressive lymphomas. Transcriptomic and chromatin profiling revealed that ectopic human BORIS reactivates testes-specific genes in the soma, including regulators of meiosis and DNA repair, through direct chromatin binding. This transcriptional reprogramming was consistent across tissues and clonal cell lines, revealing a dominant tissue-independent gene activation program. These findings demonstrate that when human BORIS escapes epigenetic silencing in somatic cells, it connects aberrant germline gene activation with increased cancer susceptibility in vivo.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Kirichenko, E., Nabiullina, R., +11 authors, Institute of Living Systems</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This work introduces a novel and specialized dataset of high-resolution fluorescence microscopic images focused on astrocytic gap junctions, aiming to get insights into intercellular communication in both healthy and pathological brain conditions. The dataset includes 20 z-stack image series -- 10 from human glioblastoma tissue and 10 from healthy rat brain tissue -- each containing between 24 and 126 optical slices. These images were acquired using standardized protocols following immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies against connexin 43 (Cx43), enabling visualization of gap junction localization at the subcellular level. The dataset is uniquely tailored to support detailed morphological and quantitative analyses of gap junction networks, featuring metadata including species, age, sex, imaging parameters, tissue characteristics, and localization of gap junctions in images provided by bounding boxes and image masks. Its structure facilitates comparative studies across physiological states and species, enhancing translational and evolutionary perspectives on astrocytic connectivity. Given the labor-intensive nature of manual gap junction quantification and 3D statistical analysis for Z-stacks, this dataset serves as a resource for the development of machine learning tools capable of automating the detection and analysis of Cx43-positive signals.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A MYC Family Switch: L-MYC Drives and Maintains Neuroendocrine Lineage Programs in Prostate Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sivalingam, J., Cho, K., +4 authors, Yu, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive, therapy-resistant subtype that emerges through lineage plasticity following androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition. Although MYC family oncogenes are central to prostate cancer progression, the role of MYCL (L-MYC) in NEPC has remained unclear. Here, we show that MYCL is selectively and robustly upregulated in NEPC patient samples and cell line models, whereas MYC is downregulated and MYCN remains low, revealing a lineage-associated MYC family switch. MYCL expression strongly correlates with the neuroendocrine lineage regulators ASCL1 and INSM1 and inversely with adenocarcinoma-associated genes. Mechanistically, MYCL activation is not driven by genomic amplification but reflects a permissive epigenetic landscape. Functionally, MYCL overexpression suppresses AR signaling and induces neuroendocrine-like transcriptional reprogramming, whereas MYCL knockdown disrupts neuroendocrine lineage identity and restores adenocarcinoma-associated gene expression, including MYC. We further identify ASCL1 and INSM1 as upstream regulators of MYCL, establishing a conserved neuroendocrine transcriptional axis. Together, these findings define MYCL as a lineage-specific regulator that drives neuroendocrine identity and plasticity in advanced prostate cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bivalent CD47 Immunotoxin for Targeted Therapy of Lung Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ma, J., Ravindran Menon, D., +11 authors, Wang, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, with ~2.5 million people diagnosed and ~1.5 million deaths each year. While the last two decades have yielded substantial progress with systemic targeted and immune therapies improving treatment responses in subgroups of patients with advanced and refractory lung cancer, there is still a dire unmet clinical need to develop more effective therapies with durable responses. CD47 receptors are overexpressed on the surface of a variety of malignant tumor cells including lung cancer. Although there has been increasing interest in developing targeting antibodies against CD47 for immunotherapy, they failed clinical trials due to their dose-limiting toxicities, primarily hematopoietic toxicity. Using a unique diphtheria toxin resistant Pichia pastoris yeast expression system, we have developed a diphtheria toxin-based bivalent CD47 immunotoxin (bi-CD47-IT) for targeted therapy of CD47+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bi-CD47-IT demonstrated compelling preclinical efficacy in multiple NSCLC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, including subcutaneous, orthotopic, metastatic and humanized models. This study demonstrates the remarkable preclinical activity of bi-CD47-IT against various lung cancer models, making bi-CD47-IT a novel and promising therapeutic approach for NSCLC.</p>
