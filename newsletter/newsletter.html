<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning for extracellular vesicles enables diagnostic and therapeutic nanobiotechnology.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ashutosh Tiwari, Widodo, +2 authors, Tsung-Rong Kuo</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as naturally bioactive nanomaterials with intrinsic biocompatibility and targeting potential. Recent integration of machine learning (ML) into EV research has accelerated advances in molecular profiling, structure-function prediction, and rational design of vesicle-based therapeutics. Yet, the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of EV populations pose major analytical challenges. Concurrently, machine learning is revolutionizing biomedical science by uncovering patterns in high dimensional, multimodal datasets. In EV research, ML has enabled major advances across automated imaging, multi omics integration, disease classification, therapeutic engineering, and standardization. This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of ML-enabled EV studies, organized by data modality (imaging, omics, cytometry), algorithmic paradigm (CNNs, random forests, autoencoders, GNNs), and translational application (diagnosis, prognosis, drug delivery, manufacturing QC). Unlike prior reviews that have typically considered EV biology and AI methods in relative isolation, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy that explicitly links EV data modalities, machine learning architectures, and clinical use-cases, thereby providing a structured map of the field. We discuss key technical barriers including data sparsity, batch variability, and model explainability and spotlight frontier developments such as federated learning, self-supervised models, and real-time EV analytics. At the nexus of computational intelligence and nanomedicine, ML-enhanced EV platforms are rapidly progressing from fragmented innovations to clinically actionable systems. This review offers a roadmap for advancing AI-integrated EV technologies in cancer precision medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NetCrafter: Ontology-derived gene network modeling and interpretation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lee, Y., Kim, S., +7 authors, Yoon, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the complex nature of multi-functional interactions among genes is crucial for interpreting omics data. We developed NetCrafter, an ontology-driven platform for constructing de novo gene networks that are specific to each input gene list and quantitatively defined by ontology-weighted similarity. By incorporating the probabilistic association of ontology or curated gene sets into a weighted Tanimoto similarity metric, NetCrafter transforms enrichment results into quantitative semantic similarity scores between genes, enabling the creation of context-specific statistical networks. These networks can be further decomposed into optimal sub-networks, facilitating multi-functional interpretation and the identification of gene interaction hotspots. NetCrafter also supports the integration of heterogeneous omics-derived gene lists through consensus ontology scoring. Importantly, this list-specific, quantitative framework reveals functional hotspots and target-biomarker relationships - even in cases where ontology terms alone are not predictive of node-level attributes such as CRISPR efficacy. NetCrafter provides an interactive platform for constructing and interpreting dynamic, context-specific gene networks, leveraging ontology-based functional associations to uncover underlying mechanisms and identify key nodes. It is freely available at https://netcrafter.sookmyung.ac.kr and integrated into Q-omics platform (https://qomics.ai) to enhance the utility of cancer omics data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mitigating Bias in Spatial Transcriptomic Pipelines via Human Feedback</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Boyeau, P., Bates, S., +2 authors, Yosef, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological discovery from experimental data, particularly large-scale assays, requires extensive preprocessing, during which raw outputs (e.g., images, sequences) are processed into structured forms that are more amenable to analysis. While statistical methods for such processed data are at the core of computational biology, the problem of coping with uncertainties introduced during preprocessing is a significant and underexplored issue. We address this issue in the context of differential expression analysis in spatial transcriptomics, which depends on a series of preprocessing steps, including demarcation of cell regions (segmentation), quantification of gene expression in cells, and cell-type annotation. We introduce Corrected Spatial Differential Expression (CSDE), a method that builds on Prediction-Powered Inference to leverage a small set of expert-validated data points (cells) to account for uncertainty due to preprocessing errors. Using two case studies, we demonstrate that CSDE produces more reliable and calibrated estimates of differential expression compared to the prevalent approach that neglects the impact of preprocessing. CSDE incorporates an efficient workflow to generate the required expert-annotated data, and is available as open-source at https://github.com/YosefLab/CSDE.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TcrDesign: De novo design of epitope specific full-length T cell receptors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Diao, K., Chen, J., +5 authors, Liu, X.-S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> T cell receptors (TCRs) are essential for adaptive immune recognition. Recently computational tools have been developed to predict the interactions between TCR and epitope, and artificial intelligence models have been proposed to generate the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) region of {beta} chain TCR. However, de novo design of experimentally validated, functional, full-length epitope-specific TCRs remains a significant challenge. Here we developed TcrDesign, a deep learning framework based on large-scale unlabeled TCR and epitope datasets to generate epitope-specific, full-length TCRs. TcrDesign comprises two modules: TcrDesign-B for TCR-pMHC binding prediction with state-of-the-art accuracy, and TcrDesign-G for functional full-length TCR sequence generation. Pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets using transformer-based architectures, TcrDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance in both TCR-epitope binding prediction and de novo TCR sequence generation. Furthermore, epitope-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding and functional activation of TcrDesign-generated TCRs were experimentally validated. TcrDesign provides an efficient and modular approach for designing epitope-specific full-length TCRs, with experimental validation confirming its utility.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PathDiffusion: modeling protein folding pathway using evolution-guided diffusion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhao, K., Xiang, C., +7 authors, Yang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite remarkable advances in protein structure prediction, a fundamental question remains unresolved: how do proteins fold from unfolded conformations into their native states? Here, we introduce PathDiffusion, a novel generative framework that simulates protein folding pathways using evolution-guided diffusion models. PathDiffusion first extracts structure-aware evolutionary information from 52 million predicted structures the AlphaFold database. Then an evolution-guided diffusion model with a dual-score fusion strategy is trained to generate high-fidelity folding pathways. Unlike existing deep learning methods, which primarily sample equilibrium ensembles, PathDiffusion explicitly models the temporal evolution of folding. On a benchmark of 52 proteins with experimentally validated folding pathways, PathDiffusion accurately reconstructs the order of folding events. We further demonstrate its versatility across four challenging applications: (1) recapitulating Anton's molecular dynamics trajectory for 12 fast-folding proteins, (2) reproducing functionally important local folding-unfolding transitions in 20 proteins, (3) characterizing conformational ensembles of 50 intrinsically disordered proteins, and (4) resolving distinct folding mechanisms among 3 TIM-barrel proteins. We anticipate that PathDiffusion will be a valuable tool for probing protein folding mechanisms and dynamics at scale.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TomoSegNet: Augmented membrane segmentation for cryo-electron tomography by simulating the cellular context</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seghiri, R., Gallego-Nicolas, J. D., +8 authors, Martinez-Sanchez, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Membrane segmentation is an essential task in the workflow for processing cryo-electron tomography data. Recently, machine learning algorithms have successfully been adopted to perform membrane segmentation. However, the performance of these approaches is limited by the training dataset, as models are trained from manual annotations, thereby hindering the models' generalization and preventing the recovery of membranes that have vanished due to distortions. Here, we address these limitations by generating training data with a simulator. To provide a representative and realistic dataset, we have extended the current state-of-the-art in simulators for cryo-electron tomography by incorporating a biophysical model for membranes. We demonstrate that our machine learning model, trained solely from synthetic data, and thanks to the physical knowledge learned from the simulator, outperforms the current state-of-the-art for membrane segmentation in a diverse set of experimental data. This performance is particularly noteworthy in terms of recovering membranes lost due to imaging distortions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Leveraging Unified Sequence-Structure Representations for Enhanced Protein Stability Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ahmed, Y., Mahmoud, K., Salah, O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein thermal stability, quantified by the change in Gibbs free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G) upon mutation, is critical for drug design and enzyme engineering. Current multi-modal deep learning models, despite integrating sequence, often struggle with indirect information fusion and incomplete capture of sequence-structure interactions. We introduce ProStab-Former, addressing these limitations by establishing a unified sequence-structure representation space for protein stability prediction. It leverages a frozen, multi-modal protein foundation encoder for residue-level feature extraction. Fine-tuned modules include Stability-Aware Attention Layers (SAAL) with structural prior bias and mutation-aware gating, and an Epistatic Interaction Module for multi-point mutation prediction. The model achieves superior or competitive performance, surpassing a state-of-the-art baseline. Ablation confirms SAAL's critical role; strong generalization is shown across tasks including melting temperature prediction and pathogenic mutation classification. Its exceptional efficiency, predicting numerous single-point mutations in a single pass, positions it as a practical tool for high-throughput protein engineering and variant effect analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">mtDNA-Network: a web tool to explore mitochondrial variant profiles in complex diseases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cavaleiro de Macedo, L. C., Barra-Matos, G., +5 authors, Araujo, G. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) provides valuable insights into human evolution, population diversity, and disease etiology. Here, we present the mtDNA-network (https://apps.lghm.ufpa.br/mtdna/), an integrative bioinformatics database and tool for the visualization and analysis of mitochondrial variants (single-nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions). The mtDNA-network was upgraded to enable investigation of mtDNA in admixed Brazilian individuals with substantial contributions from uniparental Indigenous and African ancestries. We implement a bioinformatics pipeline to harmonize variant calling across 339 mtDNA samples. The dataset supports general genetic population analysis and variant mapping for complex diseases, including Parkinson's disease (104 cases and 75 controls), leprosy (33 cases and 37 controls), and somatic gastric cancer (40 cases and 50 controls). The mtDNA-network tool features an intuitive interface and analytical dashboards for transitions, transversions, heteroplasmy, and variant-disease networks, and serves as a strategic resource for advancing research in population genetics and precision medicine in underrepresented populations. We reinforce the critical need to expand non-European genomic representation in global databases to promote more equitable genomic diversity studies and clinically relevant discoveries.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Signal Strength Aware Latent Spaces Reveal Molecularly Distinct Substructures within Human Kidney Tissue</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Delacour, P.-L., Migas, L., +4 authors, Van de Plas, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As datasets grow increasingly high-dimensional and complex, distinguishing a condensed set of interpretable underlying factors becomes essential. In spatial omics, for example, hundreds to thousands of molecular features per observation promise unprecedented biological insight. However, without meaningful latent representations, that potential remains markedly untapped. We propose a new approach based on the beta-variational autoencoder and kernel density estimation to dissect data along independent, uncertainty-aware, and interpretable (yet nonlinear) latent axes. We include a novel comparative-latent-traversal algorithm to translate latent findings back into the original measurement context. Demonstrating on imaging mass spectrometry-based molecular imaging of human kidney, the approach's disentangling properties are shown to impress a latent space structure that separates signal strength from relative signal content, offering exceptional chemical insight. Our approach uncovers unexpected subdivisions within kidney proximal tubules, confirmed to be biological, and reveals hereto-unknown lipid species differentiating them. This confirms our workflow's potential as an interpretation-and-hypothesis-generating discovery tool.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Xu, Z.-G., Xue, H.-C., +1 author, Wang, J.-W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interactive visualization is critical for interpreting single-cell atlases, yet existing web-based tools struggle to handle the growing scale of multimillion-cell datasets, often constrained by browser memory limits and rendering latency. Here, we present AtlasMap, a scalable visualization framework that overcomes these bottlenecks through a multi-resolution, tile-based architecture. Unlike conventional systems that transfer cell-level data to the client, AtlasMap employs an offline preprocessing module to generate quadtree-based spatial aggregations stored in compressed Zarr v3 formats. A high-performance Go backend dynamically renders these summaries as PNG tiles, allowing a lightweight frontend to support fluid pan-and-zoom exploration similar to digital geographic maps. Systematic benchmarking against leading tools (including cellxgene and UCSC Cell Browser) demonstrates that AtlasMap decouples visualization performance from dataset size. While point-based approaches incurred prohibitive client-side memory costs or failed entirely at the 11-million-cell scale, AtlasMap maintained sub-second startup latency and a negligible browser footprint (&lt;5 MB). By shifting computational pressure from the browser to an optimized server-side pipeline, AtlasMap enables accessible, high-fidelity exploration of ultra-scale single-cell datasets on standard hardware.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Critical role of cell competition in gliomagenesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jiang, Y., Ahn, R., +23 authors, Zong, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Malignant glioma is incurable. Using a mouse genetic mosaic system to generate sporadic Trp53,Nf1-null OPCs, we previously identified oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) as a cell-of-origin of glioma. Here, we report that pre-malignant Trp53,Nf1-null OPCs outcompete wildtype counterparts during their expansion. Blocking competition by mutating/strengthening wildtype OPCs impeded both pre-malignant progression and malignant expansion of glioma. In-tissue phosphoproteomic profiling revealed an enrichment of phosphopeptides related to RNA splicing and protein translation at the peak of cell competition, suggesting that competitiveness may stem from unique protein species. Among candidates was mTORC1, whose pharmacological inhibition or genetic disruption resulted in a loss of competitiveness in our mouse model. Finally, analysis of patient biopsies and interrogating the role of individual gliomagenic mutations in OPC competition supported its relevance in human gliomas. Together, these findings identified the driving role of competitive interactions among OPCs in gliomagenesis, and suggest unconventional therapeutic strategies to target this process.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">p21(CIP1/WAF1)-mediated partial senescence supports steroidogenesis and therapy resistance in primary prostate cancer cultures</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Toscano-Guerra, E., Maggio, V., +10 authors, Paciucci, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Progression of prostate cancer to castration-resistant disease is driven by early adaptive mechanisms that remain poorly defined. Increasing evidence suggests that senescence-associated programs and intratumoral steroidogenesis may contribute to therapeutic resistance, but their functional interplay in hormone-naive disease is unclear. In this study, Hormone-naive primary prostate cancer cultures (hnPCs) were established from diagnostic biopsies and characterized for proliferation, therapeutic response, senescence markers, and steroidogenic gene expression. Functional relevance of CDKN1A was assessed by knockdown experiments. Public transcriptomic datasets from ETS fusion-negative, AR signaling inhibitor-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were interrogated for clinical validation. hnPCs exhibited low proliferative capacity yet intrinsic resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel. Most cultures displayed coordinated overexpression of CDKN1A/p21 together with steroidogenic enzymes, particularly AKR1C3, alongside p16(INK4a) expression and SA-{beta}-galactosidase activity, consistent with a partial senescence-like state. CDKN1A depletion selectively reduced AKR1C3 expression and increased proliferation in a subset of cultures, indicating that p21 maintains specific senescence-associated features while permitting adaptive plasticity. Analysis of ETS fusion-negative, ARSI-naive mCRPC tumors revealed positive correlations between CDKN1A and steroidogenic genes, supporting the translational relevance of this program. These findings identify a previously underrecognized CDKN1A-associated partial senescence program that supports steroidogenic reprogramming, survival, and early therapeutic resistance in aggressive prostate cancer. This adaptive state may predispose tumors to progression toward castration resistance and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic vulnerability in high-risk, ETS-negative disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Stratification of viral shedding patterns in saliva of COVID-19 patients.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hyeongki Park, Yoshimura Raiki, +13 authors, Taiga Miyazaki</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Living with COVID-19 requires continued vigilance against the spread and emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). Rapid and accurate saliva diagnostic testing, alongside basic public health responses, is a viable option contributing to effective transmission control. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva is not as advanced as our understanding of the respiratory tract. Here, we analyzed longitudinal viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 144 patients with mild COVID-19 (a combination of our collected data and published data). Using a mathematical model, we quantified individual-level viral dynamics and stratified them into three groups using a clustering approach. Notably, the three groups exhibited distinct differences in viral RNA detection durations: 11.5 days (95% CI: 10.6-12.4), 17.4 days (16.6-18.2), and 30.0 days (28.1-31.8), respectively. Surprisingly, this stratified grouping remained unexplained despite our analysis of 47 types of clinical data, including basic demographic information, clinical symptoms, results of blood tests, and vital signs. Additionally, we quantified the expression levels of 92 micro-RNAs in a subset of saliva samples, but these also failed to explain the observed stratification, although the mir-1846 level may have been weakly correlated with peak viral load. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in saliva, highlighting the challenges in predicting the duration of viral RNA detection without indicators that directly reflect an individual's immune response, such as antibody induction. Given the significant individual heterogeneity in the kinetics of saliva viral shedding, identifying biomarker(s) for viral shedding patterns will be crucial for improving public health interventions in the era of living with COVID-19.</p>
