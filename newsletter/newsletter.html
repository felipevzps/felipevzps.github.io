<h2 class="paper-title">MAAD: Multidimensional Antiviral Antibody Database</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Y., Wang, J., +6 authors, Wang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibodies have emerged as central components of therapeutic strategies against viral infectious diseases, functioning as key effectors in both prevention and treatment. While traditional antibody discovery has relied heavily on high-throughput screening, the field is now shifting toward rational antibody design, which requires integrative insights into sequence-structure-function relationships. However, the absence of a standardized and well-annotated antibody database integrating these multidimensional features hampers systematic exploration, cross-pathogen comparison, and rational antibody design. Here, we introduce the Multidimensional Antiviral Antibody Database (MAAD; http://www.xxx), a curated platform dedicated to antibody nanobody and single-chain variable fragment targeting three high-impact RNA virus families, Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV), Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus), and Pneumoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus), due to the large, high-quality datasets accumulated in recent years. MAAD further incorporates a suite of interactive analysis modules, including CDR annotation, similarity-based CDR3 sequence analysis, V/J gene usage profiling, sequence-based clustering and structure-based antigen-antibody interfaces residues with per-site entropy and mutation rate profiling. These features enable in-depth exploration of antibody sequence characteristics, thereby facilitating functional and structural insights for rational antibody design. Together, by bridging antibody sequence, structure and function, MAAD offers an open and standardized platform that advances comparative antiviral research and supports therapeutic antibody discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative study of Dog and Human Lipid Droplet-associated protein (PLIN2)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">sahu, G., Behera, A., +3 authors, Irungbam, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) are vital organelles that store energy, manage oxidative stress, and coordinate cellular signaling. A key protein family associated with LDs is the perilipins, with perilipin 2 (PLIN2) being prominent. This study focuses on a comparative analysis of canine and human PLIN2 to understand their structural and functional similarities. The genomic data for PLIN2 in both species were curated, revealing location, transcripts, exons, and introns. Sequence analysis demonstrated 85% identity between dog and human PLIN2, with conserved residues essential for structural and functional roles. Amino acid composition analysis revealed similarities in charged residues and in stabilizing and destabilizing residues. Despite their structural similarities (72% common secondary structure elements), a 3D comparison revealed significant differences in conformation. Physicochemical properties, including stability indices, were found to be distinct, possibly influencing their interactions. The study highlights the conservation of PLIN2's functional regions, shedding light on its role in protecting LDs from degradation across species.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identifying gene regulation modules associated with tumor metastasis using a network decomposition approach and combinatorial fusion analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Astuti, A., Schweikert, C., +1 author, KALOK, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The hypothesis that modular decomposition of molecular networks into gene regulatory modules (GRMs) enables identification of metastasis-associated gene candidates was systematically evaluated. We developed an efficient bioinformatics approach to identify metastasis-associated GRMs in cancer networks. Using a subgraph method to extract GRMs, we applied combinatorial fusion analysis (CFA) to prioritize them based on relevance. To validate the top-ranked GRMs, we employed the hallmark of cancer annotations, enrichment analysis, drug-target gene evaluation, and survival analysis. The cooperativity effect of GRMs was examined through comparative analysis with previously published studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively identifies metastasis-associated GRMs relative to existing methods. Robustness was assessed through ten feature combinations and comparisons of three- node versus four-node GRMs. Results consistently confirmed the method's reliability across different scenarios. This integrated approach combines the subgraph method and CFA to uncover metastasis-associated GRMs effectively. Validation through enrichment analysis, drug-target gene insights, and survival data demonstrates its potential for identifying metastasis-associated target genes and discovering therapeutic drug candidates. Compared to three KIRC cohorts metastasis studies, our approach more effectively identifies GRMs associated with metastasis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Performance of Information Theory Derived Semantic Similarity Algorithms for Differential Diagnosis and Clustering</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">COLEMAN, B. D., Danis, D., +1 author, Robinson, P. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Semantic similarity analysis with Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) enables fuzzy, specificity weighted comparisons of clinical manifestations of individuals and diseases and can be used to support differential diagnostics or to stratify cohorts. Many methods have been proposed to calculate semantic similarity for various applications, including the Phenomizer, which calculates the average best match over all terms in the query and disease, and set-based methods ranging from the Jaccard Intersection to methods that leverage the conditional information content to calculate similarity. However, these methods have not been described under a single mathematical model or robustly compared using a comprehensive data set. Here, we describe several semantic similarity algorithms using derivations based on information theory, propose three of our own variations to these models, and compare the performance of each approach for differential diagnostic ranking and phenotypic clustering. We find that Phenomizer performs better when diseases are ranked by similarity alone, without generating p-values. Additionally, non-normalized algorithms that use conditional information perform similarly to Phenomizer for differential diagnosis. In contrast, normalized algorithms perform best when clustering cohorts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Estimating Boltzmann Statistical Energy for Proteins from 3D Structure Using Pairwise Amino Acid Energy Matrix - GEM-X2120-N871</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">GURUPRASAD, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A pairwise amino acid energy matrix: GEM-X2120-N871 is developed for evaluating the Boltzmann statistical energy (BSE) for proteins of known 3D structure. The matrix was derived from a dataset of representative protein crystal structures and NMR structures selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The pairwise amino acid contacts separated by distance less than or equal to 3.2 Angstrom units in protein 3D structures was used to evaluate probabilities and propensities against background and the Boltzmann equation P(x) = e-(E(x)/KT) that links the probability of observing an event x with energy E(x) at a given temperature T was used to evaluate the BSE for proteins defined in Millielectron Volts (MeV) units. The BSE for a protein is obtained by summing up corresponding values for amino acid pairs from the matrix that satisfy the distance criterion in protein 3D structure. The landscape of BSE values for representative proteins based on propensities ranged between -890.99 MeV to 711.57 MeV among crystal structures and between -717.64 MeV to 234.78 MeV among NMR structures. Whereas, the landscape of BSE values based on probability alone was comparatively much narrower and ranged between 36.88 MeV to 131.28 MeV for the crystal structures and between 34.30 MeV to 102.23 MeV for the 871 NMR structures. Therefore, BSEs based on propensity with a broader range of values is suggested as being useful to discriminate individual proteins. The evaluation of BSE for proteins can be used to estimate relative gain or loss in energy between proteins that has applications in identifying low-energy conformations among an ensemble of protein conformations, or changes in energy due to drug/inhibitor/small molecule binding to the protein. The method was applied to evaluate changes in BSE for certain cancer drugs bound to protein targets and to analyse trends in predictions based on BSE with experimental observations on drug/inhibitor binding effectiveness as reported in literature.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative Molecular Docking and Toxicity Profiling of Buspirone and Tandospirone Targeting the HTR1A Receptor</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human serotonin 1A (HTR1A) receptor is a central target in the treatment of anxiety and mood disorders, and ligand efficacy is sensitive to receptor conformation. We performed a comparative in silico analysis of two clinically relevant 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and tandospirone, to examine their binding behavior and toxicity profiles. Molecular docking was run on the serotonin-bound HTR1A receptor (PDB ID: 7E2Y) using SwissDock, and toxicological predictions were generated with ProTox 3.0. Both ligands showed the greatest binding affinity for Chain A of the receptor (-6.14 kcal/mol for buspirone and -5.88 kcal/mol for tandospirone), suggesting a preferred receptor conformation that may mediate therapeutic efficacy. Buspirone demonstrated greater binding stability than tandospirone across models, while chains G and R showed weak or unstable interactions for both compounds. Predicted toxicity profiles indicated high probabilities of neurotoxicity and respiratory toxicity for both ligands, with blood-brain barrier penetration probabilities of 0.99 (buspirone) and 1.00 (tandospirone). Tandospirone also showed potential immunotoxic effects (probability 0.73). These findings underscore the importance of receptor conformation in 5-HT1A ligand binding and can inform structure-guided optimization to enhance efficacy while reducing CNS-related adverse effects. Overall, this comparative study provides a starting point for the design of next-generation serotonergic therapeutics for mood and anxiety disorders.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PCLIPtools: A Robust Framework for Identifying RNA-Protein Interaction Sites from PAR-CLIP experiments.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Polash, A. H., Hafner, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> PAR-CLIP is a widely used method for identifying binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) transcriptome-wide. A characteristic T-to-C transition in the sequenced cDNA pinpoints the site of RBP-RNA crosslinking and is induced by the use of a photoreactive uridine analogue, 4-thiouridine (4SU). As with other systems-wide methods, PAR-CLIP, too, is prone to false discoveries as the T-to-C signal might result from systematic noise, pre-existing SNPs, and PCR errors. Therefore, rigorous statistical methods are required for analyzing PAR-CLIP data. The few existing tools to analyze PAR-CLIP data lack updates and sufficient documentation, and often fail to process current higher-depth sequencing data. Here we report PCLIPtools, a lightweight, customizable suite for analyzing PAR-CLIP data. PCLIPtools considers the read depth, T-to-C transitions, and the other mutations to statistically estimate high-confidence interaction sites. Benchmarking shows that PCLIPtools identifies more functionally significant targets than the current standard tool, PARalyzer, without losing high-confidence sites and outperforming it in runtime. Exploratory analyses show PCLIPtools' specific targets are enriched for read depth and T-to-C conversion, supporting their validity. With simplicity, robustness, and speed, PCLIPtools improves the precision of PAR-CLIP data analysis while being accessible to experimental RNA biologists. PCLIPtools can be found on github (https://github.com/paulahsan/pcliptools).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fucoidan exerts anti-cancer activity in a 3D prostate spheroid cell culture model.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vider, J., Shelper, T. B., +2 authors, West, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To investigate the effect of fucoidan on the viability, migration and mRNA/microRNA profiles of two prostate cancer cell lines in 3D culture (spheroids). Hormone resistant, PC-3, and hormone sensitive, LNCaP, spheroids were incubated in the presence of a proprietary fucoidan blend extract from Undaria pinnatifida and Fucus vesiculosus. Magnetic bioprinting was used to assess cells' migration/metastatic potential in response to fucoidan exposure. Cellular viability was assessed using a cytotoxicity lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. nCounter (Nanostring) assays were used for microRNA and mRNA profiling in control and treated cells. Fucoidan treated PC-3 spheroids clearly showed a dose dependent viability/migration response and changes in spheroid structural morphology. Fifty-seven genes were significantly differentially expressed between fucoidan treated and non-treated PC-3 spheroids. No miRNAs at an adjusted p-value were significantly differentially expressed in PC-3 spheroids with fucoidan co-culture. Thirty-two genes were significantly differentially expressed in the fucoidan treated to non-treated LNCaP spheroids and there was a significant 3.5-fold (pAdj=0.012) increase in hsa-miR-1246 in the fucoidan treated compared to non-treated LNCaP spheroids. Gene sets enriched in fucoidan treated PC-3 spheroids related to DNA repair processes, cellular development, cell cycle and inflammation. These findings provide further pre-clinical evidence for a role for fucoidan in targeting cancer related pathways in both hormone sensitive and hormone resistant prostate cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TRIB2 supports a high glycolytic phenotype in melanoma cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mayoral, V., Coelho, A. L. D. S., +5 authors, Link, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metabolic adaptation plays a crucial role in driving the progression of human melanoma contributing to therapy resistance and disease relapse. The pseudo serine/threonine kinase Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) is prominently expressed in melanoma tissue, promoting resistance to anti-cancer treatments and correlating with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Despite this understanding, the impact of TRIB2 expression on melanoma's metabolic profile remains unexplored. Here we use UACC-62 melanoma cells which exhibit substantial endogenous expression of TRIB2 as well as engineered isogenic TRIB2 knock out (KO) cells to assess the effect of the loss of TRIB2 on metabolism. Our findings reveal that TRIB2-KO cells display reduced glycolytic activity and heightened vulnerability to pharmacological inhibition of oxidative metabolism, contrasting with the parental cell line. These metabolic and phenotypic changes are driven by coordinated regulation of multiple glycolytic genes, whose combined effect might produce the glycolytic phenotype observed in parental cells. Collectively, our results underscore an important role of TRIB2 as a modulator of the metabolic shift implicated in therapy resistance. These insights highlight TRIB2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention, aiming to counteract the metabolic adaptations driving melanoma's resistance mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Conserved Gαq-PLCβ-PKC signaling mediates trametinib resistance in BRAFV600E melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ke, J., Wang, Z., +2 authors, Li, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oncogenic mutations in BRAF, most commonly V600E, drive constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway in ~50% of melanomas. While MEK inhibitors such as trametinib, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors, are clinically effective, their therapeutic effects are restricted due to the development of drug resistance. Here we establish a Caenorhabditis elegans model carrying the oncogenic lin-45(V627E) allele, functionally equivalent to human BRAF(V600E), to investigate mechanisms of trametinib resistance. Genetic suppressor screening and transcriptomic profiling reveal that the EGL-30/Gq-PLC{beta}-PKC axis promotes resistance by sustaining MAPK activity under MEK blockade. Pharmacological inhibition of PLC{beta} or PKC synergizes with trametinib to abolish MAPK signaling and restore drug sensitivity in worms. Importantly, this resistance mechanism is conserved in human melanoma: combined MEK and Gq-PLC{beta}-PKC inhibition markedly enhances trametinib efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells and xenografts, and reverses acquired resistance in trametinib-resistant melanoma sublines. Together, our results identify a conserved Gq-PLC{beta}-PKC pathway as a driver of trametinib resistance and provide preclinical evidence for its co-targeting with MEK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Syngeneic Immunocompetent Mouse Model of Gallbladder Cancer Reveals Tumorigenesis and Therapeutic Response</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qiu, W., Ni, X., +13 authors, Liu, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare but highly lethal malignancy with one of the poorest prognoses among cancers of the digestive system cancers. However, current experimental models of GBC face critical limitations, particularly their dependence on immunodeficient hosts, which precludes the investigation of the tumor microenvironment.We aimed to establish a novel syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model that recapitulates human GBC and enables the investigation of tumor-immune interactions. Methods: We engineered a murine cell line (mGBC1-ZH) from normal mouse gallbladder organoids expressing Kras and Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) mutations. Tumorigenic potential of mGBC1-ZH was evaluated by subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation. RNA-Seq and WES was used to demonstrate its characterization and similarity with human GBC. Immunohistochemistry, CCK8, and transwell assays were used to investigate the role of CXCL5 in GBC. Therapeutic responses to standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated in the syngeneic GBC model. Results: This model supports both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth in immunocompetent C57BL/6J hosts while preserving hallmark features of human GBC, including biliary epithelial differentiation (CK7+/CK19+), aggressive histopathology, and an immunosuppressive "cold" tumor microenvironment. Genomic characterization revealed recurrent chromosomal instability and copy number alterations mirroring human GBC.Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling revealed profound gene expression changes during the model development, and resembled transcriptional features between mGBC1-ZH and human GBC cell lines and samples. CXCL5 was found to be upregulated in human GBC, and promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Functional validation of the syngeneic GBC model demonstrated therapeutic responsiveness to frontline chemotherapeutics gemcitabine and cisplatin with significant in vivo tumor regression. Conclusions: In summary, we established a novel syngeneic GBC mouse model, overcoming the limitations of traditional models by enabling studies in immunocompetent hosts. This model provides valuable insights into the molecular evolution from normal gallbladder cells to transformed cancer cells and establishes a robust platform for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, particularly for immunotherapy approaches.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Korah, M., Agolia, J. P., +31 authors, Delitto, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is an orphan disease that frequently recurs and metastasizes, with patients undergoing multiple lines of chemotherapy due to lack of effective therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis to comprehensively profile ULMS. We uncovered eight subtypes of tumor cells, including stem cell-like hormone receptor-positive cells, tumor cells with mesenchyme-like features, ischemic tumor cells defined by a MYC program, and inflammatory tumor cells with active interferon signaling. The spatial correlates of these tumor cell subtypes demonstrated unique localization patterns. By correlating these signatures to bulk RNA sequencing data, we demonstrate the scalability of these findings to clinical outcomes. Finally, using the single-cell integration and drug response prediction algorithm, we derive previously undescribed drug predictions targeting specific tumor subtypes that may be more efficacious than existing adjuvant regimens. Our findings highlight new individualized and multifaceted therapeutic avenues to treat ULMS.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Post-treatment recovery of docetaxel-treated prostate cancer monolayer and spheroid culture</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Swanson, S., McKenna, C. B., +1 author, Osei, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the last half-century, it has become widely recognized that small 3D aggregates of cancer cells called tumor spheroids mimic some aspects of tumor behavior. Cell culture geometry has been shown to influence drug pharmacokinetics, delivery, and resistance. Despite the improved physiological relevance, the laborious nature of spheroids has limited clonogenic measurement and longitudinal observation of post-treatment recovery in docetaxel-treated prostate tumor spheroids. Agent-based modeling can complement spheroid experiments by probing questions of interest that are experimentally inaccessible. Here, we performed proliferation and clonogenic assays in docetaxel-treated PC3 cells cultured in monolayers and spheroids to assess and compare end-of-treatment survival and post-treatment recovery. We observed growth stimulation with no survival benefit in low dose docetaxel-treated monolayer and spheroid culture. However, agent-based modeling suggested that this hormetic effect may have been influenced by the active process of apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clonogenic measurement of docetaxel-treated spheroid culture and longitudinal observation of post-treatment docetaxel-dose dependent effects in prostate cancer cell culture.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biologically explainable multi-omics feature demonstrates greater learning potential by identifying tissue of origin, stages, and subtypes for pan-cancer classification.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sana Munquad, Bikash Kumar Dash, +3 authors, Asim Bikas Das</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, which can invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant organs. Most of the conventional methods of diagnosis fails to identify the primary organ when cancer spreads to other organs, thereby adding another level of complexity for cancer detection. It is also critical to determine the stages and subtypes of cancer, and develop a clinically applicable model for precision therapy. With a dataset of 7632 samples from 30 different cancer originating from distinct organs, we have constructed a deep learning framework to solve all of these challenges. We have applied a hybrid feature selection method to identify cancer-associated features in the transcriptome, methylome, and microRNA datasets. This was achieved by combining both gene set enrichment analysis and Cox regression analysis to build an explainable AI model. We performed the early integration using an autoencoder to embed the cancer-associated multi-omics data into a lower-dimensional space; an ANN classifier was constructed using the latent features. In addition to correctly classifying 30 different cancer types by their tissue of origin, our framework also identifies individual subtypes and stages of cancer with an accuracy ranging from 87.31% to 94.0% and 83.33% to 93.64%, respectively. The current model demonstrates higher accuracy even when tested with external datasets, and shows better stability and accuracy in making predictions compared to the existing models. This approach offers explainable strategies for selecting features in AI-based prediction of tumor types for personalized therapy, aiding clinicians in making real-time treatment decisions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transforming microfluidics for single-cell analysis with robotics and artificial intelligence.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jinxiong Cheng, Rajiv Anne, Yu-Chih Chen</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell analysis has advanced biomedical research by revealing cellular heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution, identifying rare subpopulations that drive disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Microfluidics is central to this advancement, enabling precise single-cell isolation, manipulation, and cellular profiling. However, limitations in automation, reliability, and technical barriers hinder the widespread adoption of microfluidic single-cell analysis. This review highlights key innovations in experimental methods and deep learning-driven data analysis to overcome these challenges. Operating microfluidics with robotic operation, digital microfluidics, or microrobots enhances experimental precision and scalability. Beyond experimental automation, deep learning revolutionizes data interpretation through label-free image processing and cell status classification and regression. Generative models further refine analysis by correcting batch effects and generating synthetic datasets, improving accuracy and reproducibility in single-cell studies. Considering the complexity of integrating these technologies, remote shared cloud labs represent a potential pathway toward standardized and high-throughput single-cell analysis, facilitating broader access to advanced experimental workflows. Overall, the convergence of robotics and artificial intelligence in single-cell analysis will change data acquisition, hypothesis testing, and model refinement, driving breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine. While implementation remains challenging, this paradigm shift is transforming biomedical research, enabling unprecedented precision, scalability, and data-driven innovation.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Faley SL, Boghdeh NA, +5 authors, Brown JA.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human microphysiological systems, such as organs on chips, are an emerging technology for modeling human physiology in a preclinical setting to understand the mechanism of action of drugs, to evaluate the efficacy of treatment options for human disease and impairment, and to assess drug toxicity. By using human cells co-cultured in three-dimensional constructs, organ chips can provide greater fidelity to the human cellular condition than their two-dimensional predecessors. However, with the rise of SARS-CoV-2 and the global COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that many microphysiological systems were not compatible with or optimized for studies of infectious disease and operation in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) environment. Given that one of the early sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the airway, we created a human airway organ chip that could operate in a BSL-3 space with high throughput and minimal manipulation, while retaining the necessary physical and physiological components to recapitulate tissue response to infectious agents and the immune response to infection.</p>
