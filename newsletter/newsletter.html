<h2 class="paper-title">Protein large language model assisted one-to-one gene homology mapping in cross-species single-cell transcriptome integration</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kuang, Z.-Y., Sun, Y.-C., +1 author, Wu, H.-J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cross-species integration of single-cell transcriptomes requires establishing gene correspondences to enable comparative analysis of expression profiles across organisms. Current approaches predominantly rely on Ensembl homology tables, whose default many-to-many mappings often amplify gene-family effects and introduce artifactual micro-clusters that lack clear cell-type identity, thereby complicating biological interpretation. While restricting mappings to a one-to-one scheme suppresses such artifacts, it reduces the number of homology gene pairs by approximately 8% ([~]900 pairs). To address this limitation, we developed a protein large language model (pLLM)-based gene homology mapping strategy that boosts the number of homology gene pairs. By integrating pLLM-derived representations with sequence similarity, we constructed a fused mapping approach, which achieved top performance in a comprehensive benchmark based on a curated cross-species atlas -- spanning nine datasets, 11 species, and over 3.2 million cells. Our method further identifies previously unannotated cell-type marker pairs, facilitating novel cross-species marker discovery. These results establish a robust framework for gene homology mapping in cross-species transcriptome integration, improving both accuracy and biological interpretability.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Direct Genome Transfer from Acholeplasma laidlawii to Yeast</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nucifora, D. P., Saini, T. S., Karas, B. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cloning bacterial genomes in yeast or other hosts is a crucial step in workflows for creating highly engineered strains. The genome of Acholeplasma laidlawii can be cloned in yeast if a toxic gene is removed, but this deletion has not been tested in live bacteria. Here, we demonstrate cloning the 1.46 Mb genome of A. laidlawii strain DN-E by integrating a yeast vector into the toxic gene and transferring the genome directly to yeast using cell fusion. Genomic integration was only possible when A. laidlawii was complemented with a functional recA gene. Following cell fusion, 13 out of 20 screened yeast colonies contained the A. laidlawii genome, as determined by multiplex PCR. This is the first demonstration showing cloning entire A. laidlawii genomes by simply mixing donor and recipient cells in fusion buffer, bringing us one step closer to creating fully synthetic Acholeplasma strains.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GlueFinder: A Data-Driven Framework for the Rational Discovery of Molecular Glues</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Skolnick, J., Srinivasan, B., Zhou, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular glues can drive targeted protein degradation by stabilizing ternary complexes between proteins of interest and E3 ubiquitin ligases, but rational design has lagged due to limited rules for interface recognition and an overreliance on a few ligases (e.g., VHL or Cereblon). We introduce GlueFinder, a systematic, unbiased platform that leverages structural bioinformatics to mine the Protein Data Bank for ligand binding pockets adjacent to the protein interface which are ligandable sites near protein-protein interfaces that can nucleate glue-mediated complex formation. After validating its performance on a benchmark of experimentally solved dimeric structures with known and predicted glues, we applied GlueFinder to three therapeutically important targets, EGFR, HER2, and KRAS, and predicted candidate glues that recruit 24, 111, and 148 distinct E3 ligases to these targets, respectively. We further demonstrate that GlueFinder can promote the formation of non-native EGFR complexes, possibly enabling ternary assemblies that would not form on their own. Together, these results establish a general, computation-guided strategy for molecular glue discovery that decouples design from legacy degrader scaffolds and specific ligase dependencies, expands the usable E3 ligase repertoire, and enables rational targeting of interfacial binding pockets. GlueFinder thus broadens both the scope and precision of targeted protein degradation and moves the field toward mechanism-driven, systematic glue development across diverse therapeutic contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatial transcriptomics of glioblastoma defines biologically and clinically significant reprogramming patterns across unique spatial microenvironments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ravikumar, V., Kulkarni, R., +2 authors, Al-Holou, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Advances in therapy are hindered by the complex intratumoral heterogeneity of GBM, where distinct malignant and non-malignant cellular states and interactions exist in spatially defined niches of the tumor microenvironment (TME), shaping both tumor behavior and treatment response. In this work, we define GBM biological reprogramming, TME recomposition, and cell-cell interactions in relation to spatially well defined Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project regions. Further, we apply a novel spatially informed approach to integrate biological reprogramming, as identified through gene co-expression network modules, with specific changes in cell-cell communications. Our results validate prior findings and offer novel insights into the spatial patterning of transcription factor regulation, cellular interactions, and biological pathway activity, in addition to informing rational combination therapies targeting spatial niche specific vulnerabilities. In addition, our work contributes a novel Visium spatial transcriptomics dataset of 14 samples for use by the GBM research community.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ZebraTrack: An Open-Source Object Detection Algorithm to Detect and Track Larval Zebrafish Motor Touch Responses</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lacroix, A. C., Armstrong, G. A. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a model organism used for the study of vertebrate development, disease and drug discovery. Two-day old larval zebrafish exhibit burst swimming behaviour that can be elicited by a light touch to the tail. Larval motor touch-responses are frequently video recorded and later analyzed. Methods to robustly analyze these videos in a reproducible and time-efficient manner are reliant on manual tracking, which is prone to experimenter bias and error. Here we present ZebraTrack, a machine learning-based program, which employs Ultralytics YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) object detection algorithm to automatically analyze larval touch response videos. The program breaks down video files into their constituent frames and passes these through a custom-trained YOLOv8n algorithm to detect the presence of a single larval zebrafish. ZebraTrack then refines the tracking data output by the model and tabulates it into an excel spreadsheet. The program then computes and extracts four relevant swim metrics: swim duration (s), swim distance (mm), mean swim velocity (mm/s), and max swim velocity (mm/s). ZebraTrack rapidly accelerates the analysis process, while also eliminating the errors associated with manual tracking. Furthermore, it allows for high-throughput analysis of larval touch response videos and can detect subtle differences in motor metrics arising as a result of temperature differences, demonstrating that utility of this tracking algorithm. ZebraTrack is available for download at https://github.com/Armstrong-Lab-70/ZebraTrack.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BERT-T6: Towards High-accuracy T6SS Bacterial Toxin Identification Using Protein Language Model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mo, X., Cai, J., Siu, S. W. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Type VI secretion system effectors target the cell wall, membranes and nucleic acids, leading to the killing of bacteria or impairment of host cell defense mechanisms. Accurate identification of T6SEs will be beneficial to understand the virulence of these bacteria via type VI secretion systems as well as bacterial pathogenesis. Although some traditional machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools have been developed to distinguish T6SEs from non-T6SEs, we believe there is still room for further improvement. To obtain the robust feature for model construction, we successively investigate various classic sequence-based features and embeddings from pre-trained transformer-based protein language models. Building upon the model incorporating ProtBert embeddings, we employed a transfer learning approach to fine-tune the ProtBert protein language model with a downstream T6SE classification task. The resulting BERT-T6 model demonstrates performance significantly superior to baseline models. More importantly, with an accuracy of 0.959, a sensitivity of 0.909, a specificity of 0.973, a precision of 0.905, a F1-score of 0.907, MCC of 0.881, our model achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art binary and multi-class predictors. This work highlights the effectiveness of utilizing BERT with transfer learning for T6SE prediction. BERT-T6 provides a robust and precise approach for identifying T6SEs, offering promise for enhancing studies of bacterial virulence mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Non-Intrusive Computer Vision Framework for Real-Time Vital Sign Digitization and Adaptive Drug Infusion in Critical Care Environments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mehendale, N., Chikhale, A. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: This work proposes a computer vision framework to automate the extraction of vital signs from bedside monitor systems and facilitate adaptive drug infusion in intensive care units (ICUs). This approach is intended to meet the requirement for less manual intervention and improved accuracy in critical care settings. Methods: An 8-megapixel camera captures time-lapse images of a simulated monitor display at a rate of 3 frames per second. Images are preprocessed (grayscale conversion, histogram stretching, edge detection, color filtering) before Tesseract OCR reads out vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure). On a synthetic dataset of 3,000 vital sign images, the system achieved 99.87% accuracy. Retrieved information inputs a pre-programmed fuzzy logic controller to adjust syringe pump infusion rates of medications like norepinephrine. The system is designed for non-invasive integration with existing monitors. Results: OCR accuracy improved from 95.43% (without preprocessing) to 99.87% on the test dataset. An optimal focal distance of 11.9 cm was determined, balancing accuracy and compactness. The fuzzy logic controller provided stepwise adjustment of flow rate based on blood pressure thresholds, with simulations using non-biological substitutes demonstrating predictable control around a 3 ml/hour baseline. Conclusion: This framework offers a promising proof-of-concept for ICU automation, with potential extensions to other monitoring areas. The primary limitation is the lack of human trials and validation in a clinical environment, implying the necessity for future clinical validation before any real-world application can be considered.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Studying the interactions between antibodies and antigens is fundamental to the development of novel therapeutic biologics. Predictions of such interactions start with data collection. Though there exist reliable resources to identify antibody structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), such data still requires substantial processing to be usable in predictive tasks. Redundancy in sequences needs to be removed to avoid data leakages between train, test and validation sets. Descriptors such as surface accessibility, secondary structure and antibody region information need to be additionally annotated. Information on inter- and intra-molecular contacts, which is crucial to studying paratope/epitope information, needs to be collected. The specialized immunoglobulin format of Nanobodies(R) requires a separate dataset mirroring that of antibodies, given that their structure contains only a single VHH chain. Because antibody-antigen structures account for a small amount of all protein-protein contacts, having a molecular contact reference from other proteins is also desired. To address these issues, we introduce NAStructuralDB (https://naturalantibody.com/na-structural/), a dataset of processed structures of antibodies, Nanobodies(R), proteins and their complexes with molecular contact information and associated annotations. We use the opportunity of having collected the contact data to provide a reference of binding propensities of different residues across distinct contact types. We anticipate that this dataset will accelerate a broad range of predictive tasks by standardizing common, time-consuming data preparation steps in antibody and protein design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AbTune: Layer-wise selective fine-tuning of protein language models for antibodies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, X., Bonvin, A. M. J. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibodies play crucial roles in immune defense and serve as key therapeutic agents for numerous diseases. The structural and sequence diversity of their antigen recognition loops, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality data, pose significant challenges in the development of generalizable predictive models. Here, we present a sequence specific fine-tuning strategy for antibodies that partially bypass the need for generalization. We evaluated this approach in three biologically relevant tasks: antibody structure prediction, zero-shot prediction of beneficial mutation in antibody-antigen complexes and binding affinity prediction. In all three tasks, we observed substantial improvements over pLM baselines without fine-tuning, while using only a fraction of the computational and time resources required for fully fine-tuning antibody-specific pLMs. We further extended our method to layer-wise selective fine-tuning, with the aim of investigating how model size, fine-tuning duration, and fine-tuning depth collectively influence downstream performance. Fine-tuning 50-75% of LoRA layers was found to be optimal for small- to medium-sized pLMs, with the initial perplexity of each sequence providing some guidance for determining the best fine-tuning duration. Building on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting beneficial mutations and binding affinity. These results establish our layer-wise selective, sequence specific fine-tuning strategy as an efficient and practical strategy for antibody-related prediction tasks, providing a useful protocol for future applications in immunology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Solving the gene classification problem with a novel Gene Space approach</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zaytsev, K. S., Bogatyreva, N. S., Fedorov, A. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genomic organization and its comparative analysis throughout all major kingdoms of life are extensively studied across multiple scales, ranging from individual gene-level analyses to system-wide investigations. This work introduces a novel framework for characterizing genetic architecture through a new integral genomic parameter. We propose the concept of a multidimensional Gene Space to enable holistic quantification of genome organization principles. Gene Space - a multidimensional space based on the frequencies of nucleotide tokens, such as individual nucleotides, codons, or codon pairs. We demonstrate that in this space, genes from each of the studied microorganism species occupy a limited region, and individual genes from different species can be effectively separated. Consequently, a specific Genome Subspace can be defined for each species, which constrains the organism's evolutionary pathways, thereby determining the constraints on gene optimization for these species. Further in- depth analysis is required to test if it's true for other organisms as well. The Gene Space framework offers a novel and powerful approach for genome analysis at the most basic levels, with promising applications in comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, and gene optimization.</p>
