<h2 class="paper-title">A PLM-Based Method for Predicting Protein Ion Channel Modulators for Drug Discovery and Safety Evaluation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rathore, A. S., Jain, S., +1 author, Raghava, G. P. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ion channels are central to regulating neuronal communication, cardiac rhythm, and muscle contraction. Their modulation can induce therapeutic benefits but may also lead to adverse or toxic effects. This study presents IonNTXpred, a protein language model (PLM)-based method for predicting protein ion channel modulators, including channel-specific (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and others) and moonlighting proteins capable of modulating multiple ion channels. We train, test, and evaluate our models on the largest dataset of non-redundant ion channel modulating proteins, where no two proteins have more than 40% sequence identity. Composition analysis revealed that residues Cys, Gly, and Trp are highly prevalent, whereas Ala, Glu, Leu, Gln, and Val are scarce in ion channel modulating proteins, with Cys identified as a key discriminative residue. We explored both alignment-based (BLAST, MERCI) and alignment-free (machine learning, deep learning, and PLM-based) approaches. Among these, our evolutionary information-based PLM (ESM2-t33) achieved the best performance, with an AUROC of 0.97 across ion channels, which further improved to 0.98 when integrated with BLAST output. The proposed method outperformed existing approaches on independent datasets. We used IonNTXpred to screen FDA-approved and organismal proteins to identify candidates with ion channel modulating potential, supporting drug repurposing, discovery of new therapeutic proteins, and safety assessment of existing biologics. We implemented these models in a user-friendly web server, IonNTXpred, which facilitates the design and discovery of ion channel modulating protein-based drugs and supports the biosafety evaluation of therapeutic proteins through neurotoxin screening (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ionntxpred/).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Single-component optogenetic control enables human portrait formation in cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yilmaz-Atay, F., Kocoglu, M., +3 authors, Ozturk, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Continued exploration of novel photoreceptors is essential for advancing optogenetic tools, as differences in their reaction mechanisms and spectral sensitivity could enhance the versatility of available systems. While circadian clock photoreceptors represent promising candidates, only Arabidopsis Cryptochrome 2 (AtCRY2) has been widely adopted in current applications. Notably, both the light-dependent interaction of AtCRY2 with the CIB1 protein and its homodimerization have been exploited for diverse optogenetic applications. In our search for alternative circadian photoreceptors for optogenetic control, we aimed to develop a system functioning without the co-expression of interacting partners. In this context, Drosophila Cryptochrome (DmCRY) was a promising candidate due to its well-characterized photoreceptor function and defined light-dependent reaction mechanism. Upon illumination, DmCRY undergoes a conformational change that enables interactions with Jetlag and Timeless proteins, facilitating circadian clock resetting. DmCRY is also targeted for degradation via ubiquitylation by Jetlag and/or BRWD3, ensuring resetting occurs only once each morning. Notably, DmCRY is susceptible to light-induced degradation even when expressed in mammalian cells. Leveraging this property, we fused the Tet repressor (TetR) to the C-terminus of DmCRY to enable light-dependent regulation of gene expression via TetR-responsive elements. We demonstrate that this system modulates expression of Cas9 for gene knockout, dCas9 for transcriptional regulation, and recombinant proteins. Furthermore, using these tools with a photomasking technique, we generated human portrait images from cultured cells. These findings highlight DmCRY as a versatile optogenetic tool capable of controlling cellular processes with standard visible light, with potential for novel optogenetic platforms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Benchmarking Framework to Catalyze Individual Human Genome Projects</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kalpande, M., Ganesh, A., Srinivasan, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Individual human genome projects still aim for chromosome-level gapless assemblies, which rely on high-coverage reads from multiple long-read sequencing platforms using a multiplicity of assembly pipelines. Moreover, the dependence on DNA derived from primary cell lines for these assemblies makes such projects prohibitively expensive to scale for individual genome initiatives and to catalyze clinical applications. Over the past decades, genome assembly quality has advanced remarkably from draft assemblies in the early 2010s, to chromosome-level assemblies using error-prone long reads in the late 2010s, to the recent T2T gapless assemblies enabled by high-quality next-generation long-read technologies. That said, a systematic evaluation of trade-offs from assemblies obtained at various coverages, starting at 3x, from a single long-read sequencing platform, is critical for developing a cost-effective and practical strategy for catalyzing individual genome initiative. Here, by assembling contigs at various coverage levels through downsampling of existing PacBio HiFi reads from three individuals, we demonstrate that high-quality assemblies, as measured by standard assembly metrics and DNA-level linearity relative to a reference across most chromosomes (developed inhouse), can be achieved at approximately 12x coverage. Interestingly, starting at coverages as low as 6x, assembly metrics, including BUSCO scores and DNA-level linearity, begin to saturate, suggesting minimal trade-offs. Furthermore, we show that known structural variants (e.g., the 8p23.1 inversion) can be reliably identified even at 6x coverage. Together, these results suggest that cost-effective strategies can be developed to advance individual genome initiatives potentially from PacBio HiFi reads from a single SMRT cell per human genome.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Conjugation-mediated DNA delivery to the filamentous fungus Ustilago maydis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jaafar, T., Jaafar, A., +1 author, Karas, B. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phytopathogenic fungi are ubiquitous throughout the environment and threaten global food security. This issue is further amplified by the increasing resistance of pathogens to antimicrobials. Current chemical-based antifungals target cells by inhibiting growth or metabolic function, making them ideal for fungal gain of resistance mutations. Biofungicides are a rising class of antifungals that have low potential for negative environmental impact and provide the fungi almost no potential for gaining resistance. Conjugative plasmids which play a role in the natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. In this work, we have demonstrated the first protocol for delivering DNA from Escherichia coli to the filamentous phytopathogen, Ustilago maydis through conjugation. DNA delivery was confirmed using PCR screening of DNA isolated from the re-streaked transconjugants. Although challenges such as reduced conjugation efficiency and extrachromosomal replication persist, this work establishes the first step towards creating a conjugation-based biofungicide.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">E1: Retrieval-Augmented Protein Encoder Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jain, S., Beazer, J., +2 authors, Madani, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large language models trained on natural proteins learn powerful representations of protein sequences that are useful for downstream understanding and prediction tasks. Because they are only exposed to individual protein sequences during pretraining without any additional contextual information, conventional protein language models suffer from parameter inefficiencies in learning, baked-in phylogenetic biases, and functional performance issues at larger scales. To address these challenges, we have built Profluent-E1, a family of retrieval-augmented protein language models that explicitly condition on homologous sequences. By integrating retrieved evolutionary context through block-causal multi-sequence attention, E1 captures both general and family-specific constraints without fine-tuning. We train E1 models on four trillion tokens from the Profluent Protein Atlas and achieve state-of-the-art performance across zero-shot fitness and unsupervised contact-map prediction benchmarks -- surpassing alternative sequence-only models. Performance scales with model size from 150M to 600M parameters, and E1 can be used flexibly in single-sequence or retrieval-augmented inference mode for fitness prediction, variant ranking, and embeddings for structural tasks. To encourage open science and further development in retrieval-augmented protein language models, we release three models for free research and commercial use at https://github.com/Profluent-AI/E1.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A dual-metric framework for quantifying the biological fidelity of scRNA-seq pipelines</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Su, Q., Long, Y., +1 author, Lian, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution transcriptional profiling, but early-stage processing pipelines differ markedly in barcode recovery, UMI correction, and read assignment-variations that can propagate and bias downstream analyses. We present a reproducible, parameter-aware benchmarking framework to quantify the biological fidelity of four primary pipelines-STARsolo, Cell Ranger, Kallisto|Bustools, and Alevin-fry-across simulated ground-truth datasets and complex biological contexts, including a Huntington's disease (HD) mouse model. Our approach introduces two complementary metrics: the Cluster Annotation Score (CAS), assessing concordance between direct cell-level and cluster-level consensus labels, and the Marker Concordance Score (MCS), measuring cohesion of de novo marker genes per cell type. By systematically varying highly variable gene (n_HVG) and principal component (n_PC) settings, we map how upstream quantification interacts with downstream parameter choice. Simulations show STARsolo and Kallisto|Bustools deliver high technical accuracy, but only STARsolo consistently preserves stable cell identities and coherent marker expression across parameter regimes. In empirical datasets, alignment-based pipelines (STARsolo, Cell Ranger) yield higher CAS/MCS values and more biologically faithful annotations, while alignment-free methods show reduced signal fidelity despite faster runtimes. Differences introduced during primary processing persist after batch correction and integration, altering disease-associated cell type detection. Our open-source CAS-MCS-Scoring toolkit enables transparent evaluation of pipeline performance, providing a practical guide for selecting analysis strategies that maximize reproducibility and biological interpretability in scRNA-seq studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CycleGRN: Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks from Cyclic Flow Dynamics in Single-Cell RNA-seq</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhao, W., Fertig, E. J., Stein-O'Brien, G. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oscillatory processes such as the cell cycle play critical roles in cell fate determination and disease development, yet existing gene regulatory network (GRN) inference methods often fail to account for their dynamic nature. We propose CycleGRN, a novel framework that treats cell cycle gene expression observations as an invariant measure of a stochastic differential equation and learns from data a dynamical system that fits cycling biological processes. Using a directed graph constructed along the inferred flow field in the cell space, we estimate Lie derivatives for all genes, enabling velocity inference beyond the cell cycle subspace. To quantify regulatory interactions, we introduce a time-lagged correlation operator between any pair of genes supported on the flow-aligned directed graph, which respects the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold and allows temporal ordering consistent with the underlying oscillatory process. The method requires only raw gene expression data at single-cell resolution and a list of cycle genes, without temporal binning or splicing dynamics. We evaluate our method on four synthetic datasets generated from mechanistic models with known network structures with oscillatory subnetworks, and on a mouse retinal progenitor single-cell RNA-seq dataset spanning three cell types and a knockout condition. Across all settings, our method outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its ability to recover causal and oscillatory interactions from static single-cell RNA-seq datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrated microdroplet workflow for high-throughput cell-free transcription in double emulsion picoreactors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Totlani, K., Khan, E. A., +2 authors, Stokke, B. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-molecule nucleic acid assays offer a powerful route to understand gene regulation. To enable rapid and precise characterization of regulatory sequences such as promoters within a pool of synthetic 5' regulatory sequences, we present an integrated microdroplet workflow for high-throughput cell-free transcription in double emulsion (DE) picoreactors. For this, we utilize the T7 promoter as a positive control and the Mango III RNA aptamer for fluorescent readout of transcription in an in vitro setup. First, DNA templates are compartmentalized into picolitre droplets along with rolling circle amplification reagents and incubated off-chip. The resulting emulsion is then reinjected into a second device that integrates three operations on a single chip : (i) emulsion reinjection, (ii) electric-field-mediated StepInjection of IVT reagents and (iii) downstream water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsification. Post IVT incubation, the fluorescent DE droplets are selectively isolated by FACS, enabling sorting as well as the classification of droplets on the basis of their fluorescent intensities. We characterize the workflow with proof-of-principle experiments with three input DNA concentrations that yield distinct fractions of fluorescent DEs and also demonstrate intensity-based binning and indexed sorting of droplets into defined wells of a microtiter plate. This workflow establishes a practical route to high-throughput, single-template transcription assays in FACS compatible double emulsions and provides a foundation for future screening of synthetic regulatory libraries and promoter variants with fluorescence encoded readouts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Wasserstein Critics Outperform Discriminatorsin Adversarial Deconfounding of Gene Expression Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Reid, K., Guven, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-throughput gene expression measurements are biased by technical and biological confounding variables, which obscure true biological signals. A common deep-learning-based solution involves training latent-space models with adversarial regularizers to ignore information from confounding variables. These methods rely on discriminator-networks which are unstable to train, especially when confounding effects are strong, leading to issues like vanishing gradients. Inspired by Wasserstein GANs, we propose replacing the standard discriminator with a Wasserstein critic for this deconfounding task. We systematically compare the performance of a discriminator-based approach against a Wasserstein critic-based approach on a state-of-the-art deconfounding autoencoder architecture. We evaluate these methods on standard single-cell integration benchmark datasets and demonstrate that the Wasserstein critic significantly outperforms the discriminator in integration quality with marginal loss of biological fidelity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SCOUT: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck modelling of gene expression evolution on single-cell lineage trees</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Stuart, H., McKenna, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of clonal populations is essential for uncovering the principles of development, disease progression, and therapeutic resistance. Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing and transcriptomics enable such analyses by combining heritable barcodes with cell-state information. Here, we present SCOUT (single-cell Ornstein-Uhlenbeck trees), a framework that models gene expression dynamics along single-cell lineage trees using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to distinguish neutral drift from selective pressure. Using simulations, we demonstrate that SCOUT accurately classifies genes based on their underlying evolutionary models. We further validate SCOUT in Caenorhabditis elegans development, identifying biological processes under selection across distinct developmental contexts. Finally, we apply SCOUT to a lung adenocarcinoma xenograft model, revealing key regulators of metastatic progression and tumor microenvironmental adaptation. By integrating lineage and transcriptomic data, SCOUT provides a powerful evolutionary lens for dissecting the forces that shape cell fate.</p>

However, therapeutic resistance remains a major clinical challenge, necessitating the identification of new molecular targets. Myosin VI (MVI), a motor protein increasingly linked to cancer, directly interacts with the ER and plays a key role in the spatial regulation of RNA Polymerase II. Notably, expression levels of MVI and ER are positively correlated across breast cancer tissues. Here, we present a multidisciplinary investigation combining advanced imaging, genomic profiling, and phenotypic characterisation to elucidate the interplay between MVI and the ER. We demonstrate that MVI nuclear localisation is dynamically regulated by estrogen signalling and ER activity. Conversely, ER nuclear localisation requires active MVI, suggesting a reciprocal regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, MVI influences subnuclear architecture, modulating ER transcriptional activity and downstream gene expression programmes that govern cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MVI enhances the effect of hormone therapy, resulting in greater disruption of ER function than monotherapy alone. Moreover, MVI inhibition also suppresses the activity of hormone-resistant ER mutants, highlighting its potential to overcome therapy resistance. Our findings establish MVI as a critical regulator of ER nuclear dynamics and gene expression, supporting its candidacy as a novel therapeutic target in ER-positive breast cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Learning from All Views: A Multiview Contrastive Framework for Metabolite Annotation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhou Chen, Y., Hassoun, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metabolomics, enabled by high-throughput mass spectrometry, promises to advance our understanding of cellular biochemistry and guide new discoveries in disease mechanisms, drug development, and personalized medicine. However, as the assignment of molecular structures to measured spectra is challenging, annotation rates remain low and hinder potential advancements. We present MultiView Projection (MVP), a novel framework for learning a joint embedding space between molecules and spectra by leveraging multiple data views: molecular graphs, molecular fingerprints, spectra, and consensus spectra. MVP builds on contrastive multiview learning to capture mutual information across views, leading to more robust and generalizable representations for spectral annotation. Unlike prior approaches that consider multiple views via concatenation or as targets of auxiliary tasks, MVP learns from all views jointly, resulting in improved molecular candidate ranking. Notably, MVP supports annotation using either individual spectra or consensus spectra, enabling flexible use of multiple measurements. On the MassSpecGym benchmark, we show that annotation using query consensus spectra significantly outperforms rank aggregation strategies based on constituent spectrum annotation. Using the consensus spectrum view, MVP achieves 35.99% and 13.96% rank@1 when retrieving candidates by mass and formula, respectively. When ranking using individual spectra, MVP demonstrates performance that is superior to or on par with existing methods, achieving 26.37% and 11.10% rank@1 for candidates by mass and formula, respectively. MVP offers a flexible, extensible foundation for learning from multiple molecule/spectra data views.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Elucidating Neurodevelopmental Trajectories in Cancer with Topic Modeling: Revealing Persistent External Granule Layer Lineages in Medulloblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rajendran, A., Haldipur, P., +9 authors, Pattwell, S. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The cerebellar rhombic lip generates cerebellar progenitors and neurons that ultimately differentiate to comprise over half of all neurons in the adult human brain. Standard clustering approaches often fragment or miss rhombic lip progenitor populations entirely due to their transient nature, small size, and rapid state transitions, leaving fundamental questions unanswered about normal cerebellar development and how such processes may be hijacked in pediatric brain cancer. Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, affects approximately 500 children annually in the United States with overall survival rates varying dramatically by subgroup. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma, comprising 25-30% of cases, arises from rhombic lip-derived granule neuron precursors (GNP) within the external granule layer (EGL) and has particularly poor outcomes in several subtypes (5-year survival ~41%). Using our topic modeling framework on over one million fetal cerebellar nuclei, we identify proliferative rhombic lip and EGL states that bifurcate into distinct glial and neuronal lineages through intermediate progenitors and capture a portion of the developmental spectrum form outer EGL (oEGL) proliferation through inner EGL (iEGL) differentiation. These developmental signatures (topics) persist in medulloblastoma, validating GNP origins of SHH tumors and revealing age-specific molecular programs that correspond to distinct stages of EGL development within SHH subtypes. Our transferable framework enables systematic comparison of developmental and disease states across technologies without data integration, solving a fundamental challenge as genomic atlases expand.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Leveraging FracMinHash Containment for Genomic dN/dS</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rodriguez, J. S., Hera, M. R., Koslicki, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Increasing availability of genomic data demands algorithmic approaches that can efficiently and accurately conduct downstream genomic analyses. These analyses, such as evaluating selection pressures within and across genomes, can reveal developmental and environmental pressures. One such commonly used metric to measure evolutionary pressures is based on the ratio of non-synonymous and synonomous substitution rates, dN/dS. Conventionally, the dN/dS ratio is used to infer selection pressures employing alignments to estimate total non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates along protein-coding genes. However, this process can be time consuming and not scalable for larger datasets. Recently, a fast, approximate similarity measure, FracMinHash containment, was introduced and related to average nucleotide identity. In this work, we show how FracMinHash containment can be used to quickly estimate dN/dS enabling alignment-free estimations at a genomic level. Through simulated and real world experiments, our results indicate that employing FracMinHash containment to estimate $d_N/d_S$ is scalable, enabling pairwise dN/dS estimations for 85,205 genomes within 5 hours. Furthermore, our approach is comparable to traditional dN/dS methods, representing sequences subject to positive and negative selection across various mutation rates. Moreover, we used this model to evaluate signatures of selection between Archaeal and Bacterial genomes, identifying a previously unreported metabolic island between Methanobrevibacter sp. RGIG2411 and Candidatus Saccharibacteria bacterium RGIG2249.. We present, FracMinHash dN/dS, a novel alignment-free approach for estimating dN/dS at a genome level that is accurate and scalable beyond gene-level estimations while demonstrating comparability to conventional alignment-based dN/dS methods. Leveraging the alignment-free similarity estimation, FracMinHash containment, pairwise dN/dS estimations are facilitated within milliseconds, making it suitable for large-scale evolutionary analyses across diverse taxa. It supports comparative genomics, evolutionary inference, and functional interpretation across both synthetic, and complex biological datasets.

<h2 class="paper-title">Identifying SUMOylation-related genes in liver fibrosis with bioinformatics and experimental models for diagnostic insights.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhiwei Su, Yuxue Ding, +2 authors, Chunyan Ji</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liver fibrosis (LF) is a medical disorder caused by prolonged chronic liver injury, which, if left untreated, can progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer, posing significant risks to patient health. In recent years, the increase in liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis, has significantly heightened the prevalence of LF. SUMOylation, an important post-translational modification, is essential for regulating cellular functions and may play a critical role in the progression of LF; however, its exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study conducted a thorough examination of the expression patterns of SUMOylation-related genes in patients with LF for the first time. We obtained two LF datasets (GSE130970 and GSE84044) from the GEO database, integrated the data for DEG analysis and functional enrichment analysis, and employed machine learning techniques to identify pivotal genes. Furthermore, we utilized ssGSEA and immune cell infiltration analysis to evaluate the roles of these genes within the immunological context of LF. To validate the bioinformatics findings, we established a CCl₄-induced C57BL/6 mouse model of LF to investigate the expression of relevant genes. A total of 1,583 differentially expressed genes were identified, 13 of which were associated with SUMOylation. These genes were primarily enriched in biological processes related to cell signal transduction, cell adhesion, and inflammatory responses. Utilizing machine learning approaches, we found eight crucial genes (NR3C2, PCNA, THRB, CDKN2A, DNMT1, MDM2, SMC6, and RXRA) that have significant diagnostic potential in the progression of LF. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in the infiltration of several immune cell types, with evident correlations between the expression of SUMOylation-related genes and specific immune cell types. The results of the animal experiments validated the bioinformatics analysis, as key SUMOylation-related genes exhibited expression patterns consistent with our expectations in the CCl₄-induced LF mouse model. This study elucidates the critical roles of SUMOylation-related genes in LF, highlighting their influence on liver damage and the progression of fibrosis through the regulation of cytokine synthesis, facilitation of hepatic stellate cell activation, and enhancement of immune cell infiltration. The identified significant genes exhibit potential as novel biomarkers for therapeutic applications. These findings clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of SUMOylation in LF and establish a foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers, thereby aiding in the prevention and treatment of LF.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unified integration of spatial transcriptomics across platforms with LLOKI.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ellie Haber, Ajinkya Deshpande, +1 author, Spencer Krieger</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture and cellular interactions, but integrating ST data across platforms remains challenging due to differences in gene panels, data sparsity, and technical variability. Here, we introduce LLOKI, a novel framework for integrating imaging-based ST data from diverse platforms without requiring shared gene panels. LLOKI addresses ST integration through two key alignment tasks: feature alignment across technologies and batch alignment across data sets. Optimal transport-guided feature propagation adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references through graph-based imputation, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification, and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer data sets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels. Together, LLOKI provides a robust foundation for cross-platform ST studies, with the potential to scale to large atlas data sets, enabling deeper insights into cellular organization and tissue environments.</p>
