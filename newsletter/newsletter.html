<h2 class="paper-title">scMOBA: A conversational single-cell Multi-Omics Brain Agent across species</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wei, R., Zhang, Z., +9 authors, Sun, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell and spatial multi-omics are revolutionizing our understanding of the complexity in the developmental, aging, and diseased brain, but integrating this knowledge across modalities and species remains challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose scMOBA, a conversational single-cell Multi-Omics Brain Agent established by a large language model, a gene encoder, and a cross-attention projector. The scMOBA was pre-trained on 130 million single-cell and spatial multi-omics data spanning the entire brain across diverse species, development, aging and diseases. The pre-training utilized a novel multi-omics Feature-Question-Answer (FQA) paradigm, enabling the model to generate biological answers from feature inputs and textual queries. This unique scheme facilitates superior zero-shot inference capabilities without requiring additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that scMOBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained cell type classification across different species and modalities, as well as in batch correction and multi-omics data integration. Furthermore, scMOBA significantly boosts the accuracy of kinds of critical downstream tasks, including cell-type specific aging clock construction and disease status prediction. Overall, scMOBA serves as a powerful scientific discovery engine for multi-omics brain research, advancing the precision prediction and early intervention of neurological aging and diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modeling TCR-pMHC Binding with Dual Encoders and Cross-Attention Fusion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, W., Qi, C., Wei, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurately modeling the binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is essential for guiding immunotherapy development and personalized vaccine design. However, the vast diversity of TCR repertoires and the scarcity of experimentally validated interactions make generalization to unseen epitopes challenging. This paper proposes TIDE, a cross-attention-driven dual-encoder framework that leverages large protein and molecular language models to learn discriminative representations of TCRs and peptides. In TIDE, TCR sequences are encoded using Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), while peptides are transformed into SMILES strings and processed by MolFormer to capture chemical and structural properties. Multi-layer cross-attention then refines and integrates these embeddings, highlighting interaction-relevant patterns without requiring explicit structural alignment. Evaluated on the TCHard benchmark under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, TIDE achieves superior predictive accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR. These results demonstrate that combining pretrained language models with cross-attention fusion offers a powerful approach for TCR-pMHC binding prediction and paves the way for more reliable computational immunology applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DPCMHC: efficient prediction of MHC-peptide binding affinity by deep learning based on dual-padding convolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, Y., Mi, L., Zhang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting peptide binding affinities to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) is a crucial challenge in immunological bioinformatics and is essential for identifying neoantigens in personalized cancer vaccines. Current deep learning methods often struggle, especially with 10-mer and 11-mer peptides. To address this, we developed DPCMHC, an advanced deep learning model featuring an embedding module, a dual-padding convolutional module, a BiLSTM module, and an output module. This design enhances the model's understanding of amino acid sequences and their lengths. DPCMHC effectively captures the information on the beginning and end of amino acids, as well as the diverse sizes of adjacent amino acids. Using concatenation, the model extracts continuous sequence information. We rigorously evaluated DPCMHC on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior or comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our validation results confirm that DPCMHC is a robust and efficient tool for predicting MHC-peptide binding affinities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">bronko: ultrafast, alignment-free detection of viral genome variation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Doughty, R. D., Tisza, M. J., Treangen, T. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As viral sequencing datasets continue to grow, traditional alignment-based variant calling pipelines are becoming computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we developed bronko, an ultrafast alignment-free framework for detecting viral variation directly from sequencing data. The novel computational approach implemented in bronko allows scaling to massive viral sequencing datasets and has three key components: i) a locality-sensitive bucketing function to rapidly identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to reference(s), ii) a direct k-mer count psuedo-mapping approach that approximates a pileup without alignment, and iii) a streaming-based sliding window outlier test to estimate baseline noise across the genome and precisely differentiate real minor variants from noise. Together, these components yield near-linear computational complexity with respect to sequencing depth, enabling bronko to process thousands of viral samples rapidly on modest hardware. Our results are threefold: 1) On simulated amplicon sequencing, bronko recovers variants with higher precision and comparable recall to existing tools while running up to one to three orders of magnitude faster; 2) bronko generates sequence alignments directly from sequencing data, with SNP content similar to that of whole-genome alignment while also running in a fraction of the time, and 3) applying bronko to longitudinal sequencing data from chronically infected SARS-CoV-2 patients revealed consistent patterns of intrahost diversification and adaptive mutations over time. Altogether, these results demonstrate bronko's potential as a scalable tool for large-scale viral genomic analyses, overcoming longstanding computational barriers for intrahost and interhost characterization of viral variation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">StructGuy: Data leakage free prediction of functional effects of genetic variants.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gress, A., Benasolo, C. A., +4 authors, Kalinina, O. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The extent to which variations in protein-coding genes affect protein function has drawn the biological machine learning community's attention to computationally model variant effect prediction tools. Multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVE) experiments serve as a rich data source, but cannot deliver enough data for training truly large neural-net models. Therefore, zero-shot methods, for example protein language models, have increasingly gained popularity. For these methods, MAVE results serve primarily for evaluation purposes, as exemplified by the ProteinGym benchmark. In this study, we argue that the rapidly increasing amounts of MAVE data can be used to train efficient supervised methods, presenting our new tool StructGuy, based on gradient boosting trees methodology. In contrast to other supervised methods in the field, StructGuy, thanks to its dedicated training dataset and data leakage-free training process, can predict variant effects for proteins not seen during training. To evaluate this generalization ability, we constructed a dedicated benchmark and compared StructGuy with zero-shot methods from the ProteinGym leaderboard achieving a competitive performance. Further, we demonstrate that thanks to its architecture and careful feature engineering, we are able to provide fully interpretable predictions and direct explanations of the influence of mutations on protein three-dimensional structure, which favourably differs StructGuy from zero-shot tools.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhancing Generative Decoders with Stochastic Training on Biomedical Data with Missingness</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shen, X., Bjerregaard, A., +1 author, Krogh, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical datasets are often heterogeneous and affected by noise or missing values. Deep Generative Decoders (DGD) provide a promising framework for latent representation learning, but their standard training procedure relies on sample-level stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which performs poorly with incomplete data. To address this, we introduce two stochastic training strategies --- Nested SGD and Feature Dropout --- that incorporate feature-level randomness into optimization. Evaluations on biomedical tabular datasets demonstrate that Nested SGD improves robustness under missingness the best, while Feature Dropout not only improves but also accelerates convergence with lower computational cost. These results suggest that feature-level stochasticity is a practical way to strengthen biomedical AI pipelines.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Islands of Signal and Transcriptomic Sequencing: A Foundation Model for Mutation and Lineage Prediction based on DNAMethylation and RNA-seq</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Alexakos, A., Tsirigos, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA methylation and RNA-seq provide complementary views of oncogenic state, but their high dimensionality complicates robust modeling. We develop a pan-cancer, multi-omic foundation model that jointly encodes CpG-island DNA methylation and gene expression from TCGA, TARGET, CPTAC-3, and HCMI. Probe-level methylation is aggregated into CpG-island features, and RNA-seq is reduced to high-variance genes, yielding compact inputs for modality-specific MLP encoders. A BERT-like transformer with masked reconstruction and cross-modal prediction objectives learns a shared embedding space that supports missing-modality inputs. We evaluate the learned representations in two zero-shot settings: (i) cancer-type classification using a linear probe on frozen embeddings, and (ii) mutation prediction for 214 genes using a shallow MLP. The model achieves high performance for many tumor types and gene-cancer pairs without encoder fine-tuning. Pathway-level analyses show that hallmark oncogenic and immune programs appear as smooth gradients in the embedding space, indicating that the model captures biologically meaningful structure. These results demonstrate that combining CpG-island grouping with multi-omic foundation pre-training yields compact, informative embeddings for mutation and lineage inference across cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pseudodynamics+: Reconstructing Population Dynamics from Time-Resolved Single Cell Landscapes with Physics Informed Neural Networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zheng, W., Barile, M., +3 authors, Gottgens, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell profiling provides snapshots of the heterogeneous states that characterise developmental processes, organ regeneration and progression towards disease in a complex landscape. The underlying trajectories are of pivotal interest, but existing methods for reconstructing cell state trajectories commonly neglect population sizes. However, snapshot experiments make it difficult to interpret cell flux because the observed trajectories are confounded by changes in overall population size. This ambiguity can lead to misinterpreting changes in proliferation or death rates as changes in cellular migration. We introduce pseudodynamics+, a physics-informed neural network framework that solves high-dimensional flow equations on complex, branching landscapes. By integrating single-cell genomics with population dynamics, pseudodynamics+ estimates state- and time-dependent parameters of growth, differentiation, and diffusion. The model recapitulates proliferation bursts during T-cell maturation and, when applied to LARRY-barcoded data, predicts differentiation rates consistent with clonal behaviour. When applied to time-resolved persistent-labelling datasets of in vivo mouse bone marrow haematopoiesis, pseudodynamics+ reconstructs continuous tissue flows with dynamic parameters aligned with known molecular signatures. Notably, simulations revealed a previously unrecognised shift from megakaryocyte-biased to balanced progenitor output, explained by evolving fate preferences of progenitor states, as revealed by simulations leveraging our estimated dynamic parameters. Pseudodynamics+ therefore establishes a population-aware framework for reconstructing single-cell population dynamics and is available at https://github.com/Gottgens-lab/pseudodynamics_plus.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GraTools, an user-friendly tool for exploring and manipulating pangenome variation graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ravel, S., Marthe, N., +3 authors, Tranchant-Dubreuil, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pangenome variation graphs (PVG), which represent genomic diversity through multiple genomes alignment, are powerful tools for studying genomic variations in populations. However, current tools often lack integration, efficiency, or require format conversions, to use them, hindering their usability. Here, we introduce GraTools, a fast and user-friendly command-line tool for manipulating PVG in their native GFA format. GraTools indexes PVG once, enabling rapid subgraph extraction, fasta sequence recovery, and comprehensive analyses - including core/dispensable genome ratios or group-specific segment identification. Its modular architecture relies on optimized data structures (BAM/BED files), parallel processing, and asynchronous I/O for scalability. GraTools supports also non-reference coordinates and integrates with visualization tools like Bandage. Using an Asian rice pangenome graph (13 accessions), we demonstrate its ability to extract subgraphs, compute depth statistics, and identify subspecies-specific segments. The tool intuitive interface, its real-time feedback and its detailed logging allows its usability for diverse applications, from population genetics to breeding and genomic medicine, from biologists to bioinformaticians. Through a unified graph manipulation interface, GraTools overcomes the limitations of fragmented workflows for PVG use. It is available as an open-source tools (GNU GPLv3), with its documentation available at https://gratools.readthedocs.io.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Role of Myc family proteins in transcriptional regulation of growth and oncogenic transformation in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chatterjee, B., RAUT, P. K., +6 authors, Barr, F. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) is driven by a PAX3::FOXO1 (P3F) or PAX7::FOXO1 (P7F) fusion gene. After finding that MYCN is required for P3F-induced oncogenic transformation in a human myoblast model of FP-RMS, we further investigated the role of Myc family proteins in FP-RMS. Expression studies revealed that myoblast models and a subset of FP-RMS lines have predominant MYCN or MYC expression whereas other FP-RMS lines have both high MYCN and MYC expression. In myoblast models, MYCN was required for optimal P3F binding to and high-level activation of FGF8, a P3F target that is necessary and sufficient for oncogenic transformation. MYCN or MYC knockdown suppressed transformation in myoblast and FP-RMS lines with dominant MYCN or MYC expression, respectively. In FP-RMS lines with high MYCN and MYC expression, there was partial loss of transformation when one gene was targeted and complete loss when both genes were targeted. Despite the loss of oncogenic activity in lines with knockdown of a dominant Myc family member, FGF8 expression was not decreased. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that P3F target genes were not affected by MYCN or MYC knockdown, and instead a group of Myc-specific targets was down-regulated. Collectively, these results indicate that MYCN or MYC is functionally dominant in myoblast models and FP-RMS lines with dominant expression of one Myc family protein whereas MYCN and MYC are functionally redundant in FP-RMS cell lines with high expression of both. These Myc family proteins contribute to oncogenic properties by facilitating P3F activation of FGF8 and increasing expression of Myc-specific targets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genetic barcoding of individual cells links cancer evolutionary trajectories and prognostic outcomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Merle, C., Di Terlizzi, I., +6 authors, Fre, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intratumoural heterogeneity (ITH) reflects cancer progression, by integrating clonal dynamics, cell plasticity, and metastatic potential of malignant cells. Defining the origins and evolutionary trajectories of tumour cells is central to preventing tumour growth and dissemination, yet significant gaps in knowledge persist. Here, we used an original single cell resolution lineage tracing system to investigate how ITH underlies changes in tumour cell states, such as the acquisition of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and invasive capacity. By combining in vivo genetic barcoding with single-cell transcriptomics, we uncover two parallel evolutionary trajectories toward EMT: one associated with alveolar differentiation, and another characterized by gene regulatory programs activated during stress and tissue regeneration. Of interest, only the gene modules defining the regenerative trajectory were found to correlate with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Our results also provide a quantitative framework 25 tomeasure cellular plasticity that enables the identification of highly plastic cells and their gene signatures, correlating with rapid changes in transcriptional state, EMT features and aggressive cancer. These findings deliver a comprehensive view of in vivo clonal evolution in breast cancer, uncovering the interplay between lineage plasticity and tumour progression with quantitative and robust statistical approaches.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">High-confidence structural predictions of extrachromosomal DNA with ecDNAInspector</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pribus, S. J., Zhao, Y., +4 authors, Curtis, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) are circularized genomic elements that reside outside canonical chromosomes. ecDNA amplify oncogene copy number, enhance chromatin accessibility, and act as mobile enhancers through cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, collectively boosting oncogene expression. ecDNA has been implicated in tumor progression, intratumoral heterogeneity, and poor patient prognosis. Despite various lines of evidence that ecDNA promotes aggressive disease, the mechanisms and selective pressures leading to ecDNA formation and propagation remain poorly understood as are their structures. While several computational tools have been developed to infer ecDNA presence or absence from short read sequencing data, accurate identification of large or complex ecDNA structures remains challenging. Here we introduce ecDNAInspector, a novel computational framework to systematically assess the confidence of ecDNA predictions from existing inference tools. Leveraging abundant short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from population-scale cohorts, we demonstrate that ecDNAInspector accurately identifies high-confidence ecDNA calls, improving interpretability and facilitating the association with clinical features. As an illustrative example, applied to a cohort of 250 breast cancers, ecDNAInspector identifies associations between ecDNA structure and molecular subgroups of disease. These findings are supported by orthogonal omic data and experimental characterization of ecDNA captured in representative cell lines. ecDNAInspector provides a scalable, data-driven approach to characterize ecDNA structure, enabling integrative studies of the clinical and biological impact of this non-mendelian mode of oncogene amplification and inheritance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning-based integration of dosiomics and pre-radiotherapy multimodal MRI radiomics for survival stratification in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Atefeh Mahmoudi, Arash Zare Sadeghi, +4 authors, Seied Rabi Mahdavi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumor heterogeneity is a significant factor contributing to the marked differences in survival rates among glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, who face a poor prognosis. To improve personalized treatment, it is essential to identify specific tumor characteristics that capture this variability and aid in predicting survival. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of dosiomics and radiomics in predicting overall survival (OS). The central hypothesis was that integrating dosiomics and radiomics could improve survival outcome predictions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Non-invasive assessment of PD-L1 status and histology in non-small cell lung cancer using 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tomasik B, Jakalski M, +7 authors, Mieczkowski J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract Purpose Radiomics analysis of 18 F-FDG PET/CT enables extraction of high-dimensional quantitative features that may serve as imaging biomarkers for tumor biology. In particular, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such features could potentially predict immune checkpoint biomarker status, such as PD-L1 expression, and histological subtype without the need for invasive tissue sampling. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed pre-treatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans of 115 patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) and known PD-L1 status. Radiomic features were extracted from primary tumors and combined with basic clinical variables (“ naïve features ”). Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were performed to assess separability between the selected classes representing either PD-L1 subtype or histology. Multiple machine learning classifiers, including random forest (RF), were trained using radiomic-only, naïve-only, and combined feature sets. Model performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Results For PD-L1 prediction, the RF model trained on radiomic features achieved the highest accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.83, 95% CI = [0.75–0.91]), outperforming the combined feature model (AUC-ROC = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.73–0.89]) and naïve-only generalized linear and RF models (AUC-ROC ~ 0.5). Heatmap analysis of selected radiomic features showed significant clustering of PD-L1-positive and -negative tumors (Fisher’s exact p = 7×10⁻⁴). For histological subtype classification, the best-performing RF model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.76 using radiomic features. Although PCA demonstrated partial separation between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (PC1 = 38%, PC2 = 21%), the hierarchical clustering led to the significant class separation (p = 0.0234). Conclusions Our pilot project indicated that 18 F-FDG PET/CT radiomics enables accurate non-invasive prediction of PD-L1 expression and provides moderate discrimination between major NSCLC histological subtypes. Clinical variables alone have negligible predictive value for PD-L1 status. Radiomic models may complement histopathology, particularly when tissue sampling is limited or repeated biomarker assessment is required. Prospective, multi-center validation is needed to confirm generalizability and facilitate clinical translation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in sorafenib-resistant HCC via machine learning and experimental validation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jinrui Zhang, Wenhan Geng, +3 authors, Ke Tan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains a significant health burden with poor survival rates due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the standard first-line therapy for advanced HCC, but long-term use often leads to drug resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has emerged as a crucial target in cancer therapy, showing potential to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis in HCC cells and that ferroptosis plays a significant role in the development of sorafenib resistance. However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance remains poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Our study focuses on the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Using the GSE109211 dataset, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with sorafenib resistance. Notably, these genes stratified sorafenib-resistant HCC patients into distinct subgroups with different drug sensitivities, immune cell infiltrations, and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Through machine learning algorithms, three hub genes (ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1) were identified to be closely associated with sorafenib resistance. A novel ferroptosis-related signature comprising these genes emerged as a robust diagnostic model, validated by ROC curve analysis, for predicting sorafenib resistance in HCC patients. Furthermore, experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1 expressions in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, with sorafenib treatment altering their expression profiles. Knockdown of ULK1 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells potently enhanced sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating sorafenib resistance. Our findings not only identify pivotal ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers for sorafenib resistance but also provide insights into the role of ferroptosis in modulating sorafenib responsiveness. This study offers a promising strategy to overcome sorafenib resistance and improve patient outcomes in HCC treatment, highlighting the potential of ferroptosis-targeted therapies in cancer management.</p>
