<h2 class="paper-title">Integration of Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, and Experimental Validation to Identify Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers Associated With Succinylation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wu S, Pan J, +2 authors, Tan Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent and lethal subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with its progression closely associated with aberrant succinylation modifications. This study aimed to systematically identify succinylation-related genes in LUAD and evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic significance. By integrating four Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, 45 differentially expressed succinylation-related candidate genes were identified. Feature selection using three machine learning methods-Lasso regression, support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and Random Forest-yielded seven core genes: TIMP1, SLC2A1, JUP, F12, B3GALNT1, DSP, and MMP1. ROC analysis showed that all core genes achieved AUC values greater than 0.7, indicating strong diagnostic potential. A diagnostic model constructed from these seven genes achieved an AUC of 0.912 in the training cohort, significantly outperforming single-gene models, and was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (AUC = 0.893). Prognostic analysis revealed that Kaplan-Meier curves for all seven core genes demonstrated p 1, indicating that high expression was associated with poor outcomes. A risk prediction nomogram was also developed based on these genes. SHAP analysis clarified each gene's contribution to the model, while drug enrichment and transcriptional regulatory network analyses provided further insights into potential therapeutic targets. Notably, JUP exhibited the highest diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.921) and was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment regulation. Molecular docking suggested stable binding between JUP and potential therapeutic compounds, single-cell analysis confirmed its marked overexpression in tumor and epithelial cells, and experimental validation further established its oncogenic role. In conclusion, this study systematically defines the diagnostic and prognostic value of seven succinylation-related core genes in LUAD, with JUP playing a particularly pivotal role. These findings provide robust evidence supporting its potential as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The diagnostic landscape of bone and soft tissue sarcoma: the pan-sarcoma era and AI-driven classification.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cross WC.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are a diagnostic challenge due to their histological complexity, variety, and mutational heterogeneity. This has led to continued refinements in classification and diagnostic criteria, presented and soon to be updated by the WHO. This commentary features articles published in this journal and elsewhere that have ultilised pan-sarcoma datasets and artificial intelligence-based classifiers. A notable entry is the DKFZ Sarcoma Classifier, which is based on methylation profiles and available for use via a commercial platform. This work has created hope that one day a comprehensive sarcoma classifier will be available, though it is also a reminder of the many challenges apparent in studying rare cancer types.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Decoding Dendritic Cell Subtypes via Integrated Radiogenomics: A Stacked Ensemble Model for Predicting Immunotherapy Response in NSCLC.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang Q, Deng L, +7 authors, Chen F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We pioneer a multimodal framework integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), radiomics, and deep learning to decipher dendritic cell (DC)-mediated mechanisms underlying anti-PD-1 response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor samples from responders and non-responders identified nine immune cell types, among which DCs displayed significant differences between groups. Cell-cell communication and pseudotime analyses highlighted conventional DC2 (cDC2) and tolerogenic DC (tDC) as key subsets linked to therapeutic outcomes. Four cDC2 marker genes (FAM3B, TFAP2A, RTKN2, and XCL2) and two tDC marker genes (KRT6A and RAB27B) showed predictive value, and experimental validation confirmed reduced cDC2 and tDC abundance in responders, with upregulation of FAM3B, RTKN2, and XCL2, and downregulation of TFAP2A, KRT6A, and RAB27B. DCs also modulated CD8+ T cell activity via OSM-IL6ST and IL15-IL15RA signaling. These six genes were incorporated into machine learning models combining transcriptomic (LSTM), clinical (EnhancedClinicalRNA), and radiomic (ResNet50) data. A stacked ensemble learning approach integrating all three modalities achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 0.97 and an AUC of 0.99. In summary, our results demonstrate that combining single-cell transcriptomics and radiomics through ensemble deep learning enables accurate prediction of immunotherapy response in NSCLC, and identifies six DC-associated marker genes with potential as prognostic biomarkers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CAPIM: Catalytic activity and site prediction and analysis tool in multimer proteins.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Özsari G, García-Soriano DA, +2 authors, Wittung-Stafshede P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enzymes play a fundamental role in living organisms by catalyzing vital chemical reactions. While much is known about enzyme function, a substantial portion of the proteome remains uncharacterized. Computational tools have become indispensable in this field, yet most focus exclusively on either enzymatic activity prediction or active site detection, creating a gap between residue-level annotation and functional characterization. To bridge this gap, we present Catalytic Activity and Site Prediction and Analysis Tool In Multimer Proteins (CAPIM) -an integrative computational pipeline that combines binding pocket identification and catalytic site annotation with enzymatic activities, along with functional validation via enzyme-substrate docking. CAPIM unifies the capabilities of three established tools: P2Rank, GASS, and AutoDock Vina. P2Rank uses a machine learning-based approach to predict binding pockets, while genetic active site search (GASS) identifies catalytically active residues and annotates them with Enzyme Commission numbers. These outputs are merged to generate residue-level activity profiles within predicted pockets. Functional validation is then performed using AutoDock Vina, enabling substrate docking simulations for user-defined ligands. CAPIM supports any number of peptide chains in the protein complex-which may be crucial for enzymatic functions dependent on quaternary and/or polymeric (e.g., amyloid) structures. The utility of CAPIM is demonstrated through case studies involving both well-characterized enzymes and unannotated multi-chain targets. By delivering residue-level predictions and docking analyses in a unified framework, CAPIM offers a powerful resource with broad applications in drug discovery and protein engineering. CAPIM is available both as a standalone application at https://git.chalmers.se/ozsari/capim-app and as a hosted web service at https://capim-app.serve.scilifelab.se.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AAPM MEDICAL PHYSICS PRACTICE GUIDELINE 10.b: Scope of practice for clinical medical physics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lim SB, Busse N, +6 authors, Tarver RB.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is a nonprofit professional society whose mission is "Advancing medicine through excellence in the science, education and professional practice of medical physics." The AAPM has roughly 10,000 members and is the principal organization of medical physicists in the United States. The AAPM will periodically define new practice guidelines for medical physics practice to help advance the science of medical physics and to improve the quality of service to patients throughout the United States. Existing medical physics practice guidelines will be reviewed for the purpose of revision or renewal, as appropriate, on their fifth anniversary or sooner. Each medical physics practice guideline (MPPG) represents a policy statement by the AAPM, has undergone a thorough consensus process in which it has been subjected to extensive review, and requires the approval of the Professional Council. The medical physics practice guidelines recognize that the safe and effective use of diagnostic and therapeutic radiology requires specific training, skills, and techniques, as described in each document. Reproduction or modification of the published practice guidelines and technical standards by those entities not providing these services is not authorized. This report is an update of MPPG10.a, published in 2018, and provides the current minimum guidelines for the scope of practice for clinical medical physics as it has evolved to meet emerging needs and changes in practice. The following terms are used in the AAPM practice guidelines: Must and Must Not: Used to indicate that adherence to the recommendation is considered necessary to conform to this practice guideline. While must is the term to be used in the guidelines, if an entity that adopts the guideline has shall as the preferred term, the AAPM considers that must and shall have the same meaning. Should and Should Not: Used to indicate a prudent practice to which exceptions may occasionally be made in appropriate circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Accurate affinity models for SH2 domains from peptide binding assays and free-energy regression.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gagoski D, Rube HT, +5 authors, Bussemaker HJ.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Short linear peptide motifs play important roles in phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling networks. They can act both as substrates of kinases and phosphatases and as ligands of peptide binding domains. SH2 domains bind specifically to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, with the affinity of the interaction depending strongly on the flanking sequence. In recent years, protein display technologies and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed researchers to profile SH2 domain binding across large libraries of candidate ligands. Here, we present a concerted experimental and computational strategy that updates such specificity profiling from classification to quantification. Multi-round affinity selection on random phosphopeptide libraries yields NGS data suitable for training an additive model that accurately predicts binding free energy across the full theoretical ligand sequence space. For SH2 domains that have been profiled in this manner, the sequence-to-affinity model can be used to predict novel phosphosite targets or the impact of phosphosite variants on binding.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Training bias and sequence alignments shape protein-peptide docking by AlphaFold and related methods.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guan L, Keating AE.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-peptide interactions mediate many biological processes. Accurate structural models of protein-peptide complexes, determined by experiment or computational prediction, are essential for understanding function and designing interaction inhibitors. AlphaFold2-Multimer (AF2-Multimer), AlphaFold3 (AF3), and related models such as Boltz-1 and Chai-1 can predict protein-peptide binding geometry, often with high accuracy. Using a dataset of experimentally resolved structures, we analyzed the performance of these four structure prediction models to understand how they work. We found evidence of bias for previously seen structures, indicating that models struggle to generalize to novel proteins or binding sites. We tested how models use the protein and peptide multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which are often shallow or of poor quality for peptide sequences. We found weak evidence that models use coevolutionary information from paired MSAs, but both the protein and peptide unpaired MSAs contribute to prediction accuracy. Our work highlights the promise of deep learning for peptide docking and the importance of diverse representation of interface geometries in the training data for optimal prediction performance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CDR-aware masked language models for pairedantibodies enable state-of-the-art bindingprediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Talaei, M., Walker, K. C., +7 authors, Joseph-McCarthy, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibodies are a leading class of biologics, yet their architecture with conserved framework regions and hypervariable complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) poses unique challenges for computational modeling. We present a region-aware pretraining strategy for paired heavy (VH) and light (VL) sequences in variable domains using ESM2-3B and ESM C (600M) protein language models. We compare three masking strategies: whole-chain, CDR-focused, and a hybrid approach. Through evaluation on binding affinity datasets spanning single-mutant panels and combinatorial mutants, we demonstrate that CDR-focused training produces superior embed-dings for functional prediction. Notably, training only on VH-VL pairs proves sufficient, eliminating the need for massive unpaired pretraining that provides no measurable downstream benefit. Our compact 600M ESM-C model achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or exceeding larger antibody-specific baselines. These findings establish a principled framework for antibody language models: prioritize paired sequences with CDR-aware supervision over scale and complex training curricula to achieve both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Foster, Z. S. L., Sudermann, M. A., +7 authors, Grunwald, N. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers a comprehensive, organism-agnostic method that effectively meets the need for efficient, reliable, and standardized responses to emerging threats from pathogens and pests. Here, we present PathogenSurveillance, an open-source and automated Nextflow pipeline for population genomic analyses of WGS data. It is designed with features tailored for biosurveillance and is suitable for in-field or point-of-care diagnostics. PathogenSurveillance is flexible, accommodating short- and long-read datasets and mixed samples of prokaryotes and/or eukaryotes. It automates all steps, including reference identification and retrieval from the NCBI Assembly database, and produces customizable interactive reports with summaries, phylogenetic trees, and minimum spanning networks that enable species and subspecies level identification. It also outputs quality control metrics and organizes genomic data hierarchically to facilitate downstream analyses. The pipeline runs on any Linux-based system and minimizes the need for advanced computational expertise. Source code is available on GitHub under the open-source MIT license. The pipeline expands the toolkit for real-time biosurveillance, enabling rapid detection and monitoring of pathogens and pests for rapid response to novel variants.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Stuckless, E. E., Gai, L. S., +4 authors, Edgell, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Diatoms are globally significant microalgae that contribute ~20% of oxygen production and exhibit remarkable metabolic diversity. The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has emerged as a promising synthetic biology platform for bioproduction of recombinant proteins, supported by a human-like N-linked glycosylation pathway. However, its (1,3)-linked core fucose is immunogenic in humans and thus limits biopharmaceutical applications. One hurdle to efficient genome engineering in P. tricornutum is the lack of a robust system for simultaneous CRISPR/Cas9 editing at multiple sites. To overcome this limitation, we develop PHYCUT (Phaeodactylum tricornutum Csy4-Cas9 multiplex tool), a versatile plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas9 system that uses the Csy4 endoribonuclease to process multi-guide RNA arrays. To highlight PHYCUT applications, we demonstrate multiplex editing of all three FucT genes responsible for (1,3) fucosylation in P. tricornutum, yielding strains with markedly reduced fucosylation of secreted proteins. PHYCUT enables facile, multiplexed genome engineering in diatoms and provides a foundation for humanizing the P. tricornutum glycosylation pathway to support next-generation algal biotechnology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">STARCall integrates image stitching, alignment, and read calling to enable scalable analysis of in situ sequencing data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bradley, N. J., Pendyala, S., +1 author, Fowler, D. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fluorescent in situ sequencing involves imaging-based sequencing by synthesis in intact cells or tissues to reveal target nucleotide sequences inside each cell. Often, the target sequences are barcodes that indicate a perturbation (e.g. CRISPR guide or genetic variant) delivered to the cell. However, processing in situ sequencing data presents a considerable challenge, requiring stitching and aligning tens of thousands of images with millions of cells, detecting small amplicon colonies across sequencing cycles, and calling reads. To address these challenges, we introduce STARCall: STitching, Alignment and Read Calling for in situ sequencing, a software package that analyzes raw in situ sequencing images to produce a genotype-to-phenotype mapping for each cell. STARCall improves upon previous solutions by combining stitching and alignment of images into a single step that minimizes both inter-cycle and intra-cycle alignment error. STARCall also improves detection and extraction of sequencing reads, incorporating filters and normalization to combat background fluorophore signal. We compare STARCall to other methods using a diverse set of images that include commonly encountered imaging problems such as variable intensity across channels and cycles and high levels of background. Specifically, this comprises ~250,000 images from a pooled screen of ~3,500 barcoded LMNA variants expressed in U2OS cells and ~1,200 barcoded PTEN variants in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and iPSC-derived neurons. Overall, STARCall aligned more than 50% of tiles with &lt;1 pixel error on all nine image sets while alternative packages had higher error on four. STARCall also yielded an 8-40% increase in genotyped cells due to improved filtering and normalization methods that address background fluorescence. STARCall can call tools like CellPose to segment cells and CellProfiler to compute cell features from the phenotyping images. STARcall is open-source and freely available, providing a robust solution for the analysis of in situ sequencing data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">COTree: A Statistical Framework for Deciphering Cell-Resolved Multi-Omics Trajectories</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yuan, B., Wei, R., +4 authors, Wang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in whole-cell modeling enable the computational tracking of the temporal evolution of thousands of molecular species across genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic layers. These models provide a complementary perspective for studying cellular dynamics, offering continuous, system-wide observations that are difficult to obtain from experimental technologies, which are often destructive and yield only static measurements from limited modalities. While whole-cell models generate multi-omic simulation trajectories with high temporal resolution, analyzing and interpreting such complex data remains a major challenge that limits their potential to elucidate cellular dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose COTree, a statistical framework that learns integrated multi-omic representations and constructs a trajectory principal tree to summarize cellular progression patterns. COTree enables a broad range of downstream analyses, including cell classification, fate prediction, developmental time detection, and driver species identification, that provide new insights into how cells develop and differentiate. To demonstrate its practical utility, we apply COTree to a multi-omic trajectory dataset generated from the whole-cell model of JCVI-Syn3A, revealing cell types, characterizing long-term cellular dynamics, and identifying key driver species associated with cell death and replication.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Surkov, M. M., Litovets, A. Y., Yaroshevich, I. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Carotenoproteins play essential roles across all domains of life, yet identifying them from sequence or structure remains a significant challenge due to the lack of conserved motifs. To address this gap, we present ProteinSight, a deep learning pipeline that identifies potential binding sites for carotenoids and related isoprenoids. Our approach, which utilizes a 3D U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of physicochemical property maps, serves as a proof-of-concept for a new generation of structure-based protein function predictors. On a rigorously curated test set, ProteinSight functions as a highly sensitive and specific detector, reliably distinguishing positive from negative control proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility for hypothesis generation by predicting previously uncharacterized, plausible interaction sites on Human Serum Albumin. ProteinSight presents a scalable framework with the potential to aid in accelerating the discovery of novel carotenoproteins from large-scale structural data, potentially opening new avenues for functional annotation and bioengineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fine-tuned Protein Language Model Identifies Antigen-specific B Cell Receptors from Immune Repertoires</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Paco, K., Mendivil, M. P., +20 authors, Ray, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scalable identification of antigen-specific antibodies from whole immune repertoire V(D)J sequences is a central challenge in biomedical engineering. We show that protein language models (PLMs) fine-tuned on antibody heavy-chain sequences can directly predict antigen specificity from unselected immune repertoires. We assessed our model, Antigen Specificity Predictor (ASPred), against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and HIV-AIDS antigens, observing comparable predictive performance. In the whole immune repertoire V(D)J sequences of mice immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), ASPred identified antibody sequences specific to RBD. Several candidate sequences were validated, including one as a heavy chain-only nanobody with 20.7 nM dissociation constant. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the predicted interactions at coarse-grained and atomic levels. Benchmarking against Barcode-Enabled Antigen Mapping (BEAM) of B cell receptor sequence data had highly significant overlaps with ASPred predictions, suggesting scalability. The predicted SARS-CoV-2 binders differed substantially from training sequences, demonstrating generalization beyond sequence memorization. Together, we establish that heavy chain antibody sequences encode sufficient information for PLMs to infer specificity, offering a scalable framework for antibody discovery with broad applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Which pLM to choose?</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Senoner, T., Koludarov, I., +3 authors, Bromberg, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-language models (pLMs) provide a novel means for mapping the protein space. Which of these new maps best advances specific biological analyses, however, is not obvious. To elucidate the principles of model selection, we benchmarked fourteen pLMs, spanning several orders of magnitude in parameter count, across a hundred million protein pairs, to assess how well they capture sequence, structure, and function similarity. For each model, we distinguish inherent information, i.e. signal recoverable from raw-embedding distances, and extractable information, i.e. signal revealed through additional supervised training. Three key results emerge. First, pLM protein representation space is inherently different from the space of biological protein representations, i.e. sequences or structures. Here, a size-performance paradox is salient - mid-scale foundation models are as good as much larger ones in reflecting all tested biological properties. Second, pLM representations compress and store biological information in proportion to model size. That is, a lightweight feed-forward network can be trained on embedding pairs to predict said biological properties well - a capacity dividend. Finally, we observe that a task-specific learning radically reshapes the embedding space, gaining inherent understanding of the task, but garbling any further extractions. In other words, smaller pLMs can provide efficient and compute-light general insight. Larger models are advantageous only when fine-tuning is planned to accomplish a specific task. Furthermore, representations generated by "specialist" models are not immediately generalizable throughout protein biology. Thus, for pLMs, bigger isn't always better.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TSProm: Deciphering the Genomic Context of Tissue Specificity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Surana, P., Dutta, P., +4 authors, Davuluri, R. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Characterizing tissue-specific (TSp) gene expression is crucial for understanding development and disease; however, traditional expression-based methods often overlook the latent regulatory grammar embedded in the non-coding DNA, particularly in distal promoter regions. Here, we introduce TSProm, a framework that specializes a DNA foundation model (DNABERT2) to decipher the long-range regulatory logic of TSp promoters at the gene isoform level. The contributions of our work are two-fold. First, we propose a novel comparative design that trains two distinct models, A: for general promoter biology and B: for TSp regulation. These models enable the precise isolation of sequence motifs around the transcription start site that uniquely define tissue identity. Second, we introduce a comprehensive explainable AI (xAI) module that integrates attention-based discovery with model-agnostic SHAP analysis for a robust, cross-validated interpretation of learned features. Applying this framework to human brain, liver, and testis promoters, we identified and validated clinically relevant transcription factors (TFs) in brain, such as SP1, MYC, and HES6, and confirmed their known roles in diseases such as gliomas and neuroblastomas. Our analysis further revealed that C2H2 zinc finger proteins are a dominant feature of the global landscape of TSp gene regulation. TSProm provides a novel and interpretable framework for identifying TSp gene regulatory elements, offering powerful computational tools for the study of tissue-specific gene regulation in normal and disease conditions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">LncRNA YIYA enhances pancreatic cancer proliferation under high-glucose conditions through RAS and PKM2 mediated metabolic reprogramming that reinforces the Warburg phenotype</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Garge, N. D., Sharma, A., +1 author, Chowdhury, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Diabetes and the resulting hyperglycemia are metabolic complications frequently linked to pancreatic cancer (PC). In this study, we observe that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)- YIYA, which resides in a genomic region (1q32), frequently altered in various cancers, is overexpressed under conditions of chronic or intermittent high glucose (HG; 25 mM) compared to normal glucose (NG; 5.5 mM) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. It plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular metabolism-linked proliferation of PDAC cells, both under 2D and 3D conditions. Analysis of clinical datasets suggested that patients with elevated YIYA expression generally experience reduced survival in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, YIYA was found to regulate cellular energy metabolism and promote a Warburg phenotype, thereby facilitating the rapid proliferative status of PDAC cells. YIYA-mediated effects were found to be dependent on KRAS. Interestingly, the RIP assay revealed that YIYA interacts not only with KRAS but also with an important enzyme catalyzing the final step of the biochemical process, glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). YIYA was found to be predominantly localised in the cytoplasm, protecting the stability of the KRAS protein under a hyperglycaemic state. Importantly, YIYA knockdown enhanced autophagy-mediated degradation of KRAS. Our study is the first to identify YIYA as a glucose-responsive lncRNA in PDAC cells, and to reveal a novel YIYA-mediated connection between oncogenic KRAS signalling and metabolic reprogramming. Targeting YIYA represents a promising therapeutic strategy by disrupting the KRASand PKM2 Warburg axis, thereby sensitizing PDAC cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transcriptional Profiling of Commonly Used Liver Cancer Cell Lines Reveals Disease-Specific Modeling Potential and Authentication Concerns</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sarfaraz, N., Rosen, G., +3 authors, Bouchard, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell lines are essential tools for liver cancer research, yet their molecular fidelity to primary tumors remains incompletely characterized. Here we comprehensively evaluated transcriptomic similarities between commonly used liver cancer cell lines and primary tumor subtypes to guide optimal model selection. We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 541 samples spanning primary HCC, HPBL, CHOL, and FLC tumors, alongside 21 liver cancer cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Through systematic variance analysis, we identified 2,523 highly variable genes distinguishing cancer subtypes and cell lines, then performed correlation analyses, unsupervised clustering, and pathway enrichment to assess molecular similarities. Molecular subtypes within each cancer type were identified through hierarchical clustering and characterized using pathway analysis. HepG2 cells showed strongest correlation with HPBL (r=0.62), confirming their hepatoblastoma origin despite frequent HCC misclassification. This correlation was driven by shared Wnt pathway dysregulation signatures. Huh7 cells best represented HCC, particularly the immune-modulatory, MYC-activated subtype with the highest median correlation. RBE cells optimally modeled CHOL, specifically the dedifferentiated, immune-evasive subtype. Several commonly used cell lines (LO2, SMMC-7721, MHCC97L) and specific publicly available samples demonstrated likely HeLa contamination. Primary human hepatocytes cultured under physioxic conditions better preserved liver-specific transcriptional programs compared to standard culture. No established cell line analyzed represented FLC strongly, identifying the need for a standard, available model. This transcriptomic framework provides evidence-based guidance for selecting appropriate liver cancer cell line models and highlights the critical need for rigorous cell line validation to improve experimental design and translational relevance of liver cancer research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A novel Fc-optimized antibody drug conjugate targeting CD7 for the therapy of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gehlert, C. L., Schewe, D. M., +22 authors, Peipp, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While treatment for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has improved in the last decades, therapeutic options for patients refractory to standard therapy or with relapsing disease are limited. In particular, no immunotherapy option has been approved in T-ALL yet. Here, a novel dual antibody engineering approach for targeting CD7 was evaluated. The chimeric CD7 antibody chimTH69 was modified by Fc engineering to improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In addition, it was conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent. The resulting Fc-optimized antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), designated chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE, showed a unique set of effector functions in vitro. It triggered ADCC by mononuclear cells at picomolar concentrations, mediated ADCP by macrophages and directly inhibited the growth of a panel of T-ALL cell lines by delivering the cytotoxic compound to induce G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, due to its specific linker design, chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE demonstrated bystander killing activity against CD7-negative leukemia cells. In mice, CD7-directed therapy with chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE inhibited the growth of subcutaneous CCRF-CEM T-ALL xenografts. Moreover, chimTH69-DE-vcMMAE exerted strong antileukemic effects in a phase II-like patient-derived xenograft preclinical trial in pediatric and adult patients when applied in an experimental overt leukemia setting. ChimTH69-DE-vcMMAE induced minimal residual disease-negativity in one PDX model. These findings indicate that targeting CD7 with the novel Fc-optimized ADC is a potent strategy to trigger anti-leukemia responses and may open a novel therapeutic avenue for T-ALL treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MicroRNA bioinformatics in precision oncology: an integrated pipeline from NGS to AI-based target discovery.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mritunjoy Dey, Piotr Remiszewski, +3 authors, Anna M Czarnecka</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the growing recognition of microRNAs (miRNAs) as critical biomarkers in cancer, current approaches to their analysis remain fragmented, disjointed, and poorly integrated with emerging computational advances. This lack of cohesion limits progress toward reproducible and clinically actionable biomarker discovery. To address this unmet need, we present a review that unifies the latest findings and tools in bioinformatics, machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) for miRNA analysis in oncology, thereby bridging a significant methodological gap in the field. We begin by critically synthesizing, benchmarking, and evaluating algorithms, including miRDeep2 and DIANA-miRPath, within a functional pipeline that spans next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing to multi-omics integration. Building on this foundation, we review ML-augmented layers incorporating supervised and deep learning (DL) algorithms, specifically support vector machines (SVMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to enable robust miRNA signature identification, classification, and target prediction. Furthermore, we explore the integration of generative models and LLMs to support hypothesis generation and enhance reproducibility in biomarker discovery workflows. This comprehensive framework enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) is contextualized through cancer-specific datasets, with particular emphasis on translational applications for early detection, prognosis, and therapy selection. By systematically organizing fragmented methodologies into a scalable and reproducible pipeline, our work provides a strategic roadmap to accelerate the development of miRNA-based precision cancer.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Chang Fan, Wenlong Zhu, +2 authors, Jin Ding</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal stromal components that shape the tumor microenvironment through their remarkable heterogeneity and dynamic functions. This review comprehensively examines the biology of CAFs, starting with their diverse cellular origins and induction mechanisms via key signaling pathways. We highlight the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of CAF subsets and propose an updated classification system that encompasses eight functionally distinct subtypes based on recent single-cell transcriptomic studies. The tumor-promoting roles of CAFs are explored in depth, including their contributions to tumor behavior through novel mechanisms such as neutrophil extracellular traps formation, and multidrug resistance via metabolic reprogramming. A major focus is placed on CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance through immune checkpoint regulation, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and metabolite secretion. This review also highlights key technologies that are advancing CAF research, including patient-derived 3D models, artificial intelligence-enhanced spatial multiomics, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-engineered mouse systems, and machine learning approaches for analyzing CAF heterogeneity and function. Finally, we evaluate therapeutic strategies targeting CAF activation, secreted factors, and immune crosstalk, while critically analyzing ongoing clinical trials. Overall, this review not only clarifies the biology of CAFs but also provides a translational framework for developing next-generation stromal-targeted therapies to overcome treatment resistance in cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Physical foundations for trustworthy medical imaging: A survey for artificial intelligence researchers.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Miriam Cobo, David Corral Fontecha, +1 author, Lara Lloret Iglesias</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has grown rapidly in the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning and widespread access to computing resources. Applications cover diverse imaging modalities, including those based on electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X-rays), subatomic particles (e.g., nuclear imaging), and acoustic waves (ultrasound). Each modality features and limitations are defined by its underlying physics. However, many artificial intelligence practitioners lack a solid understanding of the physical principles involved in medical image acquisition. This gap hinders leveraging the full potential of deep learning, as incorporating physics knowledge into artificial intelligence systems promotes trustworthiness, especially in limited data scenarios. This work reviews the fundamental physical concepts behind medical imaging and examines their influence on recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly, generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we describe physics-informed machine learning approaches to improve feature learning in medical imaging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biomarkers to predict, prevent, and treat persistent pain: omics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mark R Hutchinson, Daniel Barratt, +5 authors, Paul Rolan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Persistent pain represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating innovative biomarker technologies that facilitate personalised prediction, prevention, and treatment. Recent advances in omics, encompassing genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, lipidomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics, now permit high-resolution mapping of neuroimmune pathways implicated in pain chronification. Yet, biomarkers must transcend isolated molecular or sensory indicators, integrating emotional, cognitive, functional, and social dimensions of pain. Emerging quantum sensing technologies, such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy sensors and portable magnetoencephalography systems, promise precise and wearable tools capable of real-time, multimodal assessment of pain. Concurrently, transparent machine learning methods combining explainable artificial intelligence with physiologically informed modelling are crucial for managing the vast data complexity inherent to these multidimensional omics approaches. Ultimately, achieving economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and universally accessible pain management solutions requires strategically streamlined methods. Here, we outline a visionary framework of measurement-enabled understanding that enables precision pain medicine with rapid feedback that points toward actionable clinical outcomes, harnessing interdisciplinary innovation to address persistent pain comprehensively, just as genomics and immunotherapy have transformed cancer care.</p>
