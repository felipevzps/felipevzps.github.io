<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Broad-Chain-Length 3-Hydroxy Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Meng, H., Schwanemann, T., +3 authors, Blank, L. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 3-Hydroxy fatty acids (3-HFAs) are versatile intermediates for bio-based polymers, fuels, and surfactants, and are advancing circular economy manufacturing. We built an acyl-CoA ligase-deficient chassis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, thereby blocking 3-HFA activation and preventing its use as carbon source. This strategy decoupled synthesis from catabolism and enabled 3-HFA accumulation. We then compared two different routes for modifying the free 3-HFA composition. 1. In a direct route, overexpressing native PhaG produced C8, C10, C12, and C14 3-HFAs, achieving a total titer of 0.73 g/L in shake flasks. Functional analyses under our tested conditions support a re-assignment of PhaG: rather than acting primarily as a 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP:CoA transacylase, it functions mainly as a thioesterase, liberating free 3-HFAs from hydroxyacyl-ACP. 2. In an indirect route, overexpressing RhlA variants generated hydroxyalkanoyl-alkanoates (HAAs) that were converted to free 3-HFAs by endogenous esterase(s): RhlA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 favored C8-C12 and yielded 0.47 g/L 3-HFAs, whereas RhlA from Burkholderia plantarii PG1 favored C10-C14 with 0.14 g/L, of which 80% was C14. Finally, we demonstrated process feasibility by up-scaling the PhaG pathway in a stirred-tank reactor. These results establish modular, stable, chassis-compatible routes for tailoring 3-HFA chain-length distributions, thereby providing a foundation for scalable, bio-based monomer supply in a circular economy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spontaneous Emergence of Symmetry in a Generative Model of Protein Structure</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Oresten, A., Sato, K., +5 authors, Murrell, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Generative models are becoming powerful tools for protein design, enabling the creation of novel protein structures and sequences. Recent approaches have shown success using diffusion models and flow matching to sample realistic protein folds. Many methods explicitly incorporate structural biases or constraints - for example, enforcing symmetry during generation - to steer the design process. Here we report the spontaneous emergence of structural symmetry in a transformer-based generative model for proteins, without any symmetry-specific conditioning during training or constraints during generation. In our flow-matching model, a single attention head in an SE(3)-equivariant transformer layer was found to be primarily responsible for the model's ability to generate symmetric arrangements of backbone residues across chains, or repeating motifs within a chain. Our results show that protein generative models can learn high-level structural patterns implicitly from training data. This opens new questions about interpretability and control in generative design: understanding how and why a single attention head can govern a complex global property like symmetry may inform future model architectures and help exploit emergent behaviors for better protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Benchmarking Real-World Applicability of Molecular Generative Models from De novo Design to Lead Optimization with MolGenBench</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cao, D., Fan, Z., +7 authors, Zheng, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structure-based drug design (SBDD) has been profoundly reshaped by the advent of deep generative models, yet their practical impact on drug discovery remains limited. A central issue is the absence of a rigorous, application-oriented benchmark that mirrors the multi-stage, target-aware workflows of real-world pharmaceutical development. Inspired by recent advances in benchmarking for computer vision and large language models, where systematic evaluation has catalysed rapid progress, we introduce MolGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to close the gap between molecular generation algorithms and tangible drug discovery outcomes. MolGenBench integrates a structurally diverse, large-scale dataset spanning 120 protein targets, 5,433 chemical series comprising 220,005 experimentally confirmed active molecules. Beyond conventional de novo generation, it incorporates a dedicated hit-to-lead (H2L) optimization scenario, which represents a critical phase in hit optimization that is seldom evaluated in existing benchmarks. We further introduce novel, pharmaceutically grounded metrics that assess a model's ability to both rediscover target-specific actives or progressively optimize compounds for potency. Through extensive evaluation, MolGenBench uncovers significant gaps between current generative models and the demands of real-world drug development, establishing a foundational resource for building generative models with enhanced practical impact and accelerated translational potential.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">FADVI: disentangled representation learning for robust integration of single-cell and spatial omics data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, W., Qu, G., +2 authors, Zhao, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Integrating single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging due to strong batch effects across experiments and platforms. Existing methods focus on minimizing these effects but cannot disentangle technical variation from true biological signals. Here, we present FADVI, a variational autoencoder framework partitioning the latent space into batch-specific, label-related, and residual subspaces. By combining supervised classification, adversarial training, and cross-covariance penalty, FADVI enforces independent representations that preserve biological variation while correcting batch effects. Benchmarking across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics datasets, FADVI consistently outperformed state-of-the-art integration methods. FADVI also enables feature attribution, revealing genes associated with cell type identity and batch variation. Together, these results demonstrate that FADVI provides robust, interpretable integration for large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data, offering a powerful framework for downstream analysis and discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SOORENA: Self-lOOp containing or autoREgulatory Nodes in biological network Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Arar, H., Aldahdooh, J., +1 author, JAFARI, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Autoregulatory mechanisms, in which proteins modify their own activity or expression, are fundamental components of biological regulatory systems but remain challenging to identify systematically within the scientific literature. Manual curation is outpaced by publication growth, with self-regulation often described implicitly. To address the lack of automated tools for identifying protein autoregulatory mechanisms, we present SOORENA, a two-stage transformer-based model designed to predict and classify such mechanisms within PubMed abstracts. In Stage 1, the model determines whether a publication describes any form of protein autoregulation. In Stage 2, positive instances are further classified into one of seven mechanistic categories: autophosphorylation, autoubiquitination, autocatalytic activity, autoinhibition, autolysis, autoinducer production, and autoregulation. SOORENA was fine-tuned from PubMedBERT using a curated dataset of 1,332 experimentally validated abstracts sourced from UniProt-referenced publications. On a held-out test set, Stage 1 achieved an accuracy of 96.0% and a precision of 97.8%, effectively minimizing false positive propagation. Stage 2 demonstrated robust performance across all classes, with an overall accuracy of 95.5% and a macro-F1 score of 96.2%, including perfect classification for the two least-represented categories. Error analysis revealed that most misclassifications occurred between mechanistically related categories, suggesting that the model's learned representations reflect underlying biological relationships. We deployed SOORENA as a shiny app enabling interactive search, metadata-based filtering, and confidence-weighted prioritization of predictions alongside standardized ontology definitions to support scientific exploration. These results demonstrate that domain-specific language models can scale the discovery and curation of biologically critical self-regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Physics-Diffusion-Driven Multiscale Aggregation for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, J., Le, J., +5 authors, Yu, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drug-target interaction prediction is an important task in computational drug discovery. To address the limitations of existing graph neural network approaches in propagation depth and robustness, we propose PDDMA-DTI (Physics-Diffusion-Driven Multiscale Aggregation for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction), a physics-inspired, multiscale adaptive aggregation framework. PDDMA-DTI injects a physics-motivated diffusion operator into a heterogeneous drug-target network: global diffusion models cross-modal information propagation via the graph Laplacian, while local diffusion performs neighborhood smoothing in the low-dimensional embedding space. Both processes are solved with the implicit Euler scheme to ensure numerical stability. For each node, we introduce an adaptive stopping rule based on steady-state convergence and a weighted fusion strategy. This strategy leverages hop counts and node degrees to aggregate multi-step diffusion snapshots into a final representation that preserves original features while capturing multi-scale context. To emphasize strong interaction pathways, we further propose a Physical Interaction Summation Enhancement module that augments pairwise interaction features with a linear plus quadratic energy term, thereby amplifying highly correlated drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that PDDMA-DTI consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy and robustness.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">annoSnake: a Snakemake workflow for taxonomic and functional annotation of metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Heimburger, B., Clement, R., Hartke, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Omic technologies revolutionised research in microbiomics and helped decipher the complex community structure of gut microbiota, each comprising hundreds of species of bacteria, archaea, and protists. Even as sequencing costs decrease, understanding these communities remains a challenge. Here, we introduce annoSnake, a Snakemake workflow that facilitates taxonomic and functional annotation of metagenomes and metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs). This user-friendly and highly flexible workflow integrates state-of-the-art software packages, taking raw sequencing reads, assembling them into contigs, assigning taxonomies and annotating them using various popular protein databases. The workflow handles paired-end as well as interleaved read data, and provides publication-ready figures and tables for downstream analysis. annoSnake, as all Snakemake workflows, is highly scalable, reproducible, and portable, enabling execution across diverse high-performance computing environments with remarkable efficiency.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring the Structural Lexicon of the Proteome via Metric Geometry</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gunther, E., Camara, P. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The three-dimensional structure of proteins is intimately linked to their function, yet establishing comprehensive frameworks for systematically comparing and organizing protein structures across the proteome remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce GWProt, a computational framework that leverages recent advances in metric geometry, such as Gromov-Wasserstein couplings, for protein structure alignment and analysis. GWProt enables the integration of biochemical information into structural comparisons and introduces the concept of local geometric distortion, a measure that captures local conformational differences. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by identifying conformational switches within individual proteins, detecting functional domains shared among evolutionarily distant viral proteins, revealing topological rearrangements in homologous folds, and uncovering recurrent short structural motifs underlying functional domains across the human proteome. Collectively, these results establish the use of metric geometry as a versatile and quantitative framework for the systematic comparative analysis of protein structures, complementing existing approaches for elucidating protein organization.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Design and Development of DNA Damage Chemical Inducers of Proximity (DD-CIP) for Targeted Cancer Therapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qiu, T., Lee, Y. T., +10 authors, Gray, N. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many chemotherapies are effective against cancers that display high levels of genome instability by disrupting or overwhelming the DNA damage response to induce cell death. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) exploit this vulnerability by stalling DNA repair particularly in homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancer cells. Although PARPi are now used to treat BRCA1/2-mutated cancers such as ovarian and breast cancers, they are still limited to a narrow range of clinical indications and are susceptible to acquired resistance. Here, we introduce 'DNA Damage Chemical Inducers of Proximity' (DD-CIPs), bivalent molecules that rewire the mechanism of action of conventional PARPi. The DD-CIPs function through chemical induced proximity between PARP1/2 and the chromatin remodeling protein, BRD4. From a candidate library of DD-CIPs, we identified DD-CIP1 which induces the DNA damage response (DDR) and apoptosis to a range of cancer lines at two-digit nanomolar concentrations. Further optimization yielded DD-CIP2, which induces tumor cell death at nanomolar concentrations across diverse blood and solid cancer cells, including cancer types that are insensitive to PARPi. Using small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a model, we found that DD-CIP2 triggers DDR, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vitro, leading to anti-tumor efficacy without substantial toxicity in preclinical SCLC xenograft models at well tolerated doses. Our findings demonstrate that DD-CIPs may provide an opportunity to address the limitations of traditional PARPi and establish chemical induced proximity as a strategy for modulating the DDR in cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AXL mediates mast cell survival and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mastocytosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kangboonruang, K., Drabent, P., +33 authors, Maouche-Chretien, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder driven by KIT mutations, yet resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a major challenge. Following the discovery of an AXL L197M mutation in a patient with congenital aggressive mastocytosis, we demonstrated unexpected expression of wild-type AXL in neoplastic mast cells (MCs) across mastocytosis subtypes, challenging current knowledge of mastocytosis pathophysiology. Interestingly, AXL was undetectable in steady-state MCs, whereas various factors including IFN- and IFN-{beta} induced its expression, consistent with the inflammatory nature of mastocytosis and elevated interferon levels detected in patient plasma. Ectopic expression of WT or L197M AXL in the ROSA KIT D816V cell line enhanced proliferation and survival by upregulating pSTAT5, pSTAT3, pFAK, p-p38, survivin and BCL2. Both AXL forms conferred resistance to the KIT inhibitor PKC412/midostaurin by sustaining BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL expression while reducing caspase-3 activation. Although L197M AXL induced slightly higher resistance to apoptosis than WT, no major differences observed. Combined KIT and AXL targeting (PKC412+R428) restored TKI sensitivity by downregulating BCL-XL, Livin, cIAP1, and activating caspase-3, highlighting the therapeutic potential of dual KIT/AXL pathway inhibition. Importantly, neoplastic MCs from a mast cell leukemia patient unresponsive to PKC412 and carrying the KIT F522C mutation strongly expressed AXL and displayed marked in vitro sensitivity to R428 alone, highlighting AXL as a potential therapeutic target in agressive mastocytosis not driven by KIT D816V. Collectively, these findings identify AXL as a previously unrecognized driver of malignant MC survival and TKI resistance, and support AXL inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in aggressive mastocytosis.</p>
