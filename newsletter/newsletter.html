<h2 class="paper-title">Sequence-based models for RNA-Protein interactions imputation might be insufficient for novel signal prediction in eCLIP data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rybakov, A., Khlebnikov, D. A., +3 authors, Mironov, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting specific RNA-protein interactions remains a challenging task: despite the existence of numerous methods, a unified approach has yet to emerge. Additional difficulties emerge from the properties of in vivo IP experiments and their systematic biases, such as the overrepresentation of highly expressed RNAs. Here, we present the PLERIO machine learning framework, which utilizes eCLIP data for a single protein to reconstruct the full spectrum of its potential interactions with the cellular transcriptome (i.e., both highly expressed and lowly expressed RNAs). In an effort to extrapolate our methodology to a multi-protein paradigm for de novo prediction of RNA-protein interactions on proteins lacking available eCLIP data, we extended our approach to 220 cellular proteins. We then demonstrate that this approach might not be well tailored to the limitations of current in vivo immunoprecipitation data and may only be meaningful for in vitro experiments such as RNAcompete.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating SHAPE Probing with Direct RNA Nanopore Sequencing Reveals Dynamic RNA Structural Landscapes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">White Bear, J., De Bisschop, G., +1 author, Waldispühl, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional SHAPE experiments rely on averaged reactivities, which may limit information on folding patterns, alternate structures, and RNA dynamics. Short-read sequencing often suffers from false stopping, stalls, and biases during reverse transcription. The introduction of direct, long-read nanopore technology offers an opportunity to expand RNA structure probing methods to better understand RNA structural diversity. While many comparative approaches have been developed for detection of endogenous modifications, fewer have explored the expansion of SHAPE-based methods. We introduce Dashing Turtle (DT), an algorithm using probabilistic, weighted, stacked ensemble learning to perform high-resolution detection of structural modifications that can capture detailed information about RNA architecture across dynamic structural landscapes. We apply our method to several well-characterized RNA samples, identify dominant conformations, and structurally conserved regions. We show that our landscapes correlate well with expected structures and recapitulate important functional elements. DT achieves accuracy 10-20% higher than comparable methods on many sequences. It accurately identifies structural features at a rate of 80-100%, approximately 10-30% better than its peers. DT's predictions are robust across replicates and sub-sampled datasets and can help detect changes in conformational states, inform RNA folding mechanisms, and indicate interaction efficiency. Overall, it expands the capabilities of direct RNA sequencing and structural probing.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Jiang, W., Ding, Y., +3 authors, Li, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> By sensing local conformational strains in DNA, TaqMutS utilizes a push-pull mechanism via the synergy of residues S57 and D472 to modulate {pi}-stacking interactions between the key recognition residue F39 and DNA, thereby achieving specific mismatch-site recognition. Meanwhile, residues K61 and R473 fine-tune non-specific binding of TaqMutS through electrostatic synergy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Graph topology reframes the coherence of cell-state manifold inference under heterogeneous single-cell observations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tamura, T., Yamane, Y., +2 authors, Sakurada, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Manifold-based single-cell omics analyses assume that high-dimensional observations can fall into a low-dimensional space encoding biological constraints. In practice, per-cell observation is highly heterogeneous: shallowly- and deeply-observed cells coexist. In an empirical scRNA-seq dataset, shallowly-observed cells cluster together to generate spurious hubs that can give rise to illusory loops in low-dimensional manifold skeletons in graph abstraction. Several imputation methods leave these artifacts largely intact, whereas graph abstraction restricted to homogeneously-observed cells alone recovers tree-like structures locally representing constrained cell state transitions. Simulations further demonstrate that realistic heterogeneous observation can create spurious subclusters and false branching. Grounded by these observations, we propose topological stability descriptors of low-dimensional manifold skeletons to delineate a regime in which manifold-based inference is trustworthy despite realistic heterogeneous observations. Our findings underscore that the heterogeneity of observations is not merely noise but a source of systemic distortion in manifold-based inference that must be addressed.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Finger Type Classification for Fingerprint Image Error Correction in Large Scale Biometric Databases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sakif, T. I., Dawson, J., Nasrabadi, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large-scale biometric systems, essential for national security and border management, increasingly rely on multimodal databases containing millions of identities. However, operational pressures and insufficient training lead to frequent image classification and labeling errors by human operators. These critical data integrity issues include the mislabeling of rolled vs. flat fingerprints, out-of-sequence captures, and the insertion of incorrect modalities. Such errors render enrollment records unreliable, compromising subsequent identity verification processes. Since manually sorting vast image archives is unfeasible, our study proposes an automated solution. The primary objective was to deploy a Siamese Network to classify fingerprints by their precise finger type and collection methodology (flat or rolled impressions). A secondary, but central, goal was to investigate the influence of varying embedding dimensions (64, 128, 256, 512) and similarity thresholds (0.5, 0.2, 0.1) on the network's performance metrics. Our most significant finding demonstrates a clear trade-off: a lower similarity threshold drastically increases conditional accuracy and precision (e.g., up to 98%) but simultaneously increases the proportion of images categorized as "uncertain" (up to 24%). In a practical, large-scale application, this necessitates balancing superior classification accuracy against a higher volume of images requiring costly manual inspection. This work provides a proof-of-concept tool capable of efficiently quantifying the percentage of images requiring human review across various modalities (fingerprints, face, iris). The eventual goal is a lightweight, efficient tool to establish standard preprocessing procedures for any large biometric dataset, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with data integrity maintenance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep learning inference of universal dormancy pseudotime reveals the cellular targets of anti-cancer therapies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Beckmann, H. M., Tong, M., +1 author, Steif, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Controlled exit from and re-entry into the cell cycle is essential for multi-cellular life, while aberrant quiescent and senescent cell states have been implicated in age-related diseases and cancer treatment evasion. Recent molecular and imaging studies suggest non-cycling cellular states exist along a continuum of deepening dormancy, whereby the probability of cell cycle re-entry decreases with distance from the restriction point. We trained a probabilistic deep-learning model that enables mapping of heterogeneous single cell transcriptomic datasets into an interpretable latent space that encodes a common "dormancy pseudotime". We demonstrate that our model enables robust inference of active cell cycle states, and validate in diverse biological contexts that the inferred location along dormancy pseudotime represents a continuum from quiescence to durably arrested states. Applying dormancy pseudotime inference to pre- and post-treatment time points from patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment, we uncover new insights into the distinct tumour cell dormancy states targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-taxane chemotherapy. Given the ubiquity of single cell transcriptomics, we anticipate that dormancy pseudotime analysis will be widely applied to shed new light on the complex interplay between cycling and non-cycling cellular states in health and disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">De novo design of protein competitors for small molecule immunosensing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">de Stigter, Y., Godschalk, T., Merkx, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Competition-based immunoassays are a common strategy for detecting small-molecule biomarkers. However, these assays rely on the availability of a custom competitor molecule that can effectively be displaced upon analyte binding, often requiring time-consuming synthesis and conjugation steps. De novo designed protein binders present a compelling alternative, as their binding properties can be tuned and they allow for straightforward genetic-incorporation into existing immunoassays. Here, we leverage the BindCraft pipeline to design competitive binders by targeting antigen-binding sites, followed by in silico filtering to select for steric clashes with the small-molecule analyte. As a proof of concept, we designed digoxin competitors and experimentally screened the binders using a simple bioluminescent assay, identifying 7/10 successful binders directly in bacterial lysate. These binders exhibited low to moderate binding affinities (Kd = 42 nM - 1.1 uM) and were displaced by digoxin. Two de novo binders were encoded into a previously established competition-based immunosensor, enabling sensitive digoxin detection (Kd = 109 nM). These results demonstrate that deep learning-based models can rapidly yield effective competitor binders, enabling straightforward adaptation and optimization of sensing platforms for small-molecule targets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantitative profiling of millions of nucleotides reveals sequence-encoded interactions that govern plasmid propagation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Copeman, T., Fong, J. H. C., +4 authors, Ceroni, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Plasmids are central to modern biotechnology, especially therapeutic development, yet their propagation in Escherichia coli remains difficult to predict. Although expression-induced burden is well understood and can be mitigated, the impact of foreign DNA segments that do not function in bacteria on plasmid propagation and stability remains largely unknown. Here we developed a pooled, sequencing-based framework that performs quantitative profiling across millions of bases, enabling high-resolution assessment of plasmid fitness at scale and revealing cryptic, sequence-encoded interactions between foreign DNA elements and bacterial hosts. Promoter-like motifs, transcription factor binding site homology, and recombination-prone architectures emerge as major determinants of propagation efficiency, with context-dependent effects demonstrating that plasmid behaviour arises from higher-order interactions between parts rather than isolated elements. Extending this framework, we introduce TRACE, a neural-network model trained on degenerate sequence libraries that predicts plasmid propagation directly from sequence. TRACE generalises across plasmid architectures and can be fine-tuned on experimental datasets to improve predictions of manufacturability and host compatibility. These advances establish a generalisable, data-driven framework for understanding and designing host-aware plasmids, transforming plasmid production from an empirical process into a predictable property of DNA sequence.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GlycanGT: A Foundation Model for Glycan Graphs with Pretrained Representation and Generative Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kitani, A., Zhang, B., +1 author, Matsui, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation Glycans are highly diverse biological sequences, but their functional understanding has lagged behind that of proteins and nucleic acids. Many glycans remain incompletely characterized or ambiguously annotated, limiting computational analyses. Existing computational approaches are primarily graph-based, capturing local structural features but struggling to model global patterns and incomplete sequences. Results We present GlycanGT, a foundation model for glycans built on a graph transformer architecture. Glycans were represented as graphs with monosaccharides as nodes and glycosidic bonds as edges, and the model was pretrained using a masked language modeling objective. GlycanGT demonstrated higher performance than existing methods across 8 benchmark classification tasks (e.g., 0.734 Macro-F1 in domain prediction and 0.844 AUPRC for immunogenicity classification), and its embeddings formed biologically meaningful clusters that recovered known N- and O-glycan categories. Moreover, GlycanGT accurately proposed candidates for ambiguous sequences, maintaining &gt;80% top-5 accuracy for both monosaccharide and glycosidic bond predictions under high masking levels. Availability and implementation The pretrained GlycanGT model weights and usage scripts are available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/Akikitani295/GlycanGT. Additional scripts used for analyses in the paper are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/matsui-lab/GlycanGT.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Untangling or further entangling? Revelation of the complicated world of nucleic acid quadruplex folds</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rathinavelan, T., Sundaresan, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid secondary structures playing diverse biological roles. A recent meticulous analysis of known quadruplex structures formed from synthetic oligonucleotides shows that quadruplexes can take 33 distinct structural motifs (pair of stacked quartets) that act as scaffolds for simple (multi-layered quartets) and complex (multi-motifs) quadruplex folds. These motifs differ from one another in terms of interstrand connectivity and orientation. The connectivity is primarily governed by diagonal loops that connect alternate strands, and lateral and propeller loops that connect adjacent strands. These loops are absent in the tetramer, wherein interstrand orientation alone dictates the motif type. Nevertheless, a key question that remains unresolved is the complete structural landscape of quadruplex motifs, limiting our understanding of the fold-dependency in various biological functions and diseases. To address this, a total of 156 unique theoretically possible quadruplex motifs are mathematically devised here. A tool named 3D-NuS-Qplex (https://project.iith.ac.in/3d-nus-qplex/) has also been developed to model all the theoretically possible energy-minimized quadruplex folds with the options to incorporate overhangs and non-G-quartets (in addition to G-quartets) in both DNA and RNA contexts. The diversity of quadruplex motifs reported here provides new insight into their structural complexity, which appears greater than previously anticipated.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Bessler, N., Wezenaar, A. K. L., +25 authors, Rios, A. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a rare yet highly aggressive paediatric cancer primarily arising in the pontine region of the brainstem, necessitating the development of scalable patient-representative models for treatment advance. Here, we developed an FGF4-driven human brainstem organoid model, with high representation of pontine glial lineages. By genetically engineering de novo H3.3K27M-altered DMG, we show that this brainstem glial specification is essential for driving DMG tumorigenesis, resulting in tumours that recapitulate the infiltrative nature and molecular heterogeneity of patient samples. By performing prolonged GD2 CAR T cell treatment in this model, we could mirror variable treatment outcomes as observed in the clinic and demonstrate a high level of CAR T cell transcriptional heterogeneity. From these CAR T cell functional states, we could identify the most potent effector population and validated NCAM1 as a selection marker for their enrichment. In contrast, NCAM1- cells were linked to a cellular stress response, previously associated to immunotherapy resistance. Furthermore, incorporating the brain-resident myeloid compartment resulted in DMG-specific, largely immunosuppressive microglia subtypes. These disease-representative microglia reduced GD2 CAR T cell treatment efficacy and we identified the functional profiles most susceptible to this microglia-dependent immune modulation. Thus, we present a scalable human DMG model with critical applications towards understanding CAR T cell functionality to aid therapy development for this detrimental disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The role of autoproteolysis and mitoribosomal proteins in regulation of mitochondrial LACTB tumor suppressor</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Escudeiro-Lopes, S., Gonzalez-Morena, J. M., +11 authors, Keckesova, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumor suppressors represent one of the first lines of defense against malignant transformation and their inactivation in cells leads to onset of tumorigenesis. Cancer cells employ a variety of ways to inactivate cellular tumor suppressors, such as their epigenetic silencing or mutagenesis. Less understood are mechanisms by which cancer cells inactivate tumor suppressors post-translationally. Here, we uncovered a previously undescribed post-translational strategy that cancer cells use to inactivate the potent mitochondrial tumor suppressor LACTB in breast cancers. We discovered that substrate of LACTB can be LACTB itself; that LACTB possesses autoproteolytic ability, which is important for the modulation of its tumor suppressor activity. We show that cancer cells misuse this feature of LACTB to force LACTB into self-degradation. This is mechanistically realized through upregulation of mitochondrial MRPS34 protein, which, through interaction with LACTB, is a positive regulator of the autoproteolytic activity of LACTB and a negative regulator of LACTB. This study, through in vitro, in vivo, human clinical tumor samples and mutagenesis, provides important new insights into how cancer cells fine-tune the expression and activity of tumor suppressors to promote tumorigenesis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Model for the Diversity Explosion Fundamental to Metastasis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">O'Brien, E. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most deaths from cancer are caused by their metastases. Along with the ability to evade the immune system and to invade and disrupt very different tissue environments, metastases usually develop resistance to whatever therapeutic approaches are tried. Their extreme adaptability requires a diversity of traits from which natural selection can choose, but current models, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), do not directly address how this diversity is generated. We observed that single cell clones of Panc1 human pancreas cancer cells that had had crispR knock outs (KO) of the gene for activin-like kinase 4 (ALK4) had developed a markedly diverse morphology. Time-lapse and fluorescence microscopy, FACS analysis and mitotic chromosome squashes provided evidence that the cells diversify profoundly in size, behavior and chromosome number. This diversity appears to develop through cytokinesis failure, the generation of very large multinuclear cells that exhibit a high range of nuclear configurations, coupled with continued cell divisions that sometimes generate three, four, and more daughter cells in one cell division. This astounding activity often resulted in cells that were much smaller than the normal Panc1 cells, and indirect evidence suggests they were significantly sub-ploidy, yet underwent regular cell divisions. A subset of the smaller cells were highly motile, and were observed to sometimes merge together or even into larger cells. This phenomenon could provide an unappreciated venue for transferring mutated genes, chromosome fragments, whole chromosomes or sets of chromosomes into an invaded cell. We suggest that these observations may be a serendipitous illustration of the missing link between the genetic mutations implicated in the development of primary carcinoma, and the extreme genomic diversity that characterizes malignant metastases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RPRM (Reprimo) triggers SCF(FBXW11)-mediated DNA-PKcs degradation to block non-homologous end joining and radiosensitize tumors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Z., Zhang, Y., +7 authors, Yang, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeting DNA damage repair pathways represents a promising strategy in cancer radiotherapy, however, the limited insight into the regulation of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway in cancer cells severely restricts the development of precise radiosensitization approaches. Here, we identify Reprimo (RPRM), a p53-inducible tumor suppressor, is a potent inhibitor of NHEJ in which RPRM promotes proteasomal degradation of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) phosphorylated at the T2609 site. Upon irradiation, RPRM quickly translocates into the nucleus to enhance the transcription of FBXW11, a F-box protein gene that encodes the substrate recognition component of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. In the nucleus, RPRM is also able to scaffold the assembly of the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex by binding to both CUL1 and FBXW11. This complex can specifically ubiquitylate phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609), leading to reduced levels of both phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609) and total DNA-PKcs, thereby suppressing NHEJ-driven repair and enhancing tumor radiosensitivity. In consistence, inhibiting the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex eliminates RPRM-mediated radiosensitization by protecting DNA-PKcs. Clinically, high RPRM expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) predicts better patient prognosis. Moreover, RPRM expression correlates positively with FBXW11 and PRKDC (DNA-PKcs) in the tumor tissues of the NSCLC patient cohort. Significantly, high expression of RPRM protein is linked to enhanced radiosensitivity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from these NSCLC patients. These results establish RPRM as a key negative regulator in NHEJ repair pathway and the RPRM-SCF(FBXW11)-DNA-PKcs axis as a potential target to enhance cancer radiosensitivity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Aptamer-Fortified VV-GMCSF-Lact for Systemic Glial Tumor Virotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dymova, M., Koshmanova, A., +9 authors, Richter, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Virotherapy represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, when administered intravenously, oncolytic viruses are often hampered by neutralization from anti-bodies, reducing their antitumor efficacy. Aptamers offer a potential solution by shielding viral particles from neutralizing antibodies and prevent viral particle aggregation. In this study, human glioblastoma xenografts were orthotopically implanted in immunocompromised ICR mice. The therapeutic agents (VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt1, VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt2 or VV-GMCSF- Lact) were administered intravenously. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we observed a decrease in tumor growth in all experimental groups. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, it was shown that the mouse survival in the VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt1, VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt2 groups was higher than in the control group. The level of key cytokines (IL-1, IL-10, TNF-alpha) in mouse plasma was measured using ELISA. A study of cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-10, and TNF-) showed that the aptamers shift the immune response from a pro-inflammatory systemic response, by reducing IL-1, to an anti-tumor one, with an increase in TNF-. In histological analysis, the most destructive changes in tumor tissue were observed in the VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt2 group, while the morphology of organ tissues (spleen, liver, kid-neys and lungs) did not differ between the control and experimental groups. Thus, our results demonstrate a synergistic antitumor effect of the aptamer in combination with the oncolytic virus against glioblastoma tumor xenografts.</p>
