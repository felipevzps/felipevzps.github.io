<h2 class="paper-title">Drug Response Prediction Provides a Biologically Relevant Benchmark for Perturbation Response Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Brouwer, N., Damyanov, M., +3 authors, Wessels, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Perturbation response models (PRMs) predict transcriptional responses to interventions such as gene knockout or drug treatments. While simple baseline models match PRMs in reconstructing post-treatment profiles, we show that drug response predictors trained on PRM-generated profiles significantly outperform those trained on baseline or pre-treatment profiles. Unlike simple baseline models, PRMs preserve variation in response-relevant genes, making them a highly valuable tool for predicting drug response.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Limitations of the refolding pipeline for de novo protein design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Korbeld, K. T., Viliuga, V., Fürst, M. J. L. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the emergence of powerful deep learning-based tools, computational protein design has become a widely accessible technique. Nowadays, it is possible to perform both sequence and structure design in a matter of minutes, making the technology attractive to the broader scientific community. In protein design campaigns, one of the most common in silico strategies to evaluate how well a sequence encodes a target structure is the so-called self-consistency or refolding pipeline. In this approach, a structure prediction model is used to refold the designed sequence to probe whether it is compatible with the intended structure, and is evaluated via two metrics linked to experimental success: the confidence score of the predicted structure (pLDDT) and the self-consistency root-mean-square deviation (scRMSD), which measures how closely the refolded structure matches the target. In this work, we systematically evaluate how different models and structure prediction settings impact these metrics, and to what extent they can be used to reliably filter sequence design candidates. We show that evolutionary information can obscure folding models' abilities to assess sequence-structure compatibility, reducing the predictive performance of refolding metrics for experimental success, particularly for designs that share homology with natural sequences. We further highlight limitations of refolding metrics, including their sensitivity to structural features, such as flexibility. Our findings raise awareness of potential pitfalls in refolding-based evaluation and support more informed use of these metrics in protein design campaigns.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Riemannian Metric Learning for Alignment of Spatial Multiomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Halmos, P., Xia, Y., Raphael, B. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent spatial technologies measure the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome and other modalities from thousands of cells across a tissue. Most assays typically profile only one modality from a tissue slice, raising the question of how to align spatial data from heterogeneous feature spaces. While multiple approaches have been developed for multi-modal integration of single-cell datasets, few existing techniques perform spatial alignment across arbitrary modalities incorporating both spatial and feature information. We introduce Manifold Gromov-Wasserstein (MGW), a metric-learning framework that exploits the product structure of spatial multiomics to infer modality-specific Riemannian pull-back metrics with neural fields. MGW aligns Riemannian distances induced by these metrics via Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport, yielding a hyperparameter-free cost across arbitrary modalities sharing a spatial base. The formulation enjoys theoretical invariances - including orthogonal transformations of the spatial and feature domains as well as global feature scalings. We demonstrate the advantages of MGW on multiple alignment tasks, including Stereo-Seq spatiotemporal transcriptomics of mouse embryo, Xenium and Visium spatial transcriptomics of colorectal cancer, and spatial metabolomics-transcriptomics from human striatum and kidney cancer. MGW recovers biologically meaningful correspondences and spatially coherent tissue structures, outperforming existing OT- and non-OT-based multi-modal baselines.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Anti-CRISPR-mediated continuous directed evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sabol, A. L., Mengiste, A. A., +15 authors, Shoulders, M. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Engineering CRISPR-Cas systems for improved or altered function is central to both research and therapeutic applications. Unfortunately most optimization, especially directed evolution in bacterial hosts, fails to capture the functional requirements of the complex mammalian cellular milieu, where activity is usually required. Robust strategies to enable continuous directed evolution of genome-targeting agents directly in human cells remain lacking. Here, we introduce CRISPR-MACE (Mammalian cell-enabled Adenovirus-assisted Continuous Evolution) as a foundational technology to address this need. CRISPR-MACE integrates virus-based continuous evolution with anti-CRISPR-based tunable selection to generate novel Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 variants with both increased and decreased DNA binding capacity and nearly 1000-fold-enhanced resistance to AcrIIA4, the strongest known inhibitor of SpCas9. Notably, across independent evolution campaigns the same Cas9 gatekeeper mutation reproducibly emerged first, enabling subsequent adaptive steps along two interdependent axes of Cas9 function. In addition to advancing CRISPR technologies, this work establishes key principles and synthetic circuits for continuously evolving CRISPR-Cas systems directly in human cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Temporal Perturbation Scanning: AI-Driven Deconstruction of Universal Biomolecular Recognition Mechanisms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Azzaz, F., Fantini, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the physicochemical principles governing intermolecular recognition remains a fundamental challenge across biochemistry, drug discovery, and synthetic biology. While molecular dynamics simulations capture interaction dynamics and machine learning models predict binding affinities, neither provides a systematic approach to deconstruct recognition mechanisms into their fundamental physical components across time. Here we present Temporal Perturbation Scanning (TPS), an AI framework that universally decomposes intermolecular interactions into electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric contributions across binding stages. Our method: i) combines graph neural networks with interpretable, multi-faceted in silico mutagenesis to automatically process biomolecular complexes, ii) applies targeted physicochemical perturbations, and iii) quantifies residue-specific importance through statistical effect sizes. Crucially, TPS achieves this mechanistic insight with orders-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency than traditional mutation simulations, extracting equivalent information from single trajectories that would otherwise require dozens of independent simulations. Applied to neurotoxin-receptor and other biomolecular systems, TPS reveals fundamentally different engagement strategies and stage-dependent interaction patterns, demonstrating its capacity to capture mechanistic variation across complexes. Beyond resolving these biological insights, our framework provides a generalizable computational platform for mechanistic analysis across diverse molecular interactions, enabling researchers to move beyond predicting whether molecules interact to understanding how and why they recognize one another through interpretable, physicochemical decomposition across time.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">OddSNP: a predictive framework for optimizing multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq experiments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Allendes Osorio, R. S., Nishimura, T., +2 authors, Nemoto, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Donor multiplexing is a powerful strategy to increase scale, lower the costs, and reduce batch effects in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), but clear guidelines for experimental design are lacking, forcing researchers to risk costly demultiplexing failures. To address this, we introduce SNP-Information Content (SNP-IC), a quantitative metric computable from simple unpooled pilot data that accurately predicts the success of genotype-based demultiplexing. Across multiple large-scale datasets using stem cell and organoid models, we establish a robust SNP-IC threshold of approximately 50, above which cells can be reliably assigned to their donor of origin. For more challenging genotype-free approaches, we define a pairwise metric, cpSNP-IC, and demonstrate a much higher requirement of approximately 3,000. Our open-source framework, oddSNP, implements this predictive model, allowing researchers to perform in silico titrations of sequencing depth and donor complexity to optimize experimental design before committing to large-scale studies. oddSNP provides a practical framework, enabling researchers to strategically optimize sequencing depth and donor numbers to maximize experimental success while managing costs and minimizing the risk of catastrophic data loss.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Meta-PseU: A Meta-Classifier for Robust Prediction of RNA Pseudouridine Modification Sites from Long Sequences</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sutou, T., HARUN-OR-ROSHID, M., Kurata, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pseudouridine ({Psi}) represents one of the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved RNA modifications. {Psi} provides an additional hydrogen-bond donor that enhances RNA structural stability and modulates translation. It participates in diverse biological processes, including RNA-protein interactions, splicing, translational control, and stress responses. Aberrant pseudouridylation is implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Despite its biological importance, experimental identification of {Psi} sites remains time-consuming and costly, limiting the feasibility of transcriptome-wide profiling. Computational approaches have therefore become essential complements to experimental techniques. However, current machine-learning and deep-learning predictors suffer from limitations such as small datasets and limited generalizability. To overcome these issues, we have constructed new long-sequence datasets derived from RMBase 3.0 and developed Meta-PseU, a logistic regression-based meta-classifier that stacks multiple single-feature or baseline classifiers across three species of human, mouse, and yeast. Meta-PseU substantially reduced the performance gaps between training and independent test datasets, presenting superior generalization. Meta-PseU substantially outperformed state-of-the-art predictors and achieved increasing accuracy with increasing sequence length. This work offers a new framework for robust {Psi}-site identification by using long sequences. The datasets and programs are freely accessible at https://github.com/kuratahiroyuki/MetaPseU.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative Assessment of the Utility of Co-Folding and Docking for Small-Molecule Drug Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Roehrig, U. F., Mathieu-Bugnon, M., Zoete, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep-learning based co-folding methods predict the structures of proteins interacting with metal ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, peptides, and other proteins. One of their main objectives is their application for drug design, predicting the structure of small-molecule ligand/protein complexes. It has been shown that at present these models memorize ligand poses from the training data but do not generalize effectively to novel complexes and lack in the adherence to physical and chemical principles. Here, we use the recently introduced Runs N' Poses benchmark set of 2,600 protein-ligand systems annotated by their similarity to the training data, to show that the physics-based docking algorithms Attracting Cavities and AutoDock Vina outperform co-folding methods for novel ligands and novel binding pockets. In addition to predicting ligand poses and at variance with co-folding methods, they provide a physical rationale on why a ligand binds (or does not bind) and insight into experimental structural model deficiencies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProteoBench: the community-curated platform for comparing proteomics data analysis workflows</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Devreese, R., Jachmann, C., +37 authors, Schnei</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a well-established strategy for analyzing complex biological mixtures. Many MS instruments and data acquisition strategies are available, and the data they acquire differ substantially, thus requiring tailored analysis algorithms. Hence, many dedicated bioinformatics workflows are developed. These are in constant evolution, and the community lacks a centralized platform for comparing their performance. Here, we propose ProteoBench, a single platform that brings together software developers and software users to provide an ever-evolving comparison of state-of-the-art proteomics data processing tools. ProteoBench is an open-source resource that enables the community to evaluate data analysis workflows, develop benchmarking modules dedicated to specific comparisons, and discuss the best methods to compare software tools. The platform ensures that the benchmark evolves alongside advances in proteomics data analysis workflows. ProteoBench guides researchers towards the best-suited tool and parameters for their specific project and data according to their needs, and developers can test their newly developed tools or workflows privately, before adding them as public references. This community-driven effort will increase transparency and reproducibility between MS data analysis workflows, as well as facilitate the development and publication of software workflows in the field.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BacTaxID: A universal framework for standardized bacterial classification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fernandez-de-Bobadilla, M. D., Lanza, V. F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bacterial strain typing is key to surveillance, outbreak investigation and microbial ecology, yet current systems remain species-specific, reference-dependent and lack a universal, interpretable metric of genomic relatedness. Here, we introduce BacTaxID, a fully configurable, whole-genome k-mer-based framework that encodes each genome as a numeric sketch and organizes strains into hierarchical clusters with user-defined similarity thresholds. BacTaxID distances are strictly proportional to Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), providing a direct quantitative link between vectorial typing and genome-wide divergence. Applied to 2.3 million genomes from All the Bacteria across 67 genera, BacTaxID demonstrates universal concordance species and sub-species classification systems, while capturing finer strain-level diversity than traditional reference-based approaches. In simulated surveillance and real outbreak datasets, BacTaxID reproduces SNP and cgMLST-based definitions while enabling rapid, scalable screening. Precomputed genus-level schemes and an open implementation provide a practical, genus-agnostic alternative to classical typing systems for standardized bacterial classification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pan-cancer analysis reveals genomic fidelity and evolution of patient-derived organoids</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Raz, L., Ben-Yishay, T., +6 authors, Ben-David, U.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are gaining recognition as a promising ex vivo model for cancer research, offering advantages over traditional 2D cell lines by better recapitulating tumor biology. In this study, we assess the genomic stability and evolution of PDOs by analyzing copy-number alterations (CNAs) in 261 PDO samples across 15 cancer types. These results are compared with data from previously analyzed patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We observe that PDOs exhibit genomic evolution over passaging, with an increasing divergence from the original tumor genome over time. Importantly, across cancer types, PDOs maintain higher genomic fidelity and are more genetically similar to their tumors of origin than PDX models. Moreover, PDOs show greater genomic stability during culture passaging compared to PDXs. These findings position PDOs as a potentially more reliable and representative model for cancer research, offering an alternative with better genomic stability for translational studies and drug testing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biomarker Quantification in Breast Cancer using Xenium In Situ</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Janesick, A. S., Kravitz, S. N., +2 authors, Taylor, S. E. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in spatial transcriptomics enable high-throughput quantitation of both established and novel biomarkers at single cell resolution, offering the potential to transform diagnostics. Using Xenium in situ technology in FFPE human breast samples, we address two challenges in the cancer field: 1. achieving reliable normalization of gene expression across heterogeneous sample populations; 2. identifying biomarkers that predict invasion or metastasis. We describe a scalable approach to identify low-variation housekeeping (HK) genes within any given sample set, then use those HK genes for cross- and intra-sample normalization of biomarkers. Analyzing 12 FFPE human breast samples--primarily ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)--with a custom 280-gene panel, we identified four HK genes (EEF1G, EEF2, MALAT1, and RPLP0) that exhibited minimal variability in tumor cells, four tumor cell biomarkers (LDHA, SDC1, PIGR, SFRP1) that increased or decreased with tumor grade, and one tumor-associated myoepithelial biomarker (LAMC2). Normalizing biomarkers to the four HK genes preserved the dynamic range of expression necessary for distinguishing tumor grades, outperforming HKs from legacy RT-PCR diagnostic panels. Lastly, we employed a cell-agnostic approach in the tumor periphery to quantify MMP11, a biomarker correlated with proliferative and potentially pre-invasive ducts. Our results establish a single cell normalization method for spatial in situ transcriptomics and reveal and quantitate biomarkers relevant to DCIS risk and progression.</p>
