<h2 class="paper-title">EcoKMER: One-stop shop for spatio-temporal metagenomic exploration using DataFed</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">George, A., Leach, D., +12 authors, Johnson, C. G. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatially distributed environmental sampling generates highly complex and multidimensional datasets illuminating key insights into microbial diversity, evolutionary-coevolutionary processes, and host-pathogen interactions. While these sampling methods generate high value datasets, dataset size, the dataset integration, visualization, analysis, and provenance tracking present significant bottlenecks to scientific discovery. To address this bottleneck, we developed EcoKMER, an R-Shiny front-end application designed to streamline metagenomic data accessibility and provide geospatial context to data in support of hypothesis-driven investigations into environmental sampling, supported by DataFed as its back-end data management platform. EcoKMER enables interactive visualization and filtering of harmonized metagenomic data and metadata using an interoperable approach, allowing users to extract spatially distributed sample-based metadata on top of environmental parameters such as geolocation, temperature, pH, for investigating ecological changes across time and space enhancing sample processing methods. As an example, we deployed this tool to track analysis of metagenomes from the organisms in the Salish Sea Estuary, consistent with existing community-accepted standards. Built on top of DataFed, a flexible and robust scientific data management system built for data lakehouse architectures, EcoKMER is positioned as a powerful tool to improve sampling strategy decision making, accelerate new insights for collaborative biological and environmental research, and fostering AI-ready analyses designed to enhance discovery and guidance for bioeconomic engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PURE makes PURE: reconstitution of the PURE cell-free system from self-synthesized non-ribosomal proteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mottaghi, S. S., Maerkl, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Building a universal biochemical constructor, an autonomously self-replicating biochemical system, is a major challenge in synthetic biology. The PURE cell-free system is an ideal starting point for exploring self-regeneration, and its 36 non-ribosomal proteins constitute the primary macromolecular components that must be regenerated. Here, we demonstrate that the PURE system can be reconstituted from proteins synthesized by PURE itself. We first show that each of the 36 non-ribosomal proteins can be individually synthesized in PURE. We then purify the PURE synthesized proteins as pooled subsets and reconstitute a fully functional PURE system by combining the subsets. Finally, we show that all 36 non-ribosomal PURE proteins can be synthesized simultaneously in a single PURE reaction and, after purification, can reconstitute a functional PURE system. Together, these results establish that the non-ribosomal protein components of the PURE system can be self-regenerated, representing a critical step toward the realization of a universal biochemical constructor.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Horseradish peroxidase as an electrochemical reporter protein for cell-free biosensors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ruhela, A., Liyanagedera, S. B. W., +1 author, Marland, J. R. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell-free biosensor systems offer a promising platform for portable diagnostics. However, most employ fluorescent reporter proteins that require complex instrumentation and can be affected by photo-bleaching and auto-fluorescence, limiting translatability. Electrochemical reporters do not suffer from these drawbacks. Here, we evaluate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a redox enzyme reporter for cell-free biosensor systems. HRP was synthesized in an E. coli cell-free transcription-translation system supplemented with hemin, calcium acetate, and commercial disulfide bond enhancers. The electrochemical detection of its activity was established by chronoamperometry, with H2O2 as a substrate and tetramethylbenzidine as a redox mediator. Cell-free expressed HRP produced a strong steady state current compared to a catalytically inactive mutant and a no-template control. Kinetic analysis showed a Km for the cell-free expressed HRP close to that of the native enzyme. To explore the potential of HRP as an electrochemical reporter, we placed it under the control of a tetracycline-responsive regulatory promoter and demonstrated a 3-fold current increase in the presence of anhydrotetracycline. These results support HRP as an electrochemical reporter for cell-free biosensors, offering a practical alternative to optical reporters for future use in handheld analytical devices.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tunable light-focusing behavior of engineered bacterial microlenses with controllable shapes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sidor, L. M., Sage, K. P., +7 authors, Meyer, A. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, engineered bacterial cells have been shown to behave as optically-active photonic devices comparable to industrially fabricated microlenses1. Bacterial cells can be encapsulated within a layer of polysilicate through surface display of the sea sponge enzyme silicatein, which mineralizes a polysilicate coating. The addition of this polysilicate layer significantly enhances the ability of these cells to guide, scatter, and focus light. However, this previous technique was limited to creating rod-shaped microlenses, which are not ideal for all applications. Here we expand upon this technology by engineering the shapes of silicatein-displaying bacterial cells. Through the overexpression of the genes bolA and sulA or through the use of the drug A22, we are able to alter Escherichia coli cells from their characteristic rod-like shape to either spherical or filamentous forms. Round cells encapsulated in polysilicate were shown to scatter light more intensely and symmetrically than rod-shaped cells, while encapsulated filamentous cells were shown to guide light similarly to an optical fiber. This control over the size and shape of optically-active cells is a major advancement towards developing bio-engineered photonic devices such as nanophotonic waveguides, spherical microlens arrays, and advanced biosensors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A scalable architecture for tuning multistate differentiation ratios in synthetic microbial consortia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sasson, C., Capin, J., +10 authors, Bonnet, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Establishing synthetic microbial consortia in competitive environments is often compromised by stochastic colonization bottlenecks, where founder effects lead to the unpredictable dominance of a single strain. Here, we overcome this challenge by engineering a differentiation abacus, a scalable, single-layer recombinase architecture that enables a single progenitor cell to differentiate into up to twelve distinct subpopulations. By arranging competitive excision sites in a linear array, we demonstrate that differentiation ratios can be programmed through rationally tuning recombination-site kinetics and inter-site spacing. This architecture allows the generation of strictly mutually exclusive phenotypes with tunable composition, scaling from simple two-state systems to complex multi-state ensembles without the need for multilayered regulation. Finally, we validate the utility of the system in a mouse tumor model, showing that in situ differentiation establishes robust, homogeneous consortia that overcome the colonization variability associated with pre-assembled mixtures. This work provides a versatile and scalable framework for reliably controlling consortia composition for bioproduction, synthetic ecology, and engineered living therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mapping Gene Impact on Single-cell Transcriptomic Networks via Perturbation Response Scanning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gupta, S., Romero, S., Cai, J. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene knockout experiments are essential for dissecting gene function, and CRISPR has made targeted gene disruption more accessible than ever. Single-cell CRISPR screening enables the construction of rich genetic perturbation landscapes, facilitating the identification of genes whose perturbation strongly reshapes cellular states. However, due to the nonlinear dependencies within gene networks, identifying the most impactful tangible genes remains challenging. Existing virtual knockout methods estimate downstream effects of single-gene deletions but do not evaluate whether such perturbations disrupt global information flow or compromise cellular robustness. To address this limitation, we adapt a perturbation-response framework originally developed for protein structural dynamics to identify gene modules most susceptible to perturbation. We introduce the single-cell Perturbation Impact Index (scPII), a data-driven metric derived from gene regulatory networks that quantifies system-level responses to gene perturbations, without using any CRISPR screening information. Our results demonstrate that scPII effectively identifies genes whose perturbation has the greatest system-wide impact. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia revealed a strong correlation between scPII-derived gene impact scores and gene effect scores from genome-wide CRISPR screens. These findings indicate that scPII provides a robust metric for quantifying gene knockout effects. More broadly, integrating perturbation response scanning with gene regulatory networks offers a powerful framework for advancing single-cell data analytics in biomedical research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GTcomplex: Spatial indexing-powered search and alignment of macromolecular complexes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Margelevicius, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structural alignment of macromolecular complexes is essential for understanding their function and evolution, yet existing methods often rely on aligning individual chains before inferring complex-level correspondences, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. Here we present GTcomplex, a novel algorithm that employs spatial indexing to perform holistic complex-level alignment, directly deriving chain assignments from optimal global superpositions. Benchmarking on diverse datasets---including protein complexes, viral capsids, and nucleic acid complexes---demonstrates that GTcomplex achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with substantial speed improvements over current methods. These advances enable scalable, accurate comparison of compositionally diverse and large assemblies, facilitating structural annotation, evolutionary studies, and multimeric structure prediction. GTcomplex is available as a user-friendly software package and as a web service supporting high-throughput searches.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">WxS-QC - a quality control pipeline for human Whole-Genome and Whole Exome sequencing cohorts</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zakharov, G., Eberhardt, R., +9 authors, Iyer, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome (WGS) sequencing are rapidly becoming preferred methods for population-scale analysis of the human genetic landscape. However, there are currently no standardized quality control (QC) pipelines for human WES and WGS datasets. Moveover, there are no open datasets that can be used to test QC pipelines, because most projects (like 1000 genomes and gnomAD) publish only post-QC results. We present WxS-QC, a powerful, scalable, and convenient pipeline for the QC of human WGS and WES cohorts, developed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI). Our pipeline is based on a deep refactoring of the gnomAD quality control pipeline code and is aligned with current best practices in WGS/WES cohort data QC. It offers a set of novel QC techniques, automatic export of resulting graphs and summary tables, excellent performance and scalability, and incorporates comprehensive documentation. To test our pipeline and similar solutions, we also assembled an open dataset with all required metadata. The pipeline code is written in Python using the Hail library and is freely available under the BSD-3 license here: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/wxs-qc. It can run in any UNIX-like environment and has been able to efficiently process cohorts of up to 200,000 whole-exome samples with the potential to handle bigger datasets, depending on the available hardware. The detailed description of the pipeline, resources and test data is available in the pipeline documentation: https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/wxs-qc/blob/main/README.md The open test dataset is available to download from https://wxs-qc-data.cog.sanger.ac.uk/wxs-qc_public_dataset_v3.tar. An example of test dataset analysis is available in the supplementary materials.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">On Deriving Synteny Blocks by Compacting Elements</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bohnenkaemper, L., Parmigiani, L., +1 author, Stoye, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genomic rearrangements are major drivers of evolution and genetic disease. However, studying rearrangements requires segmenting the genomes of interest into conserved regions, called synteny blocks, that highlight structural differences between genomes. Synteny blocks are typically defined from annotated genes or derived as a by-product of whole-genome alignments. As these procedures are heuristic and do not explicitly model rearrangements, they can obscure real variation, create false similarities, and affect phylogenetic inference. The importance of synteny block definition has long been recognized, as shown for example by discussions on breakpoint reuse, where different definitions of synteny blocks led to different estimates of rearrangement complexity in mammalian genomes. We present a formal framework for deriving synteny blocks directly from sequence data by partitioning genomic elements into blocks that do not contain breakpoints. A breakpoint is defined between a pair of genomes as an adjacency of shared elements that occurs in one genome but not in the other. Synteny blocks are therefore not allowed to span such boundaries, ensuring that rearrangements are not obscured. The framework is fully agnostic to the type of genomic element and applies to any genome representation expressed as sequences of elements, such as non-overlapping alignments, exact matches (MUMs/MEMs), k-mers, unitigs or minimizers. We formalize two optimization problems: minimizing the total genome length after replacement by synteny blocks (the Minimum-Length Synteny Block Problem) and minimizing the number of distinct blocks (the Minimum-Size Synteny Block Problem). We show that both problems are NP-hard in general. However, when blocks are required to be collinear and to contain a conserved element, we provide a linear time algorithm with respect to the number of input elements that simultaneously minimizes both objectives. The resulting method is simple, efficient, and produces large synteny blocks without obscuring rearrangements.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">slideimp: Efficient Imputation for DNA Methylation Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pham, H., Lombroso, A. P., +1 author, Taylor, H. S., O'Donnell, K. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: There is a growing need for efficient imputation methods for high-dimensional DNA methylation (DNAm) datasets. Existing microarray imputation approaches, such as k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) or principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods, provide high accuracy but can be computationally intensive, while methods for whole-genome data are not designed for large cohorts. We developed slideimp, an R package that implements sliding window, groupable, parallelized K-NN and optimized PCA imputation to address these limitations. Results: Benchmarks on microarray DNAm datasets demonstrate that slideimp achieves up to 150x faster runtime and 10x-100x lower memory usage while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy over existing methods and implementations. For K-NN and PCA imputation, slideimp supports grouped imputation which enhances imputation efficiency and accuracy. In a whole-genome dataset, sliding window K-NN imputation substantially increased the correlation of the Horvath 2013 clock with chronological age from 0.131 to 0.477. Additional features include targeted imputation of CpG subsets for K-NN and estimation of imputation accuracy via repeated cross-validation. The efficient and flexible DNAm imputation methods implemented by slideimp can easily be applied to other high-dimensional data types. Availability and Implementation: The code to fully reproduce all analyses presented in this paper is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hhp94/slideimp_paper. The R package slideimp is also available on GitHub at https://github.com/hhp94/slideimp. Supplemental figures are available online.</p>

Normal organoids were more resistant than tumor organoids to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin in both EO-CRC and late-onset CRC (LO-CRC) patients. However, for SN38, this therapeutic window was observed in LO-CRC but not in EO-CRC patients, revealing age-dependent differences in drug resistance. We also evaluated the effect of calcitriol, the active vitamin D metabolite with anti-CRC activity, on drug sensitivity. Calcitriol reduced the cytotoxicity of 5-FU and SN38 in normal organoids regardless of patient age, while it selectively decreased their cytotoxicity in EO-CRC but not in LO-CRC tumor organoids. This protective effect correlated with calcitriol antiproliferative action and transcriptional effects on drug-metabolism pathways. These findings identify clinically relevant age-dependent differences in chemotherapy response and support vitamin D-based strategies to design age-tailored precision treatments.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">mRNA and Protein Expression of Fetal Insulin Receptor in Breast Cancer Cell Lines</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, X., Barrios, A., +5 authors, Yee, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The insulin receptor (IR) is expressed in breast cancer cells and plays a role in regulating tumor biology. There are two IR isoforms generated from the same gene. Alternate splicing with exclusion or inclusion of exon 11accounts for the two isoforms. The exon 11 excluded isoform (IR-A) is expressed during fetal development while the full-length adult IR (IR-B) is the primary form expressed during adult life. This splice variant results in a 12 amino acid variation in peptide sequence. Breast cancer cells overexpress IR-A with an increased IR-A:IR-B ratio. Most of these data were obtained by examining mRNA expressions. In this work, we examined over 40 breast cancer cell lines and patient tumor samples for mRNA expression of the IR isoforms to show that most cells overexpressed IR-A compared to IR-B. Further we used mass spectrometry to demonstrate IR-A protein expression in the Du4475 cell line which has a high level of IR-A mRNA expression. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of IR-A protein expression. Thus, IR-A mRNA and protein expression demonstrate a potential role for this insulin receptor isoform in breast cancer biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthesis of mRNA lipid nanoparticles for engineering GD2 CAR T and CAR NK cells against neuroblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chang, C.-C., Shi, L., +5 authors, Galipeau, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Engineering T and natural killer (NK) cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) creates effective adoptive cell transfer therapies for cancer treatment. However, using viral transduction as a primary genetic modification method adds regulatory burdens and is expensive to produce at scale. Delivering mRNA encoding CAR via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been explored as a potent non-viral method to generate CAR immune cells. Still, it has not been optimized for CAR treatment of neuroblastoma to date. An LNP formulation to deliver mRNA encoding a GD2 CAR into human T and NK cells was designed and characterized by dynamic light scattering for size distribution, z-average diameter, polydispersity index, and {zeta} potential. Fluorescent reporter detection persisted for more than 1 week after mRNA LNP transfection, without affecting T or NK cell viability. The potency of GD2 CAR T cells with 79.9% reporter positivity and GD2 CAR NK cells with 26.6% reporter positivity was assessed in vitro against the GD2+ neuroblastoma cell line CHLA20. GD2 CAR T or CAR NK cells could effectively target and kill neuroblastoma cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and GD2 CAR T cells showed increased IFN{gamma} production. This study shows mRNA LNPs are a promising non-viral approach for generating GD2 CAR T and CAR NK cells, potentially offering a safer and more cost-effective alternative to current viral vector-based methods.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Thiol Scarcity in Cerebrospinal Fluid Renders Leptomeningeal Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Therapeutically Vulnerable to Ferroptosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gajic, N., Christie, R., +18 authors, Halsey, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The leptomeninges present a challenging tumour microenvironment with cells receiving low levels of nutrients and oxygen from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), however these metabolic constraints are yet to be exploited therapeutically. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) remains a formidable clinical challenge because the leptomeningeal niche restricts drug penetration and immune surveillance. Current CNS-directed treatments rely on neurotoxic intrathecal chemotherapy, underscoring the urgent need for novel targeted strategies. Here, we uncover a profound niche-specific metabolic vulnerability in CNS-resident ALL cells, characterised by an obligate reliance on LRP8-mediated selenium uptake to sustain selenocysteine biosynthesis and GPX4 activity under profound glutathione limitation. We show that scarcity of thiols and cystine in CSF creates an inherently pro-ferroptotic microenvironment. Interference with selenocysteine biosynthesis under these conditions induces synthetic lethality in both in vitro and in vivo CNS-ALL models. This vulnerability is exploitable both by genetic targeting of the selenocysteine biosynthesis pathway and, notably, through repurposing the FDA-approved agent Auranofin, which disrupts selenium utilisation, induces lipid peroxidation, and demonstrates CNS-specific anti-leukaemic efficacy with excellent tolerability in vivo. These findings identify a novel mechanistically grounded approach, leveraging features of the unique leptomeningeal microenvironment to selectively kill invading cells, with potential implications for all leptomeningeal-tropic malignancies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comprehensive molecular characterization of high-stemness gastric cancer cells using single-cell transcriptomics, spatial mapping, and machine learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ziyi Wang, Xuehao Li, +5 authors, Wanfu Men</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gastric cancer (GC) remains a global clinical challenge due to late diagnosis, high heterogeneity, and poor prognosis. Tumor stemness has emerged as a key factor driving tumor aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance. However, the systematic characterization of high-stemness GC cells and their molecular features remains limited. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq data to identify and characterize high-stemness GC cells. Stemness scores were calculated using CytoTRACE, and malignant cells were classified into high stemness (top 25% CytoTRACE-scored cells, HighStem), dynamic transition stemness (DTStem), and low stemness (LowStem) subpopulations based on the quartile method cutoff. ScPagwas and cell-cell communication profiling were used to explore genomic instability, genetic susceptibility, and microenvironmental interactions. HighStem-specific co-expression modules were identified via high-dimensional WGCNA (hdWGCNA), and features were screened using six machine learning algorithms. A benchmark model was constructed for HighStem prediction and interpreted using SHAP analysis. HighStem GC cells exhibited enhanced intercellular signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and stemness-related pathway activity. Five genes-APMAP, MAPRE1, GLB1, TSPAN6, and CDKN2A-were identified as robust HighStem features. Spatial and bulk transcriptomic validation confirmed their tumor-specific expression and prognostic relevance. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model incorporating these genes achieved high accuracy (AUC = 0.973) in distinguishing HighStem cells, demonstrating strong clinical utility at the scRNA-seq level. In addition, experimental validation through knockdown of core genes (APMAP, CDKN2A, TSPAN6, MAPRE1, and GLB1) in SGC7901 and HGC-27 gastric cancer cell lines revealed a significant reduction in JAK1-STAT3 pathway activity, supporting their functional involvement in tumor stemness regulation. Furthermore, knockdown of these genes increased the sensitivity of GC cells to chemotherapeutic agents like 5-FU and cisplatin, indicating their potential role in chemoresistance. This study provides a comprehensive molecular and functional characterization of high-stemness GC cells. The identified signature genes and predictive models offer novel insights into GC stemness biology and could guide personalized therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the core genes identified in this study may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes and monitoring therapeutic resistance in GC.</p>
