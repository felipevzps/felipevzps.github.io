<h2 class="paper-title">Beyond single biomarkers: multi-omics strategies to predict immunotherapy outcomes in blood cancers.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mohammad Pirouzbakht, Soroosh Hamzeh, Hamed Soleimani Samarkhazan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immunotherapy has revolutionized hematologic cancer treatment, yet responses remain unpredictable due to primary resistance, relapse, and life-threatening toxicities. Conventional biomarkers fail to capture the complexity of tumor-immune interactions, necessitating integrative approaches. This review explores how multi-omics technologies, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, spatial omics, and microbiome profiling, decode the molecular drivers of immunotherapy efficacy and adverse events in hematologic malignancies. We highlight key advances: genomics reveals neoantigen landscapes and HLA diversity shaping checkpoint inhibitor responses; transcriptomics identifies T-cell exhaustion signatures predictive of CAR-T failure; metabolomics uncovers lactate-driven immunosuppression in AML; and spatial omics maps immune architectures linked to Hodgkin lymphoma outcomes. Supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, support vector machines) integrate these layers to build predictive models for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and resistance, while longitudinal ctDNA monitoring enables dynamic therapy adaptation. Emerging frontiers like CRISPR-based epitope editing, digital twins for in silico clinical trials, and non-coding RNA biomarkers further refine precision strategies. Despite challenges in data integration, tumor plasticity, and ethical frameworks, multi-omics is accelerating biomarker-driven trial designs (e.g., basket trials with omics stratification) and patient-centric tools (wearable sensors for real-time metabolite tracking). This review distinguishes itself by synthesizing these rapid technological advances not only to predict outcomes but also to chart a forward-looking roadmap for their clinical translation, offering a unique perspective on overcoming the current barriers to precision immuno-oncology. Together, these advances promise to transform immunotherapy from empirical to precision medicine, optimizing outcomes for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma patients.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modeling and minimization of dCas9-induced competition in CRISPRi-based genetic circuits</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jatkar, D. D., Al-Radhawi, M. A., +1 author, Sontag, E. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Implementing logic functions in living cells is a fundamental area of interest among synthetic biologists. The goal of designing biochemical circuits in synthetic biology is to make modular and tractable systems that perform well with predictable behaviors. Developing formalisms towards the design of such systems has proven to be difficult with the diverse retroactive effects that appear with respect to the context of the cell. Repressor-based circuits have various applications in biosynthesis, therapeutics, and bioremediation. Particularly using CRISPRi, competition for components of the system (unbound dCas9) can affect the achievable dynamic range of repression. Moreover, the toxicity of dCas9 via non-specific binding inhibits high levels of expression and limits the performance of genetic circuits. In this work, we study the computation of Boolean functions through CRISPRi based circuits built out of NOT and NOR gates. We provide algebraic expressions that allow us to evaluate the steady-state behaviors of any realized circuit. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the effective non-cooperativity of any given gate is a major bottleneck for increasing the dynamic range of the outputs. Further, we find that under the condition of competition between promoters for dCas9, certain circuit architectures perform better than others depending on factors such as circuit depth, fan-in, and fan-out. We pose optimization problems to evaluate the effects engineerable parameter values to find regimes in which a given circuit performs best. This framework provides a mathematical template and computational library for evaluating the performance of repressor-based circuits with a focus on effective cooperativity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genetic incorporation of diverse non-canonical amino acids for histidine substitution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Natter Perdiguero, A., Fischer, S., +2 authors, Deliz Liang, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Using genetic code expansion, canonical amino acid residues can be site-specifically substituted by non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) with modified chemical properties. This technique has enabled detailed enzymatic studies, the design of enzymes that catalyze novel reactions, and the engineering of enzymes with improved function. In proteins, histidine can play versatile roles in catalysis including as an acid, a base, a nucleophile, and a coordinating ligand to a catalytic metal. However, the current scope of histidine-like ncAAs that can be incorporated is limited. Herein, we develop a toolkit consisting of nine new aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs for the site-specific genetic encoding of an expanded set of 12 new histidine-like ncAAs. The 12 ncAAs feature broadly tuned nitrogen pKaH, alternative heterocycles, and varying substitution patterns. We profile the substrate specificity of the developed aaRS/tRNA pairs and uncover many mutually orthogonal substrate specificities, which we validate for six combinations of dual encoded histidine-like ncAAs. We expect that the tools presented herein will be broadly applicable to study histidine residues in catalysis and to tune the properties of histidine residues for enzyme engineering and design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring the Conformational Landscape of Adenylate Kinase and Beyond: A Benchmark of Protein Folding Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bhasin, A., Delaunay, A. P., +1 author, Fu, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein folding models have revolutionized structure prediction but struggle to capture conformational flexibility. Recent studies perturb inputs or parameters to sample alternative conformations, while diffusion-based approaches generate conformational ensembles directly. Although the former have been benchmarked to some extent, the latter have yet to be evaluated, and sub-domain dynamics validation remains limited. Here, we present a systematic benchmark of nine methods across 20 monomeric proteins with active and inactive states. We extend the pairwise aligned error metric to ensembles and reveal that protein identity exerts a non-negligible influence on model performance. Focusing on Adenylate Kinase, a well-studied enzyme with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) data, we find that Chai-1 performs the best in recovering known conformations, identifying mobile regions, and capturing transition trajectories. These results highlight the potential of generative models as efficient alternatives to MD for exploring protein conformational dynamics and provide a rigorous benchmark for dynamic structure prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Phylogeny-Informed Random Forests for Human Microbiome Studies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Koh, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Random Forest is a widely used tree-based ensemble learning algorithm that efficiently captures complex nonlinear relationships and higher-order feature interactions with no distributional assumptions to be satisfied. It is also well-suited to human microbiome studies, where the data are highly skewed, overdispersed, discrete, and irregular. Here, I pay particular attention to the phylogenetic tree information that reflects evolutionary ancestry and functional relatedness among microbial features. Proper incorporation of phylogenetic tree information into microbiome data analysis has provided new insights and improved analytical performance. In this paper, I introduce an extension of the Random Forest algorithm that incorporates phylogenetic tree information, named Phylogeny-Informed Random Forests (PIRF), to improve predictive accuracy in human microbiome studies. The core mechanism of PIRF lies in its localized approach; rather than treating all features as competing globally to be selected or weighted, PIRF identifies informative features within each phylogenetic cluster (i.e., a localized group of microbial features that are evolutionarily and functionally related), thereby enriching functional representations while reducing tree correlation. I demonstrate the high predictive accuracy of PIRF, compared with other off-the-shelf tools, across seven benchmark tasks: four classification problems (gingival inflammation, immunotherapy response, type 1 diabetes, and obesity) and three regression problems (cytokine level, age based on oral microbiome, and age based on gut microbiome). Importance: PIRF is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm that incorporates phylogenetic tree information to improve predictive accuracy in human microbiome studies. PIRF can serve as a useful tool for microbiome-based disease diagnostics and personalized medicine. The software and tutorials are freely available as an R package, named PIRF, at https://github.com/hk1785/PIRF.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantifying predictability of gene expression from histology image</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xia, C.-R., Yao, J.-W., Gao, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Histopathological images are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, yet provide limited insight into underlying molecular states. Numerous computational models attempt to predict gene expression from histopathological images. However, a fundamental question remains unresolved: which genes can be accurately predicted and which cannot. Here, we introduce Expression Predictability Score (EPS), a metric that quantifies the predictability of each gene from images through expression-image mutual information. Empirical analyses across more than 500 slices further reveal consistent sets of highly predictable and unpredictable genes, as well as their underlying association with the physicochemical nature of H&amp;E staining.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">On the Thermodynamic Consequences of Oscillatory Dynamics in Image Processing: Application of Gas Molecule Models and Hierarchical Meta-Information Data Structures in Life Sciences Image Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sachikonye, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This work presents a novel thermodynamic computer vision framework for biological image analysis that reformulates traditional image processing problems within the con text of statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics. The approach treats image pixels as information-carrying entities analogous to gas molecules, where pixel intensities represent energy states and spatial relationships correspond to intermolecular forces. The framework integrates three primary computational modules: Gas Molecular Dynamics for thermodynamic foundation and structural segmentation, S-Entropy Coordinate System for four-dimensional semantic representation, and Meta-Information Extraction for high-level biological interpretation. The Gas Molecular Dynamics module converts biological image features into information gas molecules with thermodynamic properties including position, velocity, mass, and interaction parameters. Molecular evolution follows classical dynamics principles through modified Lennard-Jones potentials that incorporate biological similarity factors. The system evolves toward equilibrium configurations that reveal underlying biological organization through emergent clustering patterns. TheS-Entropy Coordinate System transforms conventional spatial coordinates into entropy based coordinates capturing structural complexity ({xi}1), functional activity ({xi}2), morphological diversity ({xi}3), and temporal dynamics ({xi}4). This four-dimensional representation enables quantitative analysis of biological patterns through thermodynamically motivated measures while providing semantic interpretation of biological organization. The Meta-Information Extraction framework analyzes information content and compression characteristics through automated classification of information types, semantic density analysis, and structural complexity quantification. Integration with molecular dynamics and S-Entropy coordinates enables multi-scale analysis combining detailed molecular configurations with abstracted coordinate representations. Experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements through module integration compared to isolated operation. Molecular dynamics clustering accuracy increases from 0.73 plus/minus 0.08 to 0.89 plus/minus 0.05, S-Entropy semantic classification improves from 0.67 plus/minus 0.12 to 0.84 plus/minus 0.07, and meta-information extraction accuracy advances from 0.58 plus/minus 0.15 to 0.91 plus/minus 0.04, representing a 57% improvement. Computational efficiency gains of approximately 35% are achieved through unified thermodynamic representation and elimination of redundant calculations. The framework is applied to fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy data, demonstrating specialized analysis capabilities including multi-channel colocalization analysis, time-series processing, ultrastructural classification, and morphological characterization. The thermodynamic approach provides both theoretical rigor through adherence to physical principles and practical improvements in analytical performance for life sciences applications. The cross-module integration achieves effectiveness through synergistic interactions where each component amplifies the analytical capabilities of others. The molecular dynamics module provides thermodynamic foundation, the S-Entropy system integrates molecular information into semantic representations, and meta-information extraction synthesizes multi-scale insights for biological interpretation. This work establishes thermodynamic principles as a viable framework for biological image analysis with quantifiable improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Direction-Driven Feature Engineering for Low-Data BiologicalClassification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qurashi, S. U.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present Topology-Driven Directed Flow (TDDF), a practical feature engineering method for biological classification in low-data regimes. Inspired by the metaphor of water flowing through a straw leaning toward a fixed destination, TDDF extracts three interpretable features from high-dimensional biological space (1) flow coordinate along a learned direction field, (2) shape feature capturing local geometric deviations, and (3) topology feature encoding neighborhood structure. TDDF is a synthesis of established techniques (Fisher's LDA, residual analysis, local density estimation) applied with biological insight. Applied to TCGA breast cancer data, TDDF achieved 0.992 AUC (95% CI: [0.988, 0.997], pvalue = 0.001) in distinguishing tumor from normal tissue -significantly outperforming raw features (0.985 AUC) and PCA (0.980 AUC). The learned direction field automatically identified known luminal breast cancer genes (ESR1: r=0.876, pvalue &lt; 0.001; GATA3: r=0.823, pvalue &lt; 0.001). Most critically, TDDF demonstrated superior performance in low-data regimes, achieving 0.852 AUC with only 50 training samples compared to 0.783 for XGBoost. Code and full statistical validation are available at https://github.com/ubaidqurashi1/topologydriven.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MotifAE Reveals Functional Motifs from Protein Language Model: Unsupervised Discovery and Interpretability Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hou, C., Liu, D., Shen, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein motifs are conserved elements that mediate processes such as folding, binding, catalysis, and post-translational modifications. While motif identification is critical for protein study, experimental methods are labor-intensive, only a few hundred motifs are cataloged in databases like ELM, and existing supervised models are typically limited to predicting motifs with a specific function. Here, we present MotifAE, an unsupervised framework for discovering functional motifs from the protein language model ESM2, which captures evolutionary-scale sequence regularities. MotifAE is based on the sparse autoencoder (SAE), an encoder-decoder architecture that projects ESM2 embeddings into a sparse latent space, with an additional local similarity loss that encourages coherent latent feature activations. When benchmarked against known ELM motifs, MotifAE achieves a median AUROC of 0.88, outperforming the standard SAE (0.80). We also calculated Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for MotifAE features and found that features with similar decoder weights share similar PSSMs. Furthermore, by aligning MotifAE features with experimental data through gated feature selection, we identified features associated with specific properties such as folding stability. Steering these features enabled designing proteins with enhanced stability, as evaluated in silico. Overall, MotifAE provides a general framework for systematic motif discovery and interpretation, with the potential to advance protein function analysis, mutation effect interpretation, and rational protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cell-line specific role of Cathepsin B in triple-negative breast cancer growth, invasion and response to chemotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kelley, C., Guarin, J. R., +4 authors, Oudin, M. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cathepsins are papain-family cysteine proteases known to play a cell-intrinsic role in protein degradation in the lysosome, as well as in digesting ECM and surface proteins after being secreted. Both of these functions are known to mediate pro-tumorigenic effects of CTSB in a range of cancers. Here, we specifically investigate the role of CTSB in TNBC, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, where we find that high expression of CTSB in TNBC is associated with better outcomes. We used CRISPR to knockout CTSB in two highly metastatic TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, and find different effects. In MDA-MB-231 cells, knockout of CTSB has no effect on cell viability, increases tumor cell 3D invasion in an ECM-independent manner, and increases sensitivity to many standard of care chemotherapy drugs. However, in MDA-MB-468 cells, knockout of CTSB increases cell viability, decreases tumor cell 3D invasion, in an ECM-independent manner, and drives resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs without affecting response to others. We find that in these cells, CTSB is not secreted, and that differential downstream mTOR and Akt activation can explain the differences seen in these phenotypes. Overall, our studies demonstrate that CTSB can regulate TNBC cell phenotypes via its lysosomal cell-intrinsic role, but that effects are cell-line specific, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the role of CTSB in TNBC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Differential Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling via TCF7L2/LEF1 Binding Specificity Shapes Cellular and Tumor Phenotypes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kluiver, T. A., Nordin, A., +8 authors, Peng, W. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mechanisms by which Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling regulates gene expression in a tissue- and context-specific manner remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to target the aberrant cell growth typical of many Wnt-driven cancers. Here we focus on malignant liver tumors driven by activating CTNNB1 ({beta}-catenin) mutations that nevertheless display distinct phenotypic states and Wnt outputs. By profiling patient-derived organoids via single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin dynamics, we identify subtype-specific transcriptional and epigenetic profiles. Using CUT&amp;RUN, we show that {beta}-catenin engages distinct genomic regions, dictated by differential association with TCF/LEF family transcription factors. Specifically, we define a novel sequence-specific regulatory element engaged by {beta}-catenin only upon interaction with TCF7L2, revealing that partner choice, independent of CTNNB1 mutational status, ultimately determines cell fate. Our findings, validated across multiple tumor models and patient tissues, offer a framework for understanding how differential {beta}-catenin-TCF/LEF interaction orchestrates context-specific Wnt signaling outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Longitudinal investigation of prostate tumor spheroid proliferation with dynamic line-field optical coherence tomography</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Swanson, S., Chen, K., +2 authors, Bizheva, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, it has become widely recognized that culturing cancer cells in vitro in small, 3D aggregates known as tumor spheroids provides a more physiologically relevant model of in vivo tumor behavior compared to 2D monolayer cultures. Dynamic optical coherence tomography (dOCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that, by analyzing temporal fluctuations in the light scattered from biological tissue, does not require exogenous contrast agents to visualize and quantify cellular activity within 3D cell cultures. However, recent volumetric dOCT studies have encountered challenges due to low acquisition speeds. In this study, we present morphological and dynamic analyses of prostate tumor spheroid growth over a two-week longitudinal period, utilizing volumetric imaging with a line-field dOCT platform. Our method clearly differentiated between active cellular metabolism in live spheroids and the lack of activity in spheroids fixed with formaldehyde. Quantitative validation of the dynamic signal was conducted using the Alamar Blue proliferation assay, while qualitative validation was provided by live/dead fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification and validation of liquid biopsy-based methylation biomarkers: a germ cell tumor subtype-specific study</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Janssen, F. W., Gillis, A. J. M., +4 authors, Looijenga, L. H. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human germ cell tumors (GCTs) occur in infants, children, and adults, and present as germinomatous and/or non-germinomatous (embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, yolk sac tumor (YST), and choriocarcinoma) histologies at gonadal or extragonadal locations. Accurate subtyping is crucial for prognosis and treatment, but current clinical biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity (serum proteins) or require a tissue biopsy (immunohistochemistry). Hence, less-invasive and improved subtype-specific biomarkers have potential for clinical utility. We conducted a meta-analysis of DNA methylation data (450K/EPIC array) from 15 (three original and 12 published) datasets including 713 GCTs, 109 healthy testis, and 221 healthy peripheral blood samples, revealing that GCT histology is the primary driver of methylation profiles, regardless of tumor location and patients age or sex. Per subtype, we identified differentially methylated regions as potential biomarkers. As proof of concept, we identified and validated two YST-specific biomarkers, i.e., APC and DPP7 promotor methylation, using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-based qPCR, of which DPP7 was also detectable in GCT serum-derived cell-free DNA. In conclusion, we present a novel method for in silico identification and in vitro and in vivo validation of YST subtype-specific liquid biopsy-based biomarkers. Our bioinformatic pipeline is easily transferrable encouraging additional applications in pan(pediatric)-cancer studies beyond GCTs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Immune infiltration is linked to increased transcriptional activity and distinct metabolic profiles in chordomas</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">van Oost, S., Ursem, R., +8 authors, Bovee, J. V. M. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chordomas are ultra-rare cancers from the axial skeleton with limited treatment options. Chordomas can exhibit immunogenic features, and immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated clinical activity in some patients, yet the determinants of these responses remain poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the biological basis of immunogenicity in chordomas through spatial transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. We applied GeoMx digital spatial profiling to 15 chordomas, analyzing tumor and stromal compartments separately and comparing inflamed and non-inflamed tumors. Consecutive tissue sections were examined using MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) at 20 m spatial resolution. Findings were further explored through immunohistochemistry analyses. To assess whether transcriptional activity in tumor cells was associated with interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, we tested the effect of IFN-{gamma} treatment on chordoma cell lines. Digital spatial profiling of inflamed and non-inflamed chordomas revealed striking differences in both the cancer cell and stromal compartments. Increased immune infiltration was strongly associated with elevated transcriptional activity in cancer cells. MALDI-MSI revealed distinct metabolic signatures and pronounced glycogen accumulation in inflamed chordomas. Nevertheless, IFN-{gamma} stimulation of chordoma cell lines did not induce expression of TBXT (brachyury), the master transcriptional regulator of chordoma biology. Collectively, our findings reveal a strong association between the transcriptomic and metabolic activity in chordomas and their immunogenicity. However, the causal direction of this relationship remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these findings are highly relevant for patient stratification, particularly in the context of immunotherapeutic strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Therapeutic Eradication of Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Inhibits in vivo progression of Pancreatic Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Roos-Mattila, M., Mustonen, H., +7 authors, Seppanen, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal disease with an unmet medical need. therapeutic elimination of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), key drivers of tumor aggressiveness, has been the focus of recent studies. However, the inherent heterogeneity and plasticity of CAFs have hampered the development of CAF-targeted therapies. Clemastine, an FDA-approved cationic amphiphilic drug, is known to elicit cytotoxic lysosomal membrane permeabilization in solid tumors. We evaluated its efficacy in patient derived PDAC organoids and patient avatars. In vitro, half of the organoids responded to clemastine, although sensitivity did not predict in vivo outcomes. In vivo, clemastine treatment led to CAF depletion, halted cancer progression and delayed disease progression. To assess potential synergy with standard-of-care therapy, clemastine was combined with gemcitabine. The combination enabled dual targeting-clemastine effectively eliminated all CAF subtypes, while gemcitabine eradicated cancer cells, leading to inhibition of metastatic dissemination. These findings support clemastine as a promising companion therapy in PDAC, targeting the tumor-supportive microenvironment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TAK1 is a key regulator of oncogenic signaling and differentiation blockade in rhabdomyosarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vuong, A. T., Joshi, A. S., +9 authors, Kumar, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma with a skeletal muscle phenotype, accounting for approximately 50% of all pediatric soft tissue sarcomas and 8% of all childhood cancers. Although RMS cells express myogenic regulatory factors, they fail to undergo terminal differentiation into mature muscle cells. Transforming growth factor {beta}-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a major signaling protein that activates multiple intracellular pathways in response to growth factors, cytokines, and microbial products. Emerging evidence suggests that TAK1 is also an important regulator of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. However, the role and mechanisms of action of TAK1 in RMS remain completely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that TAK1 expression and activity are markedly elevated in a panel of RMS cell lines and in patient tumor specimens. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analyses revealed that TAK1 regulates the expression and activity of many molecules involved in cell cycle control, cell proliferation, and oncogenic signaling. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 suppresses RMS cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, while also promoting terminal myogenic differentiation. TAK1 inhibits differentiation in RMS, at least in part, through up-regulating YAP1 signaling. Our results also demonstrate that inducible knockdown of TAK1 in human RMS xenografts retards tumor growth and enhances myogenic differentiation in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for TAK1 in RMS growth and differentiation, and suggest that TAK1 can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A multimodal whole-slide foundation model for pathology.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tong Ding, Sophia J Wagner, +26 authors, Faisal Mahmood</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning. However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose Transformer-based pathology Image and Text Alignment Network (TITAN), a multimodal whole-slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 whole-slide images via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any fine-tuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that it outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings, including linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval, cross-modal retrieval and pathology report generation.</p>
