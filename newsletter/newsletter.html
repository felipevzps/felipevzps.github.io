<h2 class="paper-title">CryoDDM: CryoEM denoising diffusion model for heterogeneous conformational reconstruction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, F., Chen, Y., +7 authors, Wan, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Heterogeneous protein reconstruction can reveal the relationship between protein dynamics and function, which represents one of the foremost challenges in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis (SPA). However, high-intensity noise results in inaccurate parameter estimation during classification and reconstruction, making it difficult to capture the subtle motions of proteins. Here, we present the Cryo-EM denoising diffusion model (CryoDDM), which denoises images while preserving high-frequency structural information, benefiting conformational heterogeneity classification and reconstruction. The image denoised by CryoDDM can be used to improve downstream analysis, enhance reconstruction resolution, discover new protein conformations, and map out conformational variations. Validated against tree diverse experimental datasets, spanning a proteasome, a membrane protein and a spike protein, our results consistently demonstrate the accuracy and superiority of CryoDDM. By guiding reconstruction with denoised images, CryoDDM enables high-resolution reconstruction of heterogeneous conformations, paving the way to illuminate fundamental questions in structural biology. The CryoDDM project are published at https://github.com/BIT-FuweiLi/CryoDDM.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fast Loading and Transformation of Large-Volume Bioimaging Data Consistently Approaching the I/O Peak Speed</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cai, L., Qu, X., +9 authors, Zeng, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-resolution large-volume biological imaging techniques are now widely used in biological research, but inefficiencies in data processing and visualization persist due to bottlenecks in loading/saving pipelines and limitations of conventional pyramid formats. To address these issues, we have decoupled data loading process into reading from disk and in-memory decompression, while data saving has been separated into in-memory compression and writing to disk. This approach allows us to dedicate more CPU cores to decompression and compression tasks, optimizing resource allocation and maximizing disk I/O throughput. As a result, both loading and saving processes operate near the disk's peak data transfer capacity. Further, we integrated a video stream-inspired format into the pyramid structure, allowing direct access to regions of interest (ROIs) without loading extraneous data into RAM, reducing memory overhead. Compared to the latest methods, our approach improves pyramid data transformation efficiency by at least 6 x and dramatically accelerates downstream tasks like visualization and deep learning inference.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SynPROTAC: synthesizable PROTACs design through synthesis constrained generative model and reinforcement learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, M., Deng, Q., +4 authors, Chen, H., lei, j.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein hydrolysis targeting chimeric (PROTAC) has emerged as a promising technology in degrading disease-related proteins for drug design. Recent deep generative models can accelerate PROTAC design, but the generated molecules are often difficult to synthesize. Here we develop SynPROTAC model, which employs Graphormer encoded warhead or E3 ligand as input, and autoregressively samples reaction templates and building blocks through transformer based decoder for PROTAC construction. The model is also fine-tuned via reinforcement learning for generating PROTACs with favorable binding properties. The comprehensive evaluations indicated that SynPROTAC is capable of generating novel PROTACs with feasible synthetic routes, reasonable physico-chemical and binding related properties.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Global changes in unproductive splicing and the NMD system efficiency in tumors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zavileyskiy, L., Mironov, A. A., Pervouchine, D. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway is a mRNA quality control mechanism, which not only degrades deleterious transcripts but also orchestrates a large number of post-transcriptional regulatory programs through unproductive splicing. Here, we developed a robust metric derived from the quantification of splicing in the RNA-seq data to measure NMD efficiency at a sample level. We demonstrate that NMD efficiency varies substantially both between and within tissues, with the magnitude of variation comparable to that observed upon knockdown of the core NMD factor UPF1. By analyzing TCGA cancer cohorts, we further show that, in many tumors, unproductive splicing events exhibit coordinated changes towards either collective suppression or collective activation of NMD isoforms, which is indicative of a global deregulation of the NMD pathway activity. Consistently, we observed a striking divergence of NMD efficiency in cancers from the tissue-specific baseline level suggesting that tumors partially erase the NMD signature of their tissue of origin. The application of the developed metric to RNA-binding protein knockdowns allowed identification of several novel potential regulators of NMD efficiency. In sum, this study provides a solid framework for NMD efficiency quantification, describes its biological and clinical relevance, and opens new avenues for dissecting mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation by the NMD pathway.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mastodon: the Command Center for Large-Scale Lineage-Tracing Microscopy Datasets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Girstmair, J., Pietzsch, T., +8 authors, Tomancak, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding development in living organisms requires following the divisions, movements, and fates of cells across developing systems. While advances in microscopy have enabled whole-embryo imaging at the cellular level, extracting and analyzing cell lineages from these massive datasets remains a significant computational challenge. We present Mastodon, a scalable, extensible software platform for manual, semi-automated, and automated cell tracking in large images. A purpose-built graph model supports responsive performance for datasets with millions of annotations, making Mastodon a future-proof platform for cell lineage analysis. Built as a Fiji plugin, Mastodon enables interactive visualization, editing, and analysis of complex lineage trees, seamlessly integrated with the raw image data. Comprehension of cell lineages in complex three-dimensional geometries is facilitated by interoperability with the powerful open-source render engine Blender. In three distinct developmental contexts, we demonstrate how Mastodon will accelerate biological insights by providing user-friendly navigation and explorative analysis in complex lineage datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Orthogonal Modes of Gene Expression Evolution Shape Human Neocortical Development and Disease Vulnerability</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sheu, X. D., Yamauchi, Y. Y., Suzuki, I. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The neocortex is responsible for higher-order cognitive abilities such as language, abstract reasoning, and executive function - capacities that are particularly advanced in humans. To elucidate the molecular foundations of neocortical evolution in the human lineage, it is essential to examine how conserved gene repertoires have undergone expression changes relative to other mammals. The expression changes in conserved genes are widely regarded as key drivers of the phenotypic evolution of human-specific traits. In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparative single-cell transcriptomic analysis of fetal neocortical development across four mammalian species: human, macaque, mouse, and ferret. To validate human-specific expression changes, we further analyzed brain organoids derived from both human and chimpanzee stem cells. Genes exhibiting human-specific expression shifts were systematically classified along three orthogonal dimensions: overall expression level (Human Level Distinctive; HLD), temporal expression trend (Human Trend Distinctive; HTD), and differentiation lineage specificity (Human Differentiation trajectory Distinctive; HDD). HLD genes were frequently enriched for long introns and located near Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), and showed pronounced upregulation in humans. These genes were strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay, as well as with megalencephaly and glioblastoma. HTD genes, in contrast, exhibited a unique pattern in humans, peaking early in development and subsequently declining - opposite to the steadily increasing trends observed in other species. These genes were significantly enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal functions, pointing to a temporally restricted elevation in biosynthetic activity in early human corticogenesis. HDD genes displayed a marked shift in lineage-specific expression: cilia-related genes that are typically expressed in apical progenitors in non-human species were instead highly expressed in outer radial glia (oRGs) in humans. This spatial reorganization of ciliary gene activity suggests an oRG-specific adaptation in signaling architecture. Together, these results highlight the diversity of regulatory changes that have shaped human cortical development. Distinct classes of gene expression evolution - mediated in part by HARs - appear to have contributed not only to the expansion and increased complexity of the human neocortex, but also to its heightened vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and oncogenic pathologies. The identified human distinctive genes will be the target of future experimental verification to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms regulating human-specific aspects of cortical development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EpiTox: A Multi-Modular Framework for Population-Aware Off-Target Prediction Highlighting MAGE-A3 Cross-Reactivity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Al-Hasani, H., Ali, M., +9 authors, Schuster, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeting intracellular tumor antigens presented by peptide human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) complexes offers a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for patients with limited treatment options. However, development of pHLA-targeted drugs such as T-cell receptor (TCR) mimic antibodies (TCRm) and TCR-based therapeutics remains challenging due to severe offtumor and off-target toxicities arising from incomplete pHLA off-target profiling. The fatal neurological toxicities observed in the MAGE-A3 TCR-T cell trial, potentially linked to unanticipated cross-reactivity with EPS8L2- and MAGEA12-derived peptides, underscore the urgent need for more comprehensive safety assessment. Current preclinical de-risking methods rely on peptide-centric similarity searches performed in isolation, failing to capture the complex landscape of peptide cross-reactivity and leaving safety gaps unaddressed. To address these limitations, we developed EpiTox, a computational multi-modular platform that systematically identifies and evaluates pHLA off-targets. EpiTox integrates proteome-wide sequence similarity, genetic context, HLA binding profiles, and layered risk assessment to provide a holistic evaluation of potential cross-reactive peptides. Using MAGE-A3 as a model, EpiTox identified known toxic off-targets and predicted novel epitopes. Notably, an anti-MAGE-A3 therapeutic TCRm antibody bound several newly predicted off-targets, including three SNP-derived peptides. By enabling comprehensive and predictive preclinical safety screening, EpiTox supports safer TCRm drug development and may help prevent future clinical failures.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evaluation of the Ultima Genomics UG 100™ sequencing platform for clinical services</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Santuari, L., Kolpakov, I., +2 authors, Howald, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The steep reduction in the cost of genome sequencing started with the introduction of Solexa Sequencing-By-Synthesis technology in 2006 has plateaued recently due to technical limitations in the use of closed flowcells and to the cost of reagents. The Ultima Genomics UG 100 is the first sequencing machine to lower the cost of human genome sequencing to 80$. However, technical limitations in resolving long homopolymer regions undermine the application of this technology to short variant calling in clinical settings. Here, we evaluate the ability of UG 100 to identify short variants in relation to its suitability for clinical accreditation, by comparing it with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Systems platform. We focus specifically on the small variant calling performance in long homopolymer regions, both genome-wide and in relation to a set of medically-relevant genes that are challenging to sequence. Our analysis aims at supporting clinicians in determining whether the UG 100 platform is well-suited for their studies, and to guide clinical sequencing centers in evaluating the adoption of this emerging technology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omics Reveals Metabolic-Inflammatory Drivers of Lung Cancer: An Integrated Mendelian Randomization and Machine Learning Study</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li X, Zhang F, +3 authors, Wang X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract Background: Metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation are implicated in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer; however, the causal relationships and translational potential of these associations remain poorly understood. This study aims to delineate the "metabolic-inflammatory-cancer" axis in order to identify high-confidence therapeutic targets and to develop a clinical prognostic tool. Methods: We employed a comprehensive systems biology framework that integrates univariate and multivariate analyses, bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR), Bayesian colocalization, and multi-omics validation, encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and methylomics. Utilizing extensive datasets from GWAS, TCGA, and CPTAC cohorts, we systematically evaluated 30 metabolic and inflammatory exposures. Subsequently, a machine learning-based LASSO-Cox regression model was developed to translate epigenetic findings into a prognostic risk score. Results: MR analysis revealed smoking initiation (\((OR=1.64--1.86)\)) and Body Mass Index (BMI) as predominant causal risk factors. Exploratory mediation analysis suggested a nominally significant role for C-reactive protein (CRP), which mediates approximately 20.15% of the BMI-driven risk for Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) (nominal \((P CDK11A , a novel cell-cycle regulator, and MFAP2 . Notably, MFAP2 exhibited a dissociation between transcript and protein expression, suggesting complex post-transcriptional regulation within the tumor microenvironment. Clinically, our machine-learning derived DNA methylation risk score achieved a C-index of 0.782 within the training cohort, significantly surpassing traditional TNM staging. Importantly, the prognostic signature was successfully validated for Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) in an independent external cohort (GSE39279, \((n=122)\)), where the continuous risk score was confirmed as a significant prognostic factor by univariate Cox regression (\((\text{HR} = 0.9972, P = 0.0142)\)). Although the association with Overall Survival (OS) was not significant (Log-rank \((P = 0.92)\)), the model demonstrated robust clinical utility for recurrence risk. Conclusions: This study elucidates the causal architecture underlying metabolic-driven lung cancer, highlighting the inflammation-coagulation axis as a pivotal therapeutic target. The developed methylation-based risk score provides a robust, actionable tool for precision recurrence risk stratification, effectively bridging the gap between genomic discoveries and clinical implementation.</p>
