<h2 class="paper-title">Biochemical Upcycling of PET via Glycolysis and Engineered Microbial Consortia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Molpeceres-Garcia, F. J., Garcia-Miro, A., +2 authors, Barriuso, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste remains a major environmental challenge due to its recalcitrance and low economic value. Here, we present an integrated biochemical approach that couples glycolysis with a synthetic microbial consortium to upcycle post-consumer PET (pcPET) into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Glycolysis efficiently depolymerized pcPET into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) in 2 h, circumventing the limitations of in vivo PET degradation. We engineered a two-species microbial consortium composed of Comamonas testosteroni RW31, able to metabolise terephthalic acid, and Pseudomonas putida JM37, able to consume ethylene glycol, each modified for the extracellular secretion of PET- and MHET-hydrolases, employing different plasmid architectures. This division of labour enabled rapid BHET hydrolysis and the subsequent upcycling of the released monomers into PHAs. The combination of the different strains allowed to select C. testosteroni pSEVA354-MHETase and P. putida pSEVA234-PETase as the best consortium, based on growth and PHAs content. Overall, this work proposes a strategy for PET waste depolymerisation and valorisation, highlighting the potential of mixed chemical and biological approaches and the use of non-conventional microbial chassis within engineered consortia.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Stimuli-Expressed Protein Qubits for Quantum Quantification of Heavy Metals in Natural Water</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shan, W., Lv, F., +8 authors, Deng, S.-Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Environmental heavy metal pollution poses a severe threat to ecological security and human health, necessitating the development of highly sensitive, specific, and rapid detection technologies. Traditional fluorescent biosensors are often constrained by high background interference and limited sensitivity, while single-target detection systems struggle to meet the demands of complex environmental monitoring. This study constructs a novel magnetically modulated photonic quantum biosensing system based on the CadC-T7 gene circuit, replacing the traditional fluorescent reporter gene EGFP with the magnetically modulated fluorescent protein MagLOV - a quantum biomaterial. To enhance its magnetic modulation performance, the mutant with the highest lock-in amplitude during the directed evolution (R10, MagLOV 2) was selected; Simultaneously, systematic parameter optimization was conducted to determine the optimal magnetic modulation frequency (0.05 Hz), the heavy metal stimulation duration (the 2-hour group exhibited the most significant intra-group variation), and the bacterial concentration at the onset of the heavy metal stimulation (controlled at OD600 = 1 to prevent fluorescence quenching due to culture turbidity). The system demonstrates excellent multi-analyte detection capabilities for lead chloride, lead nitrate, and cadmium chloride across a concentration range of 10-8 to 10-4 M. Compared to conventional steady-state photometric methods based on EGFP and MagLOV 2, the lock-in analysis of MagLOV 2 achieves detection sensitivities enhanced by 1~2 orders of magnitude, with detection limits as low as 2.4 nM for cadmium chloride, 4.8 nM for lead nitrate, and 9.9 nM for lead chloride. Langmuir isotherm fitting results demonstrate high quantitative accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.950), with particularly outstanding fitting performance for cadmium chloride (R2 = 0.999) and lead nitrate (R2 = 0.995).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic Modular Cyanobacterial Consortium Enables Carbon-Negative Production of Glycerol and Derivatives</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, S., Sun, T., +3 authors, Zhang, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyanobacteria offer a direct route for converting solar energy and CO2 into valuable chemicals, yet the metabolic burden of complex heterologous pathways often limits their productivity and stability. Here, we present a modular co-culture strategy that uses glycerol as an efficient mediator metabolite to link cyanobacterial carbon fixation with downstream bioconversion. We first engineered Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 (Syn2973) for high-level glycerol biosynthesis by optimizing synthase selection, eliminating competing pathways, and improving CO2-supply conditions, achieving a titer of 14.53 g/L. In parallel, we constructed glycerol conversion modules in Syn2973 and Gluconobacter oxydans enabling production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and dihydroxyacetone, with exogenous glycerol yielding up to 30.07 g/L 1,3-PDO. Integrating the two modules resulted in a fully autotrophic co-culture that produced all three target chemicals directly from CO2, including semi-continuous 1,3-PDO production at 6.02 g/L/d, corresponding to a net carbon fixation efficiency of 3.18 kg CO2 eq/kg 1,3-PDO.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Design and synthesis of mirror image fluorescent nucleotide reversible terminator, (L)-3'-O-azidomethyl-dGTP-N3-fluorophore, and (D)-9°N mutant DNA polymerase for mirror image (L)-DNA sequencing by synthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kim, D. H., Huang, B.-S., +7 authors, Lee, J. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Functional DNA molecules such as aptamers, catalytic DNAzymes, and dynamic nanostructures have many promising applications in diagnostics and therapeutics yet suffer from limited utility due to immunogenicity and unwanted interactions with other biomolecules, leading to nuclease degradation and unintended sequence driven binding to native sample DNA. Bio-orthogonal, (L)-form or mirror image DNA overcome these challenges yet suffers from the inability to sequence these molecules in a high-throughput manner, a necessary step in the rapid creation of functional (L)-DNA. Here, we report for the first time, design, synthesis, and functional demonstration of (L)-DNA sequencing by synthesis (SBS) using a fluorescent nucleotide reversible terminator, (L)-3'-O-azidomethyl-dGTP-N3-fluorophore paired with a (D)-9{degrees}N mutant DNA polymerase, both enantiomers (i.e., mirror image) of their natural biologically active forms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ghost in the Machine: Evidence for Non-Random Errors During Direct RNA Nanopore Sequencing Due to Post-Translocated RNA Folding</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Needham, J. M., Johnson, P. Z., Simon, A. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Direct RNA nanopore sequencing allows for the identification of full-length RNAs with a ~10% error rate consisting of mismatches and small deletions. These errors are thought to be randomly distributed and structure-independent since RNA/cDNA duplexes are generated to prevent RNA structure formation prior to sequencing. When analyzing citrus yellow vein associated virus (CY1) reads during infection of Nicotiana benthamiana, viral (+/-)foldback RNAs (i.e., viral plus [+]-strands joined to [-]-strands) showed significantly higher error rates (mismatches and deletions) in the 5' (+)RNA portion with errors that were relatively evenly distributed, while errors in the attached (-)RNA portion were less frequent and unevenly distributed. Non-foldback CY1 (+)RNAs from infected plants also showed an uneven distribution of errors, which correlated with errors in in vitro transcribed CY1 (+)RNA reads in both position and frequency. Hotspot errors in non-foldback CY1 (+)RNA and (-)RNA reads only weakly correlated, and hotspots were frequently located 5' of known structural elements. Since nanopore sequencing is also used to identify RNA modifications, which depend on base-specific sequencing errors, algorithms for RNA modification detection were also examined for bias. We found that multiple programs predicted RNA modifications in in vitro transcribed CY1 RNA at the same positions and with similar confidence levels as with in planta CY1 RNA. These data suggest that direct RNA sequencing contains inherent error biases that may be associated with post-translocation RNA folding and low sequence complexity, and therefore extrapolations based on sequencing error require special consideration.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PHI: Prophage-Host Interaction toolkit for automated prediction and comprehensive profiling of prophages and their hosts via Galaxy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Saraiva, J. P., Borim Correa, F., +4 authors, Chatzinotas, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phages shape microbial communities and hold great promise for biotechnology and medicine, yet their automated discovery and contextual analysis within bacterial host genomes remain fragmented and resource-intensive. Here, we introduce the Prophage-Host Interaction Toolkit (PHI), an end-to-end, modular workflow implemented on the Galaxy platform that unifies prophage detection, host profiling, and interactive reporting. By removing installation barriers and consolidating the outputs of multiple tools, PHI enhances reproducibility and interpretability of phage-host studies. Its modular Galaxy implementation allows non-expert users to customize, update, or extend analyses as new tools emerge. When applied to a mock community with 22 bacterial strains, PHI detected 41 prophages across 14 bacterial hosts, classifying them into high- and medium-quality phage genomes. Host assemblies exhibited &gt; 99 % completeness and &lt; 1 % contamination, while DefenseFinder revealed between 3 and 24 antiviral systems per genome. The integrated CRISPR-spacer analysis and host-prediction modules further delineate phage host ranges and potential cross-infection events. In combination with high-resolution visualizations such as genome ideograms, prophage feature maps, and host-virus network graphs, our approach so facilitates rapid data exploration. PHI thus offers a robust platform for advancing our understanding of phage-host interactions, phage ecology and functionality.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring the potential value of aloe active components in inhibiting non-small cell lung cancer through network pharmacology</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shen, C., Zhu, M., +2 authors, Zhou, S.-F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide, and its management is challenged by profound molecular heterogeneity and inevitable resistance to targeted therapies. Natural products offer a valuable reservoir for anticancer drug discovery, yet the therapeutic potential of Aloe vera a medicinal plant rich in structurally diverse bioactive compounds remains insufficiently characterised in the context of NSCLC. Here, we employed an integrated strategy combining network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction analysis, Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment, molecular docking, and 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively elucidate the multi-target and multi pathway regulatory mechanisms of Aloe vera active constituents against NSCLC. We identified 369 aloe-derived targets and 5519 NSCLC-related genes, with 268 overlapping targets enriched in pathways involving EGFR signalling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, p53 regulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and drug-resistance networks. Core hub genes included TP53, EGFR, AKT1, and STAT3. Molecular docking demonstrated strong spontaneous binding between key aloe compounds (such as aloe-emodin, aloeresin C, quercetin and sitosterols) and wild-type EGFR, mutant EGFR T790M/C797S, AKT1, and p53. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable ligand-protein interactions, favourable hydrogen-bonding networks, and energetically favourable binding free energies. Collectively, our findings reveal a systematic, multi-level regulatory landscape through which Aloe vera may exert anti-NSCLC effects and highlight several candidate molecules with potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy or overcome EGFR-TKI resistance. This study provides a solid theoretical framework for subsequent experimental validation and the development of novel aloe-derived anticancer agents with low toxicity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Image-guided alignment of consecutive multi-modal tissue slides</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Manzato, B., Novella Rausell, C., +7 authors, Mahfouz, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multi-modal spatial data analysis often requires precise physical alignment of consecutive tissue sections, a process that can be challenging and typically relies on shared molecular markers or image recognition techniques. Here, we introduce COAST (Consecutive multi-Omics Alignment of Spatial Tissues), a method to reliably physically align consecutive tissue sections to produce a unified multi-modal molecular dataset suitable for downstream applications. COAST relies exclusively on the images associated with spatial data, eliminating the need for common molecular features or prior annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COAST using spatial transcriptomics slides, where it achieves performance comparable to established uni-modal alignment tools. Applying COAST to spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics/lipidomics tissue sections from a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury allowed the investigation of lipid/metabolite features of transcriptionally-defined cell types. Overall, COAST offers a streamlined and integrative solution for multi-modal spatial data alignment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PPARgene 2.0: leveraging large language models and multi-omics data for enhanced identification and prediction of PPAR target genes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qin, J., Xie, W., +8 authors, Fang, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Upon ligand binding, PPARs activate target gene transcription and regulate a variety of important physiological processes such as lipid metabolism, inflammation, wound healing and immune responses. PPARgene is a database that integrates literature-curated and computationally predicted PPAR target genes. It provides gene-level annotations including tissue specificity, species, and supporting PubMed IDs. Computational predictions are generated using a machine learning method that combines PPRE motif analysis with microarray expression data. Here, we introduce PPARgene 2.0, a 10-year update to the original PPARgene database. This update adds 35 newly reported PPAR target genes, 20 PPAR{beta}/{delta} target genes, and 72 PPAR{gamma} target genes, bringing the total number of curated target genes in the database to 337. To retrieve newly reported PPAR target genes from the literature, we used two language models to screen publications after 2016. Candidate papers were then manually reviewed, and verified target genes were added to the updated database. This update also improved the predictive method by expanding the volume of high-throughput gene expression data and incorporating PPAR-related ChIP-seq datasets alongside in silico PPRE analysis. Fivefold cross-validation demonstrated that the new predictive method outperforms the original one. The updated prediction tool is available as part of the PPARgene 2.0 platform. The database is openly accessible at https://www.ppargene.org.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TIF1{gamma} is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and key mediator of the noncanonical TGF-{beta} signaling pathway. Initially characterized for its developmental functions, TIF1{gamma} is essential for maintaining the pluripotency of adult stem cells, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Although TGF-{beta} signaling contributes to cancer progression and recurrence, TIF1{gamma} has traditionally been regarded as a tumor suppressor due to its inhibition of oncogenes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, clinical reports have associated high TIF1{gamma} expression at advanced cancer stages with poor prognosis. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this paradox, we identify a previously unrecognized role of TIF1{gamma} in promoting the self-renewal capacity of oral cancer cells, thereby contributing to disease recurrence. Phosphoproteomic profiling of self-renewal-enriched cells revealed activation of a noncanonical TGF-{beta} pathway. Using extreme limiting dilution assays, an ALDH1A1-DsRed2 cancer stem cell reporter, multiple oral cancer cell lines, primary 3D cultures on alginate matrix, and orthotopic mouse models, we demonstrate that TIF1{gamma} depletion significantly reduces self-renewal and prolongs disease-free survival. Immunoprecipitation (IP)-LC/MS/MS analysis identified transcriptional regulators within the TIF1{gamma} interactome, including TRRAP and H2A.Z, which were validated by IP and FRET assays. ChIP and IP studies further revealed that during self-renewal enrichment, TRRAP acetylates H2A.Z, decreasing the chromatin occupancy of its unacetylated form. Acetylated H2A.Z is subsequently recognized by TIF1{gamma}, which monoubiquitinates H2B at promoters of self-renewal genes such as HES1, initiating transcription. In alignment with findings from mouse neocortical development, where a Notch-independent Hes1-expressing (NIHes1) population defines primitive quiescent stem cells, we show that TIF1{gamma} acts as an acetylation reader specifically at the NIHES1 promoter region of HES1. TIF1{gamma} depletion drives NIHES1 cells toward a Notch-dependent HES1 (NDHES1) identity. RNA-seq confirmed reversal of 100 NIHES1-specific genes following TIF1{gamma} loss, along with downregulation of pluripotency-associated genes found in embryonic stem cells, supporting a critical role for TIF1{gamma} in maintaining primitive cancer stem cell states. Consistent with our in vivo findings, primary oral cancer samples showed that increased frequencies of TIF1{gamma}+/TRRAP+/H2A.Z- cells strongly predict recurrence. Given that the histone acetylation-reader function of TIF1{gamma} drives poor prognosis, our findings suggest the TIF1{gamma} bromodomain as a potential therapeutic target requiring further investigation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Promoter DNA Methylation Epigenetically Regulates the Tumor-Suppressor Function of the miR-379/656 (C14MC) Cluster in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Karunakara, S. H., Kabekkodu, S. P., +4 authors, Santhekadur, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in HCC development and progression. The role of epigenetic processes like DNA methylation in the regulation of miRNAs is critical to HCC pathogenesis. In this study, we show that the miR-379/656 cluster (C14MC) acts as a tumor suppressor cluster and is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. We demonstrated that C14MC is downregulated in HCC cell lines through nCounter assay and in clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) liver hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. The C14MC promoter was identified and characterized through cloning and dual luciferase assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the loss of C14MC tumor suppressor function is directly regulated by the hypermethylation of promoter-bound CpGs, as shown in artificial methylation experiments. The reactivation of specific C14MC miRNAs, like miR-299-5p and miR-376c-3p via mimics, abrogated the expression of several target oncogenes, including PARP1, SPP1, RAD21, and CENPA that regulate critical molecular pathways such as the p53 signaling and NF-kappa B signaling pathways in HCC. Additionally, overexpression of miR-299-5p and miR-376c-3p inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion, suggesting that overexpression of candidate C14MC miRNAs can mitigate cancer hallmarks in HCC cells. Furthermore, we checked for the clinical correlation of C14MC targets and their target genes in terms of survival outcomes and identified the key genes associated with prognostic potential in HCC. We conclude from our experimental findings that C14MC is a tumor-suppressor miRNA cluster and is regulated epigenetically by methylation in HCC. Several of these miRNAs and their targets can be used for early HCC diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, targeting C14MC can be useful in HCC management.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biologically-informed regional subset analysis with CatBoost for robust tissue-of-origin prediction.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sungmin Yang, Hong-Gee Kim</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate identification of cancer tissue/cell of origin (TOO/COO) is critical for diagnosis and treatment; yet existing whole-genome approaches demand extensive computation and often struggle with sparse mutation signals. Here, we introduce an informative regional subset framework that selects a small number of biologically and statistically significant 1Mbp genomic intervals to train a CatBoost prediction model. On a benchmark of 137 whole-genome samples across six cancer types, our method achieved a 4% gain in melanoma accuracy (from 88.0% using all 2,128 regions to 92.0% with 300 regions), a 4.4% gain in multiple myeloma (87.0% with 600 regions), and perfect (100%) accuracy in high-mutation cancers such as esophageal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma with as few as 50 informative regions. When extended to 934 PCAWG samples spanning 14 cancer lineages, the same limited regional subsets matched or improved whole-genome performance, reaching up to 100% accuracy in gastrointestinal, skin, and brain cancers, demonstrating exceptional scalability. Our approach not only reduces computational burden and enhances interpretability but also provides a robust, generalizable tool for precision oncology and the diagnosis of cancers of unknown primary.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrating multi-omics and machine learning to decipher the role of GSTP1 in endocrine-disrupting chemical-induced prostate cancer pathogenesis.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tongpeng Liu, Yu Yao, +2 authors, Guiming Zhang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis involves complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This study aimed to systematically identify key genes linking EDC exposure to PCa using an integrated bioinformatics and machine learning (ML) approach. We analyzed four transcriptomic datasets (GSE32571, GSE71016, GSE46602, GSE200879) and identified 437 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). By integrating these with high-confidence EDC-interacting genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), we pinpointed 169 core candidates. An ensemble ML framework, evaluating over 70 algorithm combinations, identified an optimal model (glmBoost + RF) that refined this list to eight core genes, including Glutathione S-Transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis established a causal, protective role for GSTP1 against PCa risk (OR = 0.880, 95 % CI = 0.777-0.998, P = 0.046). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed stable binding between GSTP1 and high-priority EDCs, such as Benzo[a]pyrene (binding energy: -9.8 kcal/mol), indicating a direct interaction mechanism. Functional enrichment analyses implicated these genes in oxidative stress response and xenobiotic metabolism. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and immune infiltration analysis suggested a role for GSTP1 in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Our findings elucidate a critical "EDC-GSTP1-PCa" axis, highlighting GSTP1's potential as a therapeutic target and providing mechanistic insights into environmental chemical-induced prostate carcinogenesis.</p>
