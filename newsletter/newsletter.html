<h2 class="paper-title">BiOmics: A Foundational Agent for Grounded and Autonomous Multi-omics Interpretation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cao, L., Li, Y., +14 authors, Fang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While AI has automated bioinformatic workflows, biological interpretation remains fragmented and often disconnected from mechanistic insights. Existing AI is bifurcated between statistical "black-box" models that lack logical grounding and simple agents restricted to shallow knowledge retrieval. To bridge this divide, we introduce BiOmics, a foundational agent that synthesizes multi-omics data with adaptive knowledge for biological interpretation. BiOmics introduces a novel dual-track architecture comprising a harmonized explicit reasoning space for grounded logic and a unified latent embedding space for high-dimensional association mapping. This architecture enables a transformative "Retrieving-Reasoning-Predicting" paradigm for purposeful, cross-scale inference traversing the biological hierarchy, from molecular variants to disease phenotypes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiOmics surpasses state-of-the-art AI agents and specialized algorithms, markedly augmenting the granularity and depth of biological insights. Specifically, BiOmics exhibits unique superiority in uncovering indirect pathogenic variants, achieving reference-free cell annotation, and prioritizing drug repurposing candidates tailored to specific datasets. BiOmics further enriches the interpretive landscape of biological entities, leveraging its reasoning-grounded knowledge graph to uncover deep functional contexts. Ultimately, BiOmics provides a versatile engineering foundation to transition AI for Science from descriptive "data fitting" to autonomous, knowledge-driven interpretation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PersonaAI: An Interactive Agentic-AI Framework for Autonomous Hypothesis Generation and Validation in Aging</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cho, B., Lee, G.-Y., +9 authors, Won, K.-J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Elucidating the mechanisms of aging is impeded by its stochastic, multi-scale nature and cellular heterogeneity, challenges that are compounded by the overwhelming volume of biomedical literature and the complexity of genome-wide datasets. To overcome these barriers, we present PersonaAI, an interactive agentic-AI framework that acts as a digital co-scientist. By integrating literature-based reasoning with autonomous in silico validation, PersonaAI synthesizes over 560,000 aging-related publications via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to propose mechanistic hypotheses. These hypotheses are subsequently validated by autonomous agents utilizing single-cell RNA-seq data. Using a temporal cutoff strategy restricted to pre-2020 literature, we demonstrate that PersonaAI can generate hypotheses effectively validated by post-2021 discoveries, proving its capacity for inference beyond simple information retrieval. In application, the system identified senescent Cirbp+ hepatocytes as a liver-intrinsic aging program and uncovered a middle-aged, male-specific decline in adipose stem and progenitor cells, driven by vascular niche deterioration and disrupted VEGF-VEGFR signaling. These results establish PersonaAI as a scalable platform that augments human intuition with autonomous data-driven validation, providing a generalizable platform for accelerating discovery in aging biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CellFluxV2: An Image Generative Foundation Model for Virtual Cell Modeling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Y., Su, Y., +11 authors, Yeung-Levy, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Building a virtual cell that simulates cellular behavior in silico is a central goal of computational biology. We introduce CellFluxV2, an image-generative model that predicts how cell morphologies change in response to chemical and genetic perturbations. A core innovation of CellFluxV2 is to learn distribution-level transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cells within the same experimental batch using flow matching, enabling it to disentangle true perturbation effects from confounding batch effects. Incorporating three methodological advances, CellFluxV2 achieves up to a 77% improvement in image fidelity over diffusion- and GAN-based baselines, while maintaining biological fidelity comparable to ground-truth images. Scaling up CellFluxV2, we establish the first scaling laws in image-based virtual cell modeling, demonstrating that performance improves consistently with both dataset size and model capacity. Furthermore, the scaled-up model generalizes well to out-of-distribution perturbations and exhibits two novel capabilities: batch-effect correction and cell-state interpolation. Together, these results position CellFluxV2 as a powerful foundation model advancing the vision of a virtual cell, unlocking novel opportunities for in silico drug screening.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Expanding the Genetic Code of an Animal with Two Non-Canonical Amino Acids</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vazquez Rodriguez, J. J., Greiss, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Expanding the genetic code of multicellular organisms for the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids has thus far been limited to a single non-canonical amino acid at a time. To overcome this limitation, we establish the pyrrolysyl-tRNA-synthetase (PylRS)/tRNAPyl pair from Methanomethylophilus alvus in Caenorhabditis elegans and show that it is highly efficient and mutually orthogonal to the Methanosarcina mazei PylRS/tRNAPyl pair previously established in the worm. We furthermore establish a set of mutually orthogonal blank codons for use in C. elegans that allow the simultaneous and independent incorporation of two ncAAs for the first time in an animal. We then engineer the non-canonical amino acid specificity of M. alvus PylRS to incorporate several photocaged ncAAs. Taken together, this allows expression of photocaged variants of FLP and Cre using two different photocaged amino acids, enabling us to optically control the expression of two target genes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Benchmarking Next-Generation Sequencing Platforms: A Comprehensive Comparison Of Single-Cell RNA-Seq from Ultima UG 100 vs. Illumina NovaSeq X Plus</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xiong, R., Patel, J., +7 authors, Javidi, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an essential technology for dissecting cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, with Illumina platforms serving as the dominant NGS provider. The recent emergence of the Ultima Genomics UG 100 platform offers a high-throughput and potentially more cost-effective alternative, warranting a rigorous comparative analysis. Here, we conducted a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of the Ultima Genomics UG 100 and Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platforms, generating deep-coverage scRNA-seq data from human PBMCs and stimulated T-cell samples. Our multi-level analysis revealed highly concordant performance in both cell type identification and gene expression. We found that both platforms robustly captured all major immune lineages and demonstrated good transcriptional agreement. Minor observed discrepancies were primarily correlated with low UMI counts, suggesting stochastic biological effects rather than technical variance. Overall, our study establishes that the Ultima UG 100 delivers performance highly comparable to the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus for single-cell transcriptomics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Medea: An omics AI agent for therapeutic discovery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sui, P., Li, M., +6 authors, Zitnik, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> AI agents promise to empower biomedical discovery, but realizing this promise requires the ability to complete transparent, long-horizon analyses using tools. Agents must make intermediate decisions explicit, and validate each decision and output against data and tool constraints as the analysis unfolds. We present Medea, an AI agent that takes an omics objective and executes a transparent multi-step analysis using tools. Medea comprises four modules: research planning with context and integrity verification, code execution with pre- and post-run checks, literature reasoning with evidence-strength assessment, and a consensus stage that reconciles evidence across datasets, tools, and literature. Medea uses 20 tools spanning single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets, cancer vulnerability maps, pathway knowledge bases, and machine learning models. We evaluate Medea across 5,679 analyses in three open-ended domains: target identification across five diseases and cell type contexts (2,400 analyses), synthetic lethality reasoning in seven cell lines (2,385 analyses), and immunotherapy response prediction in bladder cancer (894 patient analyses). In evaluations that vary large language models, tool sets, omics objectives, and agentic modules, Medea improves the performance of existing approaches by up to 46% for target identification, 22% for synthetic lethality, and 24% for immunotherapy response prediction, while maintaining low failure rates and calibrated abstention. Medea shows that verification-aware AI agents improve performance by producing transparent analyses, not simply more efficient workflows.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">eTRex Reveals Oncogenic Transcriptional Regulatory Programs Across Human Cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, Z., Yang, Y., +3 authors, Wang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcriptional regulators (TRs) are essential proteins that regulate gene transcription, and their dysregulation defines the oncogenic transcriptional regulatory programs that drive tumor-specific gene expression. Existing pan-cancer resources summarize these programs by aggregating signals across individual datasets, neglecting the context-specific features that capture the diversity of transcriptional regulation underlying cancer heterogeneity. By developing a variational Bayesian hierarchical model named eTRex (epigenomics-based Transcriptional Regulator explorer) and applying it to 4,819 cancer-related ATAC-seq datasets, we provide a comprehensive pan-cancer atlas of functional TR profiles that preserve the context-specific features of each dataset. This study reveals both common regulators across diverse malignancies and those with highly specific roles. We extensively validated these findings using independent CRISPR/Cas9 screening, mutation, and transcriptomic datasets. Collectively, this pan-cancer atlas of functional TR profiles represents a comprehensive, biologically interpretable resource for uncovering transcriptional regulatory programs, identifying biomarkers, prioritizing therapeutic targets in oncology, and is freely accessible through an interactive web portal.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dynamics-aware Evolutionary Profiling Uncouples Structural Rigidity from Functional Motion to Enable Enhanced Variant Interpretation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Karagöl, T., Karagöl, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolutionary conservation is a powerful part of mutational intolerance prediction, yet traditional pathogenicity metrics frequently conflate two distinct biophysical constraints: structural stability (rigidity) and functional mechanics (dynamics). We introduce Dynamics-Aware Evolutionary Profiling to resolve this ambiguity, integrating Molecular Dynamics with evolutionary conservation and coupling analysis across human/cross-species-proteome of 151 protein structures. By mathematically uncoupling biophysical forces, we define orthogonal metrics; the Rigid Conserved Score (RCS) for the structural scaffold, and the Dynamic Conserved Score (DCS) for flexible residues. Our analysis reveals a fundamental bifurcation in pathogenicity. RCS serves as a filter for lethal structural failure, isolating hydrophobic core residues whose mutation triggers unfolding. In contrast, DCS identified a rare population of residues that are evolutionarily highly-conserved but structurally mobile; these Dynamic-Conserved sites exhibit intermediate pathogenicity and are enriched in flexible hinge residues (Gly, Pro). Validation against 737 human variants from ClinVar demonstrates that DCS captures a distinct pathogenic mechanism regarding essential protein motion. Notably, DCS and RCS correctly flagged some pathogenic variants of NARS1 and PGK1 that were misclassified as benign or ambiguous by AlphaMissense. These results indicate that while the rigid core represents a stability bottleneck, DCS isolates functional sites likely driving allosteric regulation. We provide an open-access web interface (ADEPT) for these metrics. By isolating dynamic-conserved residues, this framework refines the interpretation of Variants of Uncertain Significance in dynamic regions and reveals tunable targets for rational drug design, moving beyond the static optimization of the folded state.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TET2 and TP53 Mutations Cooperatively Modulate the Response to Inflammation to Promote Leukemic Transformation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vela, P. S., Kelly, B., +9 authors, Shih, A. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TET2 is a commonly mutated gene in hematologic malignancies, including as an initiating event in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Its mutation alters hematopoietic self-renewal, differentiation, and systemic inflammation responses. TP53 mutations co-occur with TET2 mutations and are also observed in patients with high-risk clonal hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies. Using a murine model, we found that HSPCs with both mutations initially promoted a myeloproliferative phenotype. Over time these double mutant HSPCs acquire additional genomic alternations, leading to disease progression to acute leukemias including B-ALL. We observed enhanced inflammatory signatures at transformation and identified NLRP1 as a target of TP53 activation. Decreased response to an inflammatory cell death pathway in the setting of TP53 mutation allows cells to tolerate inflammatory stress. This pathway also modifies response to chemotherapies that induce protein translational stalling. Our results identify a hematopoietic stem cell stress response pathway with implications on adaptation to inflammation and chemotherapy tolerance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tumor microenvironment signature associated with morphology in systemic ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bessiere, C., Babin, L., +4 authors, Lamant, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are heterogeneous entities whose tumoral microenvironment (TME) may influence disease phenotype and outcome. To dissect their immune and stromal composition, we used two complementary algorithms, CIBERSORTx and MCP-counter, on Affymetrix data from 255 patients whole-tissue biopsies, including 78 systemic anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Clustering based on inferred cell proportions revealed a clear separation between ALCL and other PTCL subtypes, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). ALCL-enriched clusters were characterised by granulocytes and macrophages lineages, mast cells, NK cells, memory CD4+ T-cells, as well as fibroblast and endothelial signatures, whereas as expected, AITL cluster was enriched for T-follicular helper cells, B-cells and macrophages. Finally, we focused on 66 ALCL cases with relapse risk and morphological subtype clinical annotations. Distinct TME features enriched in M1 macrophages and monocytes were associated with adverse outcomes and non-common morphological variants. Transcriptomic analyses of mononuclear phagocytes across Affymetrix and RNAseq datasets confirmed distinct clustering according to cell morphology. These analyses identified potential biomarkers associated with uncommon variants and absent from ALK+ ALCL cell lines, confirming their TME origin. Macrophage- and monocyte-related signatures emerged as key contributors in ALK+ ALCL patients heterogeneity, linking TME patterns to tumor morphology and prognosis. These signatures may serve as biomarkers for patient risk stratification and guide the development of targeted therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning prediction for AML based on 3D genome selected circRNA.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhangli Yuan, Wenqian Yan, +14 authors, Yi Shi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically aggressive hematologic malignancy driven by complex genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), characterized by covalently closed structures and exceptional stability, have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers. However, existing circRNA-based predictive models largely depend on differential expression, overlooking the potential impact of higher-order chromatin organization on circRNA formation and function. Here, we propose a machine learning framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture to refine circRNA selection for AML prediction. By mapping 9,565 circRNAs onto a 3D chromatin model reconstructed from Hi-C data, we analyzed their spatial clustering and biological pathway enrichment. Eighteen pathways exhibited significant 3D aggregation of circRNAs, enabling radial stratification based on nuclear localization. Five circRNA panels were designed using complementary strategies combining expression, pathway, and spatial features. Cross-validation and external validation across six machine learning algorithms showed that the panel derived from the fifth radial layer (Panel-3DG-Radius5) achieved the most robust and consistent performance (ROC-AUC &gt; 0.99). Integrating 3D genomic context reduced feature collinearity while enhancing biological interpretability. Overall, our study establishes a 3D genome-informed paradigm for circRNA biomarker discovery, demonstrating that spatial genome organization can substantially improve the precision and robustness of AML predictive modeling.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering osteoclast resorption units <i>via</i> sacrificial microgels in a bone-on-chip platform.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Conceição F, Araújo-Gomes N, +3 authors, Moreira Teixeira L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bone remodeling is a tightly regulated process essential for skeletal health, occurring within specialized structures known as bone multicellular units (BMUs). Despite extensive research, current animal models and conventional in vitro systems fail to reproduce the spatial and cellular complexity of human BMUs. Moreover, the mineralized nature of bone tissue poses imaging challenges due to its inherent opacity, limiting the ability to monitor osteoclast activity in complex 3D models. Control over the structure of in vitro BMU micro-confined niches would enable more effective 3D analysis readouts of osteoclast activity. Herein we developed a BMU-inspired bone-on-chip platform that enables localized, non-invasive analysis of human osteoclast function. Using microfluidic droplet generation, we encapsulated mature osteoclasts in monodisperse, enzymatically degradable dextran-tyramine (Dex-TA) microgels with defined size. These osteoclast-laden microgels were embedded within mineralized collagen hydrogels and selectively degraded to form confined, cell-populated microstructures directly on-chip. In addition, the contrast between the microcavities and surrounding mineralized matrix allowed non-destructive monitoring of matrix degradation using reflection confocal microscopy. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the morphological and functional differentiation of osteoclasts within the platform. Furthermore, our results demonstrated increased matrix resorption in response to RANKL treatment, validating the system's capacity to assess osteoclast activity under relevant stimuli. This bone-on-chip model overcomes key limitations of traditional systems by enabling spatial confinement, controlled degradation, and functional readouts of osteoclast behavior in a human-relevant 3D microenvironment. It is thus a versatile tool for studying bone remodeling and has strong potential for application in disease modeling and drug screening for bone-related disorders.</p>
