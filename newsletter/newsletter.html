<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic RNA-protein decoy granules to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Willinger, O., Granik, N., +2 authors, Amit, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic receptor decoys offer a promising strategy to block viral entry but are often limited by instability and rapid clearance. Here we introduce AntiCoV decoy particles: phase-separated synthetic RNA-protein nanoparticles that display multivalent human ACE2 and act as robust decoy receptors for SARS-CoV-2. The granules remain structurally stable for at least two weeks at room temperature. Using confocal imaging and FRET, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain is absorbed into the granule matrix with nanometer-scale proximity to ACE2. In viral entry assays with Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants, AntiCoV decoy particles achieve complete inhibition of infection at low micromolar concentrations and outperform soluble ACE2, which also exhibits infection enhancement at low doses. A minimal kinetic model suggests a multistep spike-priming mechanism that reconciles this biphasic response. AntiCoV decoy particles therefore provide a stable, modular, and pan-variant antiviral platform with potential for low-cost, room-temperature-stable prophylaxis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">High-PepBinder: A pLM-Guided Latent Diffusion Framework for Affinity-Aware Target-Specific Peptide Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qingyi, M., Zhai, S., +6 authors, Duan, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Peptides, as therapeutic molecules, offer unique advantages in targeting complex protein surfaces, yet their rational design remains limited by the vastness of the sequence space and the constraints of traditional approaches. Here, we propose High-PepBinder, a sequence-only conditional diffusion framework for target-specific peptide generation. Guided by the target protein sequence, High-PepBinder adopts a dual encoder architecture that integrates protein language models (pLMs) with the diffusion model. This approach cascades the peptide generation model with an affinity classifier and enables the generation process to capture affinity-related features of the peptides through lightweight joint optimization. Due to the scarcity of protein-peptide affinity data, we constructed PepPBA, to our knowledge the most comprehensive dataset to date, and established a structure- and physics-based screening pipeline to prioritize top candidates. Results show that High-PepBinder demonstrates competitive performance across multiple peptide generation and affinity-related tasks. For representative targets, including KEAP1, XIAP, and EGFR, the generated peptides preserve key binding geometries and interface patterns of reference peptides in predicted complexes, while maintaining sequence diversity and favorable predicted properties. Overall, High-PepBinder contributes toward a general and sequence-only strategy for peptide design, offering a computational framework for expanding peptide discovery against challenging targets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">dgiLIT: A Method for Prioritization and AI Curation of Drug-Gene Interactions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cannon, M. J., Bratulin, A., +9 authors, Wagner, A. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> IMPORTANCE: The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) has a long history of driving hypothesis generation for biomedical research through the careful curation of drug-gene interaction data from primary and secondary sources with supporting literature. Recent advances in large-language model (LLM) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled new paradigms for knowledge extraction and biocuration. The accelerating growth of biomedical literature presents a significant challenge for maintaining up-to-date interaction data. With more than 38 million citations indexed in PubMed alone, new strategies must evolve to identify and incorporate new interaction data into DGIdb. OBJECTIVE: Identify new cost-effective AI curation strategies for incorporating new drug-gene interactions into DGIdb. METHODS: We present a methodology that leverages deterministic natural language processing techniques, existing harmonization frameworks, and AI-assisted curation to systematically narrow the literature space and identify new drug-gene interactions from published studies for inclusion in DGIdb. RESULTS: We demonstrate the use of lemmatization to prioritize a set of 100 abstracts containing high amounts of interaction words for downstream AI curation. From our set of abstracts, we were then able to identify 137 drug-gene interactions via an AI curation task, with 121 (88.3%) of these interactions being completely novel to DGIdb. A human expert evaluator reviewed this interaction set and was able to validate 134 of 137 (97.8%) interactions as being valid based on the text provided. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results highlight a promising, cost-effective method of ingesting new interactions into DGIdb.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hyperactivated YAP1 Drives an Invasive EMT Subtype of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, J., Lv, X., +15 authors, Wang, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cervical cancer (CVC) is classically understood as an HPV-driven disease in which high-risk HPV infects cervical basal epithelial cells, induces neoplastic transformation, and drives upward epithelial expansion, pathogenic events underlying the success of cytology- and HPV-based screening. With widespread HPV vaccination and screening, the WHO has launched the CVC elimination initiative and believes that CVC will be the first cancer that would be eliminated as a public health problem. However, statistics showed that CVC remains the most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide, and in the United States, where HPV testing and Pap smears have reached near-maximal implementation, the CVC mortality rate has plateaued for more than two decades. These epidemiologic trends suggest the existence of a subset of CVC that can escape current screening strategies. Here, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of YAP1 caused by disruption of Hippo-YAP signaling is sufficient to induce a subtype of HPV-independent invasive CVC that lacks surface lesions and therefore evades HPV- and cytology-based detection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing combined with high-resolution spatial transcriptomics, we define the cellular architecture, molecular pathways, and immune microenvironment underlying this invasive subtype. We show that YAP1-driven tumors adopt an EMT-high transcriptional state and selectively recruit immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells that functionally interact with cancer cells to promote invasion and progression. Our findings suggest that targeting the disrupted Hippo signaling may offer a new strategy to prevent the subset of invasive CVC that current HPV- and Pap-based programs cannot detect, an essential step toward achieving global CVC elimination.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RNAseq analysis reveals the recurrent loss of heterozygosity in lung cancer and associated transcription patterns</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gumerov, R., He, W., +3 authors, SCHWAGER, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A key limitation in cancer transcriptomics is the lack of accompanying genomic profiling such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or copy number alteration (CNA) data. Here we address this by showing that RNA-seq alone can be used to infer chromosomal aberrations and identify biologically meaningful patterns in lung cancer. Through a large-scale meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-seq datasets from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and matched controls, we reconstructed large scale CNA profiles and identified deletions in 3p, 9p, and 17p as the most frequent genomic events. Validation against paired WGS data confirmed a high degree of accuracy for RNA-seq-based inference. Our analyses revealed that while deletion-associated transcriptional heterogeneity exists, approximately 25% of differentially expressed genes were shared across all three deletion classes, indicating a conserved oncogenic program in lung cancer. Enrichment analysis linked these shared genes to pathways governing cell division, DNA replication, and extracellular matrix organization, while deletion-specific effects reflected disruption of tumor suppressor pathways, notably p53 signaling in 17p-deleted tumors, leading to deregulation of NOS2 and PLOD2. Integrating gene-level expression data, we identified both shared and deletion-specific biomarkers: TPX2 was consistently overexpressed across all deletion groups, while PTPRZ1 and CLDN9 were uniquely associated with del3p and del9p, respectively. Experimental validation in lung cancer cell lines confirmed these predictions, particularly the upregulation of CLDN9 in del9p carriers. By demonstrating that RNA-seq data can capture large-scale chromosomal events and reveal their transcriptional consequences, this study establishes an efficient framework for genomic inference and biomarker discovery, introducing CLDN9 as a novel, deletion-specific marker with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for 9p-deleted lung cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Organelle proteomics reveals novel metabolic vulnerabilities in FLT3-ITD cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bica, V., Pacile, A. F., +9 authors, Sacco, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the insertion site of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) within the FLT3 gene critically determines the sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Despite recent advances, patients harboring ITDs in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) still lack effective therapeutic options. To elucidate the molecular basis underlying the differential TKI sensitivity of FLT3 ITD cells, we integrated high-resolution mass spectrometry based (phospho)proteomics with subcellular fractionation. Our analysis revealed that midostaurin induces the subcellular redistribution of approximately 2500 proteins involved in crucial biological processes, including cell cycle control, autophagy, and metabolism. Functional analyses further demonstrated that the ITD insertion site determines the autophagy response to midostaurin and modulates mitochondrial metabolism, influencing organelle architecture and ATP production, even at steady state. Importantly, by integrating subcellular proteomic dataset with functional metabolic assays, we uncovered a lipid-dependent vulnerability of FLT3 ITD cells: lipid restriction enhances FLT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane, and markedly reduces cell viability, restoring midostaurin sensitivity of resistant FLT3 ITD cells. Together, our findings reveal that the FLT3 ITD insertion site orchestrates a coordinated remodeling of subcellular protein organization, autophagy, and metabolism, and identify lipid-mediated control of FLT3 compartmentalization as a therapeutically actionable mechanism to overcome TKI resistance in FLT3 ITD AML.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cytoplasmic FKBP7 reflux controls NFE2L1 levels as an adaptive response to chemotherapy in prostate cancer cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">DRENO, L., OUSALEM, F., +11 authors, CHAUCHEREAU, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how cancer cells adapt to chemotherapy is essential for overcoming resistance. One mechanism involved in taxane resistance in prostate cancer is mediated by FKBP7, a still-understudied endoplasmic reticulum-resident cis-trans isomerase. Using cell fractionation, we demonstrate that the ERAD-independent retrotranslocation of FKBP7 into the cytosol correlates with the oxidative stress triggered by chemotherapy, as an escape response. Once in the cytosol, FKBP7 interacts with the translation machinery and with eIF4G1, specifically with its C-terminal HEAT3 domain. Following FKBP7 silencing, polysome profiling and RNA sequencing identified the transcription factor NFE2L1 - a key regulator of oxidative stress adaptation - as an effector of FKBP7. Here, we also produced the first NMR spectra of the FKBP7 catalytic domain, revealing a well-folded protein that binds to rapamycin and everolimus but not to FK506. Overall, our results demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress triggers an adaptive mechanism in which FKBP7 is translocated into the cytosol where it modulates NFE2L1, thereby enabling the survival of resistant cells. These findings lead us to propose the targeting of FKBP7/NFE2L1 signaling as a strategy to overcome adaptive resistance.</p>
