<h2 class="paper-title">Analyzing long-read CRISPR experiments with CRISPRLungo</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hwang, G.-h., Vyshedskiy, B., +4 authors, Bauer, D. E., pinello, l.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long-read sequencing can characterize complex genome editing-induced DNA sequence changes such as large deletions, insertions, and inversions that are difficult to detect using short-read sequencing. However, PCR amplification and sequencing errors complicate accurate variant detection, and existing analysis tools are not optimized for gene editing specific allelic outcomes. Here we present CRISPRLungo, a computational pipeline specifically designed for long-read amplicon sequencing of gene edited samples. CRISPRLungo incorporates unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based error correction and statistical filtering to distinguish true editing events from background noise, enabling robust detection of small indels and structural variants. Through systematic benchmarking using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that CRISPRLungo outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and read recovery. CRISPRLungo supports both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio platforms and identify previously undetected structural variant edits such as inversions in published CRISPR datasets. To demonstrate allele-specific edit quantification, we applied CRISPRLungo to analyze edited primary cells from a patient with harboring compound heterozygous SBDS mutations, accurately quantifying SBDS editing outcomes despite contaminating reads from the homologous SBDSP1 pseudogene. To maximize accessibility, we developed a fully client-side web application requiring no installation, making advanced long-read analysis accessible to researchers regardless of computational expertise. CRISPRLungo is freely available at https://github.com/pinellolab/CRISPRLungo with a user-friendly web interface available at https://pinellolab.github.io/CRISPRLungo.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning guided engineering of conditional split inteins for regulated protein splicing in mammalian cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Di Ventura, B., Liang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inteins are proteins that excise themselves from precursor proteins and connect the flanking polypeptides with a peptide bond. Split inteins consist of two independently translated fragments that must associate to become splice competent. They can be used for diverse posttranslational protein modifications. Using the ML Int∈ algorithm, we predicted unnatural split sites in two of the fastest and most efficient split inteins, gp41-1 and NrdJ-1, to generate functional variants with fragments of reduced mutual affinity. We harness this feature to create conditional versions of these inteins by controlling the physical proximity of the intein fragments with a light-inducible heterodimerization system. The resulting light-activatable gp41-1 and NrdJ-1 inteins enabled blue light dependent control of Cre recombinase activity in mammalian cells, which we exploited to spatially control apoptosis via localized expression of truncated BID (tBID) and caspase-8. This work highlights the versatility of Int∈ for designing conditional inteins for precise spatiotemporal protein regulation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Vesicle-templated self-assembly of freestanding multi-μm DNA shells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, H. Y., Karfusehr, C., Simmel, F. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the quest to create increasingly complex synthetic cell-mimicking systems, a wide range of DNA nanostructures have been developed to coat, permeabilize, sculpt, or otherwise functionalize lipid vesicles. In a complementary strategy, DNA architectures have been used as scaffolds to direct the growth of lipid membrane vesicles. However, no systematic attempts have yet been made to invert this strategy and use lipid vesicles as scaffolds for extended DNA super-assemblies, thereby realizing freestanding, membrane-mimicking DNA shells. Here we introduce a simple and broadly applicable method to implement this concept: DNA shells are first assembled on giant unilamellar vesicles and then liberated by surfactant-mediated liposome removal. We demonstrate the approach with two distinct classes of DNA tectons: a complex barrel-shaped DNA origami with programmable inter-subunit interactions, and a simple nanostar-inspired motif composed of only eleven oligonucleotides. The success of both strategies underscores the generality of our approach and the feasibility of creating shell-like compartments from different DNA architectures. This method enables the construction of tunable, DNA-only containers spanning the size range of eukaryotic cells, offering a fundamentally new type of compartmentalization for bottom-up synthetic biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Automatic Classification of Circulating Blood Cell Clusters based on Multi-channel Flow Cytometry Imaging</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ma, S., Sengupta, S., +7 authors, Li, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters, revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT). Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rapid De Novo Antibody Design with GeoFlow-V3</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Team, B., Tang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent years have witnessed striking advances in miniprotein design, yet de novo antibody discovery remains challenging, marked by low binding rates and the need for extensive, labor-intensive experimental screening of millions of candidates. This technical report introduces GeoFlow-V3, a unified atomic generative model for structure prediction and protein design. GeoFlow-V3 delivers improved accuracy on antibody-antigen complex structure prediction relative to our previous version, and its performance is further enhanced when experimental constraints or prior knowledge are provided, enabling precise control over both folding and design. The model also demonstrates reliable ability to discriminate binders from non-binders based on its confidence scores. Leveraging this capability, we build a GeoFlow-V3 in silico pipeline to design no more than 50 nanobodies per therapeutically relevant target de novo, completing a single round of wet-lab characterization in under three weeks. GeoFlow-V3 identifies at least one binder for 8 tested epitopes and achieves an average hit rate of 15.5%, representing a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over prior computational pipelines. These results position GeoFlow-V3 as an appealing platform for rapid, AI-driven therapeutic antibody discovery, significantly reducing experimental screening demands and offering a powerful avenue to tackle previously undruggable targets. A demo of GeoFlow-V3 can be accessed via prot.design for non-commercial use.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">StoPred: Accurate Stoichiometry Prediction for ProteinComplexes Using Protein Language Models and GraphAttention</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Q., Peng, C., +2 authors, Freddolino, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins often function as part of complexes, and the specific stoichiometry of these assemblies is critical for their biological roles, but experimental determination of assembly composition remains challenging and existing computational methods for stoichiometry prediction are limited. Existing approaches rely on template-based searches or require predefined stoichiometry for structure prediction, hampering their applicability to proteins without close homologs or known assembly states. Recent advances using protein language models (pLM) have enabled sequence-based prediction of homo-oligomer stoichiometry, but these methods are not applicable to hetero-oligomeric complexes and do not fully leverage inter-subunit relationships. Here, we present StoPred, a method that predicts the stoichiometry of protein complexes by integrating pLM embeddings with a graph attention network to model subunit-level interactions. StoPred infers stoichiometry directly from sequence or structure features for both homo- and hetero-oligomers, without requiring template assemblies or predefined composition. We benchmark StoPred against deep learning-based and template-based methods, and show that it achieves improved accuracy and efficiency across curated and blind datasets, with up to 16% and 41% higher top-1 accuracy for homomeric and heteromeric complexes, respectively, compared to the strongest prior method on our held-out test dataset. More importantly, StoPred is the first deep learning-based method capable of accurately predicting the stoichiometry of hetero-oligomeric complexes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Gene library deep sequencing for protein super-family profiling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">T Sabapathy, R., Henry-Cocks, K., +3 authors, Janovjak, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unravelling protein function at scale remains challenging. Gain-of-function (GOF) screens harnessing large open reading frame (ORF) libraries enable systematic functional annotations of cell behavior drivers and drug targets. Currently, few sequencing methods are established to analyze existing ORF libraries and facilitate future library generation. Here, we developed a barcode-free deep sequencing method termed pooled plasmid library sequencing (PPLseq). PPLseq achieved high efficiency and single nucleotide accuracy, including the detection of previously undocumented variants, on a prototypical super-family ORF library (&gt;300 human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)). We next combined PPLseq with high-throughput gene engineering to generate a new library of 246 GPCR-fluorescent protein (FP) fusions. We quantified expression of all members of this library and identified robustly expressed yet understudied receptors. Collectively, we demonstrate accessible, scalable, and sensitive ORF library sequencing towards a deeper understanding of proteome function.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparative genomics of the lipid droplet-associated protein Seipin across eukaryotic diversity illuminates an ancient origin and conserved structural diversity.</h2>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous across living organisms. Characterised in eukaryotes by their lipid monolayer and essential for lipid storage and metabolism in animals, plants, and yeast, little is known about the evolutionary diversity of extant LDs across the eukaryotic tree of life. LDs facilitate an impressive variety of cellular functions outside of just lipid storage; in Metazoa, these include stress responses, cellular signaling, and membrane remodeling. Likewise, the distribution of these functions across eukaryotic diversity is unknown. We have examined the evolutionary trajectory of seipin, a protein associated with LD biogenesis, across eukaryotic diversity. We have identified a pan-eukaryotic distribution of seipin, with an evolutionary pattern that indicates presence in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. Ancient conservation of multiple variants of seipin suggests that seipin may multiple conserved functional roles within the cell. Finally, we identify a lack of sequence homology between BSCL2/seipin in Homo sapiens and the sei-1 gene previously identified as a functional homologue of BSCL2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Though our results suggest that sei-1 may be a highly divergent homologue of BSCL2 / seipin rather than an unrelated protein, the divergence suggests that researchers may need to be cautious applying results obtained in Saccharomyces spp..</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Aharony Tevet, Y., Ravid, O., +8 authors, Jacoby, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells can eliminate leukemia and lymphoma within the central nervous system (CNS). Following a case with CD19+ relapse in the CNS in the presence of persisting Tisagenlecleucel, we generated several models to study CAR T-cells in the CNS. In both immunocompetent and humanized leukemia-bearing mice, CNS-residing CAR T-cells were shown to have inferior ex-vivo killing capacities compared to CAR T-cells harvested from the spleen or bone marrow of receptive mice. In a mechanistic work-up, we identified two contributing factors: First, CAR T-cells cultured in cerebrospinal fluid showed impaired cytotoxic and proliferative function compared to those in serum or other media. Second, using a unique in vitro human blood-brain barrier (BBB) model composed of endothelial cells and brain pericytes, we demonstrated that CAR T-cells that crossed the BBB exhibited antigen-independent activation and diminished cytolytic capacity. This led to increased activation-induced cell death of the BBB-migrating CAR T-cells and was confirmed to be independent of the CAR target and the costimulatory domain. Our findings add possible mechanisms of CAR T-cell resistance in the CNS, relevant for CNS hematologic and non-hematologic tumors.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Diaz-Carballo, D., Noa Bolano, A., +18 authors, Strumberg, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence correlates anatomically with a shared gradient of lymphoid follicles and previously defined neuroendocrine cells. We now define the cellular basis for this observation by identifying a resident cell in the colonic crypts, the Neuro-Immune Crypt-Associated (NICA) cell, characterized by a unique triple phenotype: neuronal (ChgA, TH, peripherin, somatostatin, NSE), robust stemness markers (LGR5, CD133, Glut3, ASCL2, {beta}-catenin), and a diverse array of innate immune molecules (TLR4, CD80, SDF-1). These markers (excluding ChgA) are retained in malignant CRC sections, demonstrating lineage persistence. Functioning as a pathogen gateway, NICA cells express viral entry receptors and the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1, rendering them susceptible to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and subsequent immune cell recruitment. Crucially, we define a novel oncogenic intermediate: the BLEICS (B-Lymphocyte, EBV-Infected, Calamari-Shaped) cell, which exhibits a B cell-myeloid hybrid signature and high CXCR4. The fusion between BLEICS and crypt cells, facilitated by fusogenic Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) envelope proteins, generates the malignant, hybrid CRC lineage. Furthermore, BLEICS cells actively engage cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) via the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis to drive stromal expansion and crypt enlargement. In the resulting CRC cells, the overexpression of the transcription factor REST actively suppresses the neuronal identity (e.g., TH, ChgA), thereby maintaining the proliferative stemness phenotype (LGR5). The specific loss of ChgA in CRC is attributable to REST activity. We show that REST ablation restores ChgA expression and reinstates neuronal differentiation and induces growth arrest, an effect mirrored by pharmacological REST inhibition using valproic acid. This study establishes a new pathogenesis model where the increasing density of lymphoid follicles and NICA precursor cells toward the rectum creates an ideal niche for viral-driven, immune-cell fusion, providing mechanistic targets for REST-driven differentiation therapy and EBV vaccination strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Stromal subsets modulate T-cell infiltration in early breast cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, J., Zhang, H., +8 authors, Swarbrick, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent studies of the tumour microenvironment have elucidated the heterogeneity of stromal cells, with increasing evidence suggesting that stromal subsets play an important role in regulating anti-tumour immunity in breast cancer. However, the functional diversity of these cells within the tumour immune microenvironment and how they interact with immune cells in a spatial and clinical context remain poorly understood. We performed multiplex immunofluorescence on tumour microarrays from two cohorts consisting of 591 breast cancer patients to assess the abundance and spatial co-localisation of stromal and immune subsets and their correlation with clinicopathological features and patient outcomes. We found that stromal subsets are spatially distinct. We found that stromal cells were spatially distinct. A perivascular-like subset that was disseminated throughout the stroma rather than restricted to vessel-adjacent regions was enriched in an immune cold environment and associated with T-cell exclusion. Enrichment for PVLs was prognostic of poorer survival, independent of their role in T cell exclusion. An inflammatory-like cancer-associated fibroblast subset was associated with the stromal segregation of T cells and T cell exhaustion. Our findings highlight the differential impact of stromal subsets on immune infiltration and activation within the breast cancer TME with implications for patient outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Knowledge-informed multimodal cfDNA analysis improves sensitivity and generalization in cancer detection</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">De Falco, A., Grisolia, P., +37 authors, Ceccarelli, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liquid biopsy offers a minimally invasive opportunity to detect and monitor cancers through analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Still, current approaches face challenges of limited sensitivity at low tumor fractions, technical variability, and poor generalization across cohorts. Tumor-informed targeted approaches can have high specificity but low sensitivity due to random sampling, tumor adaptation and evolution (including the development of resistance mechanisms), and other sources of heterogeneity; on the contrary, genome-wide tumor-naive approaches can increase sensitivity but tend to have a lower specificity, especially at low tumor fraction. We developed Fragmentomics Analysis for Tumor Evaluation with AI (Fate-AI), a multimodal framework that integrates fragmentomic and methylation-derived features from low-pass whole-genome sequencing (LPWGS) and cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq). It leverages a knowledge-informed strategy to select recurrently altered genomic regions and tissue-specific methylation loci to combine the advantages of tumor-naive approaches with the specificity of tumor-informed approaches. This approach derives robust per-sample normalized features that mitigate batch effects and enhance cross-cohort reproducibility. We evaluated Fate-AI on a total of 1,219 plasma samples spanning ten cancer types and healthy controls from multiple laboratories and sequencing centers, including 432 newly profiled cases (280 with both cfMeDIP-seq and LPWGS) together with 787 samples from four independent public datasets. Fate-AI achieved superior sensitivity and specificity compared to state-of-the-art methods, detecting tumor-derived signals at fractions as low as 10-5 in experimental dilutions. Fate-AI scores correlated with disease stage and tracked longitudinal progression, anticipating relapse months before clinical progression. Furthermore, Fate-AI enabled tissue-of-origin classification, with AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.97 across six cancer types. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Fate-AI provides a sensitive, generalizable, and clinically actionable platform for early detection, minimal residual disease monitoring, and tissue-of-origin classification, supporting its potential as a liquid biopsy framework in precision oncology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multimodal prediction of metastatic relapse using federated deep learning in soft-tissue sarcoma with a complex genomic profile.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Charles Maussion, Jean-Michel Coindre, +15 authors, Marie Karanian</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Soft Tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of heterogeneous and complex diseases where being able to predict the appearance of metastases is key to inform clinical decisions, especially the prescription of adjuvant chemotherapy. We developed SarcNet: a multimodal deep-learning algorithm based on histological whole-slides and clinical variables to predict metastatic relapse in patients affected with limbs and trunk wall STS. Two independent series were investigated simultaneously in a privacy-enhanced multicentric setup using Federated Learning: Centre Léon Bérard (n = 221) and Institut Bergonié (n = 390). We then collected two additional validation cohorts from Centre Léon Bérard (n = 93) and Institut Bergonié (n = 124) to validate the performance of the trained algorithm. Evaluated in cross-validation setting on the first two cohorts, SarcNet achieved a performance of 0.797 AUC (Area Under the Receiver-operating characteristic Curve, 0.762-0.833) to predict 5-year MFS comparable to the Sarculator, current state-of-the-art nomogram (0.778 (0.743-0.814)), and outperforming the FNCLCC grading, widely used in practice (0.706 (0.670-0.743), P-value &lt; 0.001). On validation cohorts, SarcNet performance is still on-par to the Sarculator and FNCLCC rating. Interpretability investigations of SarcNet highlighted histological patterns driving the prediction of metastatic relapse such as atypia, tumor cellularity and anisokaryosis. This model may assist clinical decisions by identifying high-risk patients that could benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Li Y, Li P, +3 authors, Zhang Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective.To develop a machine learning-enhanced normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for predicting late sciatic nerve toxicity (LSNT) in sacrococcygeal chordoma (SC) and locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients undergoing carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT).Methods.This dual-modeling study analyzed 106 CIRT-treated SC/LRRC patients. Notice that the unit of Gy is the relative biological effectiveness -weighted dose with local effect model version I in this study for the prescription of our CIRT treatments. The hybrid framework integrated the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model with generalized machine learning. Radiation dosimetry (the equivalent uniform dose (EUD), the uniform dose over the sciatic nerve for a 50% complication probability [TD50], the parameter for the volume effect of the organ [n], the slop steepness of the dose response curve [m]) and biological parameters were analyzed through univariate/multivariate regression. Model performance was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity metrics.Results.16.9% (18/106) over all patients developed grade ⩾1 LSNT with no grade ⩾4 toxicity. Stratified outcome analysis across various subgroups revealed significant variations, especially that pathological subtype of re-irradiated rectal cancer exhibited manifested 15.6% G2 toxicity. We first successfully obtained coefficients for the NTCP models with univariate analysis by utilizing the correlation between significant variations of stratified outcome and TD50. We then establish an NTCP model by machine learning-enhanced multivariate analysis that allow identifying the critical dose-volume thresholds ofV62,V64, andD3ccto correlate dose-dependent progression of G1, G2, ad G3 toxicities, respectively.Significance.EUD &gt; 61.1 Gy significantly elevates G1 LSNT risk. Our center recommends:V62⩽ 6.2%,V64⩽ 4.69%,D3cc⩽ 32.3 Gy to balance tumor control and neuroprotection in CIRT planning. The n/m parameters provide critical insights into individual radiation sensitivity gradients across toxicity grades with machine learning-enhanced NTCP modeling for LSNT prediction in CIRT.</p>
