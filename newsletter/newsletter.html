<h2 class="paper-title">Iterative and modular expression of Botryococcus braunii genes enhances isoprenoid production in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Morelli, L., Jensen, C., +1 author, Fabris, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Isoprenoids are essential natural compounds with high structural and functional diversity. Among them, carotenoids and triterpenoids such as squalene have high biotechnological value but remain challenging to produce sustainably. The green microalga Botryococcus braunii synthesizes large amounts of triterpenoids through specialized methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway configurations involving distinct 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms, a bifunctional squalene synthase (SQS) and squalene synthase-like (SSL) enzymes working together for the synthesis of the compound. However, its slow growth limits industrial application. In this work, we established the fast-growing diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a heterologous chassis for terpenoid production using a synthetic biology Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)-based approach. Episomal uLoop assembly enabled rapid expression and evaluation of B. braunii DXS and SQS variants, enhancing precursor flux and resulting in the co-accumulation of squalene and carotenoids. This work demonstrates the functional transfer of specialized algal terpenoid enzymes into a tractable diatom host and highlight P. tricornutum's potential as a versatile platform for sustainable, high-value isoprenoid biosynthesis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Paradoxical gene regulation explained by competition for genomic sites</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jatkar, D. D., Aravind, K. M., +1 author, Del Vecchio, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how opposing regulatory factors shape gene expression is essential for interpreting complex biological systems. A motivating observation, drawn from cancer epigenetics, is that removing an activating factor can sometimes lead to higher, not lower, expression of a gene that is also subject to repression. This counterintuitive behavior suggests that competition between activators and repressors for limited genomic binding sites may produce unexpected transcriptional outcomes. Prior theoretical work proposed this mechanism, but it has been difficult to test directly in natural systems, where layers of chromatin regulation obscure causal relationships. This paper introduces a fully synthetic, tunable genetic platform in a prokaryotic model system that isolates this competition mechanism in a clean and interpretable setting. The engineered construct contains a target gene with binding sites for both an activator and a repressor, together with a separate decoy region that carries overlapping binding sites for the same regulators. Activator and repressor functions are implemented using CRISPRa and CRISPRi, which permit independent control of regulator expression levels and binding affinities. Using this minimal system, the paper shows that increasing activator expression can reduce expression of the target gene when both regulators are present, consistent with the prediction that additional activator molecules displace the repressor from decoy sites and allow it to more effectively repress the target. By demonstrating how competition alone can invert expected regulatory responses, this synthetic framework provides a validated model for understanding similar paradoxical behaviors in natural regulatory networks and establishes a foundation for future studies in more complex mammalian contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PhenoDEL as a Novel Screening Strategy Based on Intracellular Protein Degradation Activity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Onda, Y., Ochi, Y., +9 authors, Tanaka, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeted protein degradation (TPD), including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs), is a promising therapeutic approach. However, systematic discovery of such small molecules remains a major challenge. Here, we present PhenoDEL, a novel phenotypic DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening platform that integrates one-bead one-compound DEL (OBOC-DEL) with the Beacon(R) optofluidic system for high-throughput, single-cell analysis. By co-culturing individual OBOC-DEL beads and engineered reporter cells in nanoliter-scale chambers, PhenoDEL enables direct observation of compound-induced protein degradation at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate this approach by identifying compounds that induce degradation of FKBP12F36V-EGFP fusion proteins in PC-3 cells. The workflow allows precise linkage between compound identity and cellular phenotype via DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing. PhenoDEL overcomes limitations of conventional screening methods, offering high sensitivity, spatial control, and scalability. This platform holds significant potential for mechanism-driven drug discovery, including identification of novel PROTACs and MGDs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A benchmark of DNA methylation deconvolution methods for tumoral fraction estimation using DecoNFlow</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Giuili, E., Van de Velde, S., +9 authors, De Preter, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In cancer patients, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released into body fluids from both healthy and cancer cells. The proportion of tumor-derived cfDNA serves as a surrogate marker of tumor burden allowing disease monitoring. Tumoral cfDNA can be distinguished based on patient specific tumoral mutations or using more general tumor specific DNA methylation patterns, that are preserved on tumoral cfDNA. DNAm profiling of cfDNA thus enables non-invasive cancer detection and monitoring. However, accurately determining tumour fractions remains challenging due to the heterogeneous mixture of cfDNA sources in body fluids. Computational DNAm deconvolution methods address this by inferring cell-type contributions either with or without reference methylomes. While several tools exist and multiple benchmarking studies have been performed, none have specifically evaluated the sensitivity and accuracy of tumour-fraction estimation in cfDNA-focused contexts. Here, we benchmarked 10 reference-based and 2 reference-free DNAm deconvolution tools using 3,690 in silico mixtures spanning multiple tumour types, different bisulfite-based sequencing strategies and several sequencing depths. Overall, CelFiE showed the most accurate tumour-fraction estimation across the different conditions. Interestingly, reference-free methods demonstrated superior sensitivity for tumour detection, but consistent over-estimation of tumoral fraction. We further observed that sequencing depth strongly affects performance until sufficient saturation is achieved. To enable reproducible evaluation and tool selection within this benchmark, we developed DecoNFlow, a scalable Nextflow pipeline integrating 12 deconvolution tools and 3 marker selection methods, making it the most comprehensive pipeline for sequencing-based deconvolution up to date. Together, our findings provide practical guidance for tool selection in cfDNA tumour monitoring and establish DecoNFlow as a robust framework for benchmarking and applying DNAm deconvolution.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Molecular maps of diseases from omics data and network embeddings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hu, D., Schaap-Johansen, A.-L., +5 authors, Jensen, L. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying disease-relevant proteins and pathways remains a fundamental challenge in understanding disease mechanisms and supporting therapeutic development. While omics analyses can provide valuable insights, they typically consider each gene/protein separately rather than at the level of biological systems. This can be addressed by combining the omics data with protein networks. We integrate disease-specific omics data with a universal functional association network from STRING, which we represent using node2vec embedding. This way, we constructed disease maps for seven diseases spanning inflammatory, oncological, neurological, and vascular diseases based on genetics, transcriptomics, somatic mutation, and proteomics data. Compared to omics analysis alone, the use of a simple linear model on top of network embedding enabled us to identify 2--4 times as many known disease-relevant proteins at the same specificity. Clustering of the resulting disease maps revealed both functional modules shared by many diseases, such as inflammatory pathways and cancer hallmarks, and disease-specific modules, such as keratinization in atopic dermatitis and extracellular matrix remodeling in aortic aneurysm. Together, these results highlight the value of protein network embedding when analyzing omics data to understand diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Haplotype-resolved diploid genome inference on pangenome graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chandra, G., Doan, W. T., Gibney, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genotyping is the task of identifying the genetic variants present in a sample from sequencing data, and it is a fundamental problem in computational biology. Existing genotyping approaches typically rely on either haplotype reference panels or pangenome graphs. Compared to haplotype reference panels, pangenome graphs compactly represent both small and large variants, making them a powerful and expressive reference model. Motivated by the haplotype reconstruction framework of Li and Stephens, Chandra et al. [Genome Research, 2025] introduced a deterministic formulation for genotyping, reduced it to a haploid genome inference problem on pangenome graphs, proved its NP-hardness, and proposed integer linear and quadratic programming approaches with strong empirical performance. In this work, we introduce new problem formulations and scalable algorithms for inferring phased diploid genomes. We implement these methods in our tool DipGenie and evaluate phasing and structural variant calling accuracy on real Illumina short-read data. DipGenie achieves switch error rate as low as 0.7% and F1-score up to 0.6 on structural variant calling, compared to switch error rate of up to 7.0% and structural variant calling F1-scores of 0.5 for VG. These results show that DipGenie substantially reduces phasing errors while improving the accuracy of structural variant detection.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Computer-guided enzyme engineering of PET hydrolase mutants towards improved PET affinity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Balola, A., Ferreira, S., +4 authors, Rocha, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is an extensively used plastic whose durability and resistance to degradation contribute to growing environmental pollution and concerns. Enzymatic PET degradation, particularly via PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis, has emerged as a sustainable approach due to its ability to depolymerize PET under mild conditions. While research has largely focused on enhancing the enzyme's thermal stability through distal mutations, less attention has been given to active-site engineering aimed at directly improving catalytic efficiency. Here, we used an automated in silico protein engineering platform called Gene Discovery and Enzyme Engineering (GDEE), designed to systematically explore mutations at the active site. By leveraging FastPETase (FP) as scaffold, we perform a high throughput generation of thousands of variants, evaluated them via docking studies with a PET substrate analogue, and ranked candidates based on binding affinity and catalytic geometry. We identified S238Y as a key mutation that enhanced PET film degrading performance at 40 {degrees}C when inserted in two of the most active PETase variants reported to date: 2.2-fold increase in the FP scaffold and 3.4-increase in the ThermoStable-PETase (TSP) background. Compared to wild type PETase, FP S238Y showed a 14.8-fold increase in bulk activity, translating into 9.4-fold more TPA and 20-fold more MHET by UPLC, while TSP S238Y reached a 25.8-fold increase (14.4-fold more TPA and 42.6-fold more MHET). This mutation also enhanced catalytic efficiency and resistance to enzyme concentration inhibition, especially in the TSP scaffold. Molecular dynamics confirm position 238 as a relevant modulator of ligand stabilisation. These findings underscore the potential of targeted active-site engineering, combined with structure-guided prediction, to accelerate the development of efficient mesophilic biocatalysts for plastic waste remediation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Amaranth: Enhanced Single-Cell Transcript Assembly via Discriminative Modeling of UMI Reads and Internal Reads</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zang, X. C., Zahin, T., +3 authors, Shao, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed transcriptome profiling at cellular resolution. A central yet unsolved challenge is the accurate reconstruction of full-length transcripts for individual cells. Emerging scRNA-seq protocols can produce reads that span entire transcripts, enabling the isoform-level expression analysis. For example, Smart-seq protocols combine UMI-linked reads that index and stitch together multiple reads from the same molecule, with internal reads filling coverage gaps. Here, we report a previously unrecognized phenomenon that, UMI reads and internal reads exhibit markedly different biological and statistical properties in strandness, 5'/3' coverage bias, and locality distribution. Existing assemblers fail to leverage these distinctions and consequently yielding suboptimal assembly. We show that discriminative modeling of UMI reads and internal reads can drastically increase the assembly accuracy. Based on these insights, we developed Amaranth, a new single-cell assembler that implements a set of new heuristics specifically designed to address the distinct biases of UMI-linked and internal reads. These heuristics enable accurate assignment of strandness for internal reads, reliable refinement of the splicing graph, and precise determination of transcript start and end sites, collectively resulting in substantial improvements. We also developed Amaranth-meta, that integrates all cells to produce improved assembly for individual cells. Benchmarked on Smart-seq3 datasets from human and mouse, Amaranth outperformed other state-of-the-art assemblers in assembling individual cells and in meta-assembly. Amaranth advances isoform-level analysis in single-cell transcriptomics, facilitating detailed studies at cellular resolution.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Photocaged chloroquine derivatives for the light-dependent inhibition of autophagy in cancer stem cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Alonso-Manresa, S., Serra, C., +8 authors, Josa-Cullere, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibit autophagy and have shown promise as adjuvant anticancer agents, particularly for targeting therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, their clinical utility is limited by systemic toxicity and poor tumour selectivity. Here we report the design, synthesis, and photochemical evaluation of [7-(diethylamino)coumarin-4-yl]methyl (DEACM)-caged CQ and HCQ derivatives as visible-light-activated autophagy inhibitors. Selective caging of the aliphatic amine fully suppressed biological activity in the dark and enabled rapid, efficient release of the parent drugs upon illumination. The lead compound 1C displayed robust light-dependent cytotoxicity across multiple cancer cell lines and, upon photoactivation, recapitulated CQ's effects on LC3-II accumulation. In CSC-enriched tumourspheres, illumination of 1C completely abolished spheroid formation, demonstrating precise spatiotemporal control of stemness suppression. Importantly, ex vivo and in vivo studies confirmed that visible light penetrates tumour tissue sufficiently to activate 1C and release CQ within the tumour. These findings establish the first proof of concept for light-controlled autophagy inhibition and provide a blueprint for spatiotemporally confined anticancer therapies based on photopharmacological modulation of CSCs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">namiRa: A Comprehensive, Manually Curated Database for MicroRNA Expression, Function, and Deregulation in Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mohebbi, S., Dostmohammadi, A., +15 authors, Moradi, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, playing important roles in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Despite the growing recognition of miRNA significance, the contributed information remains scattered in the publications. This fragmentation underscores the need for a centralized and comprehensive database that consolidates miRNA expression patterns, functional roles, and regulatory interactions across diverse cancer types. So far, several miRNA databases have been developed, but neither of them enables in-depth functional analysis or comparative visualization of miRNA data. Here, we present namiRa, a manually curated database, to offer a comprehensive resource for miRNA expression and functional significance in various types of cancer, describing miRNA-cancer associations based on a thorough review of the literature. namiRa provides an extensive collection of miRNA expression profiles, detection methods, functional analyses for miRNAs in vitro and in vivo, and visualized regulatory networks across different cancer types. The current version of namiRa documents curated relationships between 1,077 human miRNAs and 33 types of human cancers, based on data from 9,884 published papers. namiRa is accessible at https://www.namira-db.com.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transfer learning with multiomics integration and deep neural networks reveals drug resistance mechanisms in cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Semih Alpsoy, Osman Ugur Sezerman</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drug resistance remains one of the primary challenges in effective cancer therapy. In this study, we employed a deep neural network (DNN)-based transfer learning (TL) approach to predict drug response and uncover drug resistance mechanisms. We integrated gene expression, somatic mutation, and copy number aberration (CNA) data with drug response profiles using multi-omics integration (MI). We used the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) data for training and incorporated drugs with same pathways into the training models. We then evaluated drug response predictions on independent in-vivo PDX Encyclopedia (PDX) and ex-vivo the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. In addition, we conducted pathway enrichment analyses to elucidate the mechanisms underlying drug resistance for paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine, and cetuximab. We also applied Fisher's exact test (FET) to assess potential associations between drug resistance and the presence of mutations or CNAs. Our pan-drug models outperformed other methods based on the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR). Our pathway enrichment analyses revealed LDHB-mediated pyruvate metabolism and FYN-mediated focal adhesion might have pivotal roles in paclitaxel resistance, while PINK1-mediated mitophagy might be critical in 5-FU resistance. In addition to transcriptional activation, FET suggested that CNAs in LDHB and PINK1 may also be associated with resistance to paclitaxel and 5-FU, respectively. Furthermore, enrichment results for paclitaxel and cetuximab indicated shared resistance mechanisms between the two drugs. Importantly, our findings are consistent with prior experimental studies, providing literature-based validation of our results. Overall, our DNN-based TL approach achieved strong predictive performance across PDX &amp; TCGA datasets and enrichment analyses provided valuable biological insights into drug resistance mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">scPER: A Rigorous Computational Approach to Determine Cellular Subtypes in Tumors Aligned With Cancer Phenotypes From Total RNA Sequencing.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bingrui Li, Xiaobo Zhou, Raghu Kalluri</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique for understanding cellular diversity, but processing large patient cohorts to identify phenotype-associated cell populations remains challenging. Here, scPER (Estimating cell Proportions using single-cell RNA-seq Reference), a rigorous approach combining adversarial autoencoder and extreme gradient boosting to estimate tumor microenvironment cell compositions and identify phenotype-associated subclusters for bulk RNA-seq samples. Integrating scRNA-seq datasets from diverse studies, scPER constructed comprehensive reference panels and disentangled confounders from true signals. scPER achieved superior accuracy in cellular proportion estimation compared to CIBERSORTx, BayesPrism, Scaden, MuSiC, SCDC, DeSide and ReCIDE. It showed high accuracy in predicting metastatic melanoma immunotherapy response and identified a critical T cell subcluster expressing FCRL3 and SLAMF7. In metastatic urothelial cancer, scPER predicted TGFβ-mediated inhibition of CD4 naïve T cells to diminish PD-L1 checkpoint blockade efficacy. scPER enables robust integration of scRNA-seq datasets to estimate cellular proportions across tumors and identify clinically relevant cell populations.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Active learning framework leveraging transcriptomics identifies modulators of disease phenotypes.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Benjamin DeMeo, Charlotte Nesbitt, +19 authors, Mauricio Cortes</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phenotypic drug screening remains constrained by the vastness of chemical space and the technical challenges of scaling experimental workflows. To overcome these barriers, computational methods have been developed to prioritize compounds, but they rely on either single-task models lacking generalizability or heuristic-based genomic proxies that resist optimization. We designed an active deep learning framework that leverages omics to enable scalable, optimizable identification of compounds that induce complex phenotypes. Our generalizable algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art models on classical recall, translating to a 13- to 17-fold increase in phenotypic hit rate across two hematological discovery campaigns. Combining this algorithm with a lab-in-the-loop signature refinement step, we achieved an additional twofold increase in hit rate along with molecular insights. In sum, our framework enables efficient phenotypic hit identification campaigns, with broad potential to accelerate drug discovery.</p>
