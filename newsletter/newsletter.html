<h2 class="paper-title">GONNECT: A Gene Ontology-guided Neural Network for Explainable Cancer Typing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lieftinck, M., Verlaan, T., Reinders, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are renowned for their high accuracy and versatility, which has led to their application in many fields of research, including biology. However, this accuracy often comes at the expense of interpretability, making it challenging to reason about the inner workings of most DNNs. Particularly in biological research, understanding the mechanisms behind specific outcomes is highly valuable. To elucidate the latent space of DNNs in the context of cancer biology, we introduce GONNECT: a Gene Ontology-derived Neural Network for Explainable Cancer Typing. GONNECT incorporates biological prior knowledge from the Gene Ontology (GO) directly into its network architecture, enabling interpretability through model structure. Using an autoencoder framework, we evaluate GONNECT as both encoder and decoder module and demonstrate its ability to learn which biological processes are distinctive for different cancer types. Furthermore, we show how a variant including soft links (GONNECT-SL) can expand on current knowledge by proposing new interactions between biological processes. GONNECT is flexible both in the amount of prior knowledge it incorporates and the set of input genes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RiboZAP: Custom Probe Design for rRNA Depletion in complex Metatranscriptomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bunga, S., Tan, A., +1 author, Kuersten, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metatranscriptomic (MetaT) sequencing provides critical insights into the gene expression and functional activity of microbial communities. However, its utility is limited by the overwhelming abundance of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which typically represents [≥]90% of total RNA [1-2]. A major obstacle to efficient MetaT analysis is the removal of highly abundant rRNA transcripts present in complex microbial communities, which may contain thousands of species. Although commercial rRNA depletion kits can effectively reduce rRNA content, they are typically optimized for specific host microbiomes and often underperform in others. For example, probes designed for the human gut microbiome frequently show reduced efficiency when applied to non-human samples such as mouse cecal donor samples - a common model in microbiome research. Regardless of the depletion strategy used, designing rRNA removal probes solely based on a microbiome's taxonomic composition often requires an extensive number of probes, making the approach expensive, difficult to manufacture, and sometimes technically impractical [3]. Here, we present RiboZAP, a species-agnostic computational pipeline for designing custom RNase H depletion probes directly from MetaT sequencing data and without prior knowledge of sample composition. Our results show that the probes generated with RiboZAP are efficient for removal of rRNA content, increasing messenger RNA (mRNA), and improving transcriptome coverage. This provides a cost-effective approach to maximize the value of MetaT sequencing.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metagenomic Classification of Ancient Viruses</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Marques, L. L., Pinho, A. J., Pratas, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ancient DNA (aDNA) sequences present unique challenges for taxonomic classification due to extreme fragmentation (reads 20-100 bp), end-biased cytosine deamination, and high contamination rates. Conventional metagenomic classifiers based on exact k-mer matching or alignment lose discriminative power on such short and damaged reads, limiting the analysis of paleogenomic samples. We present FALCON2, a compression-based metagenomic classifier that leverages position-aware finite-context models to maintain high accuracy on degraded viral ancient viruses. FALCON2 consolidates the capabilities of its predecessor, FALCON-meta, into a unified executable with enhanced features including model persistence, direct processing of compressed inputs, multiple file handling, and optional pre-filtering methodologies for contaminated samples. Under controlled benchmarking with database, taxonomy, and thread parity on simulated viral datasets, FALCON2 achieved an Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) of 0.999, an Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.968, and an F1-score of 0.918, substantially outperforming Centrifuge (AUPRC = 0.625), Kraken2 (AUPRC = 0.184), and CLARK-S (AUPRC = 0.013) on pooled micro-averaged metrics. FALCON2's advantage is most pronounced on ultra-short reads (20-40 bp), where exact k-mers become sparse. FALCON2 pre-filtering at threshold 0.7 improved precision by 10 percentage points with negligible recall loss. FALCON2 runs on systems with 4-8 GB RAM for typical analyses. FALCON2 is freely available at https://github.com/cobilab/FALCON2 under GPL v3 license.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-agent AI enables evidence-based cell annotation in single-cell transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ahuja, G., Antill, A., +4 authors, Dhapola, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell type annotation remains a critical bottleneck, with current methods often inaccurate and requiring extensive manual validation, particularly in disease contexts. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, they can be unreliable due to hallucinations. We developed CyteType, a multi-agent framework that generates competing hypotheses grounded in full expression data and study context, validates against external databases, and iteratively self-evaluates. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that CyteType substantially outperforms reference-based and LLM-based methods, with self-generated confidence scores reliably identifying trustworthy annotations. CyteType transforms cell type annotation from label assignment into evidence-grounded biological discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RNApdbee 3.0: A unified web server for comprehensive RNA secondary structure annotation from 3D coordinates</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pielesiak, J., Niznik, K., +5 authors, Zok, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNApdbee 3.0 (publicly available at https://rnapdbee.cs.put.poznan.pl/) offers an advanced pipeline for comprehensive RNA structural annotation, integrating 2D and 3D data to build detailed nucleotide interaction networks. It classifies base pairs as canonical or noncanonical using the Leontis-Westhof and Saenger schemes and identifies stacking, base-ribose, base-phosphate, and base-triple interactions. The tool handles incomplete or modified residues, marking missing nucleotides and distinguishing noncanonical base pairs for accurate and effective visualization. Results are provided in standard formats - namely, extended dot-bracket notation, BPSEQ, and CT - and in highly valuable graphical visualizations. RNApdbee decomposes secondary structures into stems, loops, and single strands and offers flexible pseudoknot encoding. Its unified framework addresses inconsistencies across structural data formats by standardizing all inputs to PDBx/mmCIF and integrating seven widely used annotation tools. Finally, RNApdbee ensures reliable, format-independent, and comprehensive RNA structural annotation and interpretation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genomic Perception Fusion: A Lightweight, Interpretable Kernel for Protein Functional Tuning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qurashi, S. U.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein design has been transformed by deep generative models ,but at the cost of interpretability, accessibility, and integration with sparse experimental feedback. Here, we introduce Genomic Perception Fusion (GPF), a biologically inspired algorithm that treats DNA not as inert code, but as a linear signal awaiting perceptual reconstruction. GPF transforms nucleotide sequences, augmented with non-coding regulatory context, into a high-order functional representation that predicts stability, solubility, and expression. Built from physicochemical first principles and literature-derived parameters, GPF runs on a laptop in under a second, yet accurately forecasts the effects of surface mutations in green fluorescent protein (GFP). Validated against computational benchmarks, GPF offers a frugal, transparent alternative to black-box design for rapid protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A metaproteomics-based meta study of samples from patients with inflammatory bowel disease identifies potential markers for diagnosis and therapy monitoring</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wolf, M., Knipper, L., +9 authors, Heyer, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal disorder involving recurring inflammation and pronounced microbial dysbiosis. Comprehensive studies with large patient cohorts are required to Identify meaningful biomarker candidates for diagnosing and monitoring IBD. In this large-scale meta-study of over 600 samples based on fecal metaproteomics, our goal was to validate known biomarkers and discover new candidates. We performed bioinformatic reanalysis using the Mascot search engine and MMUPHin for batch effect correction as well as knowledge graph-enhanced data analysis. We identified 59 protein groups that varied primarily due to disease, rather than laboratory conditions. These included Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, which was not reported in the original studies. Of these groups, 53 were differentially abundant in at least one of the two validation datasets. Additionally, 23 of the successfully validated protein groups, primarily from human neutrophil vesicles, were found to be significantly associated with remission during treatment in an independent dataset. This finding suggests their potential for disease monitoring. Validation in other disease contexts, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, diabetes, and colorectal cancer, revealed the necessity of biomarker panels, because individual biomarkers could only distinguish IBD from specific conditions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of metaproteomics meta-analyses in discovering and validating biomarker panels and assessing their specificity for IBD.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ELITE: E3 Ligase Inference for Tissue specific Elimination: A LLM Based E3 Ligase Prediction System for Precise Targeted Protein Degradation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Froehlich, H., Patajoshi, S., Madan, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has transformed modern drug discovery by harnessing the ubiquitin proteasome system to eliminate disease-driving proteins previously deemed undruggable. However, current approaches predominantly rely on a narrow set of ubiquitously expressed E3 ligases, such as Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL), which limits tissue specificity, increases systemic toxicity, and fosters resistance. Here, we present an AI-driven framework for the rational identification of tissue specific E3 ligases suitable for precision-targeted degradation. Our model leverages a BERT-based protein language architecture trained on billions of sequences to generate contextual embeddings that capture structural and functional motifs relevant for E3 substrate compatibility. By integrating these embeddings with tissue resolved protein protein interaction data, the framework predicts ligase/target interactions that are both biologically plausible and context restricted. This enables the prioritization of ligases capable of driving selective degradation of pathogenic proteins within disease-relevant tissues. The proposed approach offers a scalable path to expand the E3 ligase repertoire and advance TPD toward true precision medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ECLIPSE: Exploration of Complex Ligand-Protein Interactions through Learning from Systems-level Heterogeneous Biomedical Knowledge Graphs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Atas Guvenilir, H., Dogan, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Discovering new, efficacious molecules remains slow and costly; rigorous data science-driven systems-level approaches are therefore essential to prioritise hypotheses and de-risk drug development. In this study, we present ECLIPSE, a systems-level framework for compound/ligand-protein interaction (CPI) representation and prediction, combining heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode large-scale entity-relation structure, with graph neural networks that exploit relational inductive biases to perform inference on graph-structured data. ECLIPSE uses our comprehensive biomedical KG-based platform, CROssBAR, incorporating genes/proteins, drugs, compounds, pathways, diseases, and phenotypes, along with their multi-layered relationships. Each entity is assigned input features derived from language or graph representation learning models and projected via type-specific neural network layers. To process these featurized biomedical KGs for bioactivity prediction, we employed the heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) architecture. In contrast to the majority of GNN algorithms, which are restricted to homogenous graphs, HGT can handle graph heterogeneity and maintain node- and edge-type dependent representations through its attention mechanism. ECLIPSE achieves strong performance on challenging, protein-family-specific CPI benchmarks compared with baseline and state-of-the-art methods; ablations confirm performance gains from modelling graph heterogeneity and all feature sources. Use-case analyses on a druggable kinase (PIM1) and a historically undruggable receptor (HER3) illustrate generalizability across target classes and activity ranges. By leveraging direct and indirect relationships embedded in biomedical KGs, ECLIPSE provides context-aware CPI inference that is scalable to real-world settings. Code, datasets, and trained models are released to support reproducibility and reuse.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Qian, J., Yang, L., +1 author, Qi, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein solubility is a critical physicochemical property influencing protein stability, therapeutic efficacy, and overall developability in drug discovery. However, traditional experimental methods for assessing solubility are often resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these limitations, computational approaches leveraging artificial intelligence have emerged, yet current models generally treat qualitative classification and quantitative regression as separate tasks and rely predominantly on sequence-based information, neglecting crucial structural and surface characteristics. Here, we introduce Pro4S, a novel multimodal predictive model that integrates protein language models, structural data, and surface descriptors using advanced contrastive learning techniques. Our unified framework achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability for both qualitative and quantitative solubility assessments. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Pro4S consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictors across diverse datasets. Furthermore, by applying Pro4S to the emerging area of de novo protein design, we validated a strong correlation between predicted solubility and experimental expression levels, reducing the proportion of non-expressed proteins by 52.7% while retaining 96.7% of highly expressed proteins. This highlights Pro4S's potential to serve as a reliable upfront screening tool for increasing expression success rates and accelerating rational protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Sequential Triple-Drug Strategy for Selective Targeting of p53-Mutant Cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bakin, A. V., Alruwaili, M., +9 authors, Fountzilas, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The tumor suppressor TP53 gene (p53) is mutated in most human malignancies but existing treatment options are largely ineffective, lack selectivity, and cause toxic side effects. To address these clinical problems, we have developed a two-drug treatment that induces lethal DNA damage and G2-arrest in p53 mutant cancer cells. Here, we present a triple-drug therapeutic strategy that combines our two-drug regimen with a G2-checkpoint kinase inhibitor. The two-drug treatment with TAS102 plus PARP inhibitor (PARPi) acts as an inducer-amplifier pair to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and a prolonged G2-arrest specifically in p53 mutant cells. Subsequent inhibition of the G2-checkpoint kinases, such as WEE1 or ATR, releases these G2-arrested cells into mitosis, leading to cell death. The delayed administration of a G2-kinase inhibitor provides p53 wild-type cells with time to repair DNA, thereby minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. This sequential triple-drug strategy exhibited robust efficacy in preclinical models of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Together, our findings illustrate a promising inducer-amplifier-terminator triple-drug strategy for targeting p53 mutant malignancies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hybrid Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-Branching Modeling of Pediatric Leukemia Evolution: A Computational Extension and Cohort-Level Application</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kim, S.-H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pediatric cancers evolve under developmental constraints that limit mutational diversity yet preserve adaptive potential. A computational extension of the Hybrid Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)-Branching framework was developed to model clonal diversification and phenotypic stabilization in pediatric leukemia. The OU component captures mean-reverting dynamics representing developmental homeostasis, while the branching component introduces stochastic lineage bifurcation and extinction. Using de-identified clinical metadata from Ahlgren et al. (Nature Communications, 2025; 16:8964), the model simulates patient-specific evolutionary trajectories across relapse categories and disease subtypes (B-ALL, T-ALL, MPAL, AML). Simulations reproduce observed clinical trends-rapid relapse and limited diversification in early or refractory KMT2A-r ALL, and slower, therapy-resistant relapses in AML. Group- and patient-level analyses demonstrate how the balance between stabilizing selection (theta) and diversification rate (lambda) determines clonal persistence and phenotypic drift. This computational implementation provides a quantitative framework for linking developmental constraint, clonal diversity, and therapeutic response in pediatric malignancies and establishes a tractable platform for model-driven hypothesis testing and translational oncology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative single-cell and spatial mapping of oxidative stress response uncovers GCLC+ mesenchymal tumor cell state linked with favorable outcomes in triple negative breast cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Girnius, N., Vallius, T., +14 authors, Farkkila, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inhibiting oxidative stress response (OSR) proteins has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the cell type specificity and spatial distribution of OSR genes and proteins, such as GCLC and NQO1, is unknown. Using single cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets we found that OSR genes were highly expressed in TNBC tumor cells, which localized in spatial clusters. Multiplex immunofluorescence imaging of 345 TNBC samples from 186 patients demonstrated that OSR proteins GCLC and NQO1 exhibit distinct expression profiles across tumor, immune, and stromal cell populations and are elevated in inflamed histological regions. Tumor cell OSR protein expression was associated with the composition of the adjacent cellular neighborhood. Furthermore, we identified GCLC and vimentin positive (GCLC+VIM+) mesenchymal-like tumor cells, residing near immune cells and exhibiting increased proliferation and decreased anastasis signatures, suggesting sensitivity to chemotherapy. Across a panel of thirteen TNBC cell lines, GCLC expression was positively correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with higher proportions of GCLC+VIM+ tumor cells had a longer overall survival. Collectively, our results demonstrate that individual OSR proteins are expressed in distinct microenvironments and tumor cell states, potentially contributing to patient outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Taxonomy-free fecal microbiome profiles enable robust prediction of immunotherapy response and toxicity in melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lucas, A., Reale, M., +12 authors, Auslander, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The gut microbiome has been causally linked to the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI), prompting numerous clinical trials of microbiome-targeting strategies. Yet, mechanisms by which gut microbiota shape immune responses remain elusive as taxonomic biomarkers have failed to generalize across multiple cohorts. In this study, we develop a taxonomy-agnostic framework to identify microbial biomarkers of ICI response and immune-related adverse event (irAE) occurrence from metagenomic sequencing. Applying this approach to four independent melanoma cohorts from clinical centers across the United States, we uncover gut microbial proteins produced by diverse bacterial taxa that consistently predict ICI response. Notably, we uncover a previously uncharacterized operon involved in cellular redox homeostasis that is encoded by different bacteria and reliably predicts irAE occurrence. We further validated the predictive power of this operon in a prospectively sequenced melanoma cohort. Our results demonstrate that taxa-agnostic microbial protein biomarkers are robust, generalizable, and provide a path towards pretreatment risk stratification for melanoma patients initiating ICI therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BAP1 modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and balances liver homeostasis and malignant progression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tschaharganeh, D. F., Seretny, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective: Primary liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and harbors recurrent mutations in chromatin regulators such as BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), yet their functional impact remains unclear. We investigated how BAP1 deficiency affects liver homeostasis and tumorigenesis to clarify its functional role. Design: We employed inducible, liver-specific BAP1 knockdown in mice subjected to diet-induced metabolic stress (including rescue experiments), alongside autochthonous hydrodynamic CRISPR models, and profiled livers by RNA-seq, immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Complementary mechanistic assays in liver cancer cells examined the unfolded protein response (UPR) under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; findings were supported by immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analyses of BAP1-mutant patient samples. Results: BAP1 safeguards liver homeostasis under diet-induced metabolic stress, as its loss triggers ER stress, hepatocyte death, and acute liver failure. Lipidomics revealed a shift toward ER-stress-associated dyslipidemia, and transcriptomics showed negative enrichment of fatty-acid metabolism and positive enrichment of UPR pathways. In contrast, BAP1 loss synergizes with oncogenic drivers to accelerate tumorigenesis in autochthonous liver cancer models, underscoring its context-dependent tumor suppressor function. Mechanistically, BAP1 directly regulates the ER stress mediator DDIT3 (CHOP) through chromatin remodeling, linking BAP1 loss to maladaptive stress responses. Consistently, elevated CHOP expression was observed in BAP1-mutant human liver cancers and other tumor types. Conclusion: These findings establish BAP1 as a key chromatin regulator that connects stress adaptation to both liver homeostasis and tumorigenesis, highlighting the BAP1-UPR axis for future translational assessment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative Multi-Omics and Artificial Intelligence: A New Paradigm for Systems Biology.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shashi Kant, Deepika, Saheli Roy</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing accessibility of high-throughput omics technologies has represented a paradigm change in systems biology, facilitating the systematic exploration of biological complexity at genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels. Contemporary systems biology more and more depends on integrative multi-omics strategies to unravel the sophisticated, dynamic networks of cellular function and organismal phenotypes. Such methodologies enable scientists to clarify molecular interactions, decipher disease pathology, identify strong biomarkers, and guide precision medicine and synthetic biology initiatives. Recent technological breakthroughs in computational tools, ranging from early or late data integration, network analysis, and machine learning, have overcome obstacles of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and perturbations restricted to specific contexts. In this review, we critically assess the principles, methods, and applications of multi-omics integration, with an emphasis on cancer biology, microbial engineering, and synthetic biology. We showcase case studies in which integrative omics provided actionable findings. Finally, we address current limitations (e.g., data heterogeneity, interpretability) and forthcoming solutions (artificial intelligence, single-cell omics, cloud platforms). By closing the gap between molecular layers, multi-omics integration is moving toward predictive models of biological systems and revolutionary biotechnological applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dual-arc VMAT machine parameter optimization for localized prostate cancer using deep reinforcement learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mekki L, Hrinivich WT, Lee J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective.To develop and evaluate a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for rapid and automatic machine parameter optimization of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans for localized prostate cancer.Approach.A multi-task policy network combining convolution and long short-term memory was trained to sequentially predict the set of actions on the dose rate and multi-leaf collimator positions over the range of two arcs. The network uses as input the cumulative dose grid at the current gantry angle, contours of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk, and the set of machine parameters at all preceding gantry angles. The method was evaluated on a set of 15 localized prostate cancer patients for a prescription dose of 60 Gy in 20 fractions. For each case, the final state dose distribution was compared against clinical plans. For seamless integration with the clinical workflow, the proposed model was integrated into a clinical treatment planning system (TPS), enabling dosimetric review and final plan adjustments.Main results.The RL framework produced deliverable dual-arc VMAT plans in an average of 20.7 ± 5.0 s over the test set. Dosimetric comparison to clinical plans showed no statistically significant differences for the mean rectum dose as well as for the bladder V6160 Gy, indicating that the RL model was as efficient in sparing these structures as human planners. While the approach showed limitations in terms of PTV coverage and maximum body dose, our proposed integration to TPS showed the RL plans could be automatically refined to clinical quality in an additional 83.8 ± 7.2 s.Significance.The accuracy and fast run time of the approach show the potential of the framework to significantly streamline VMAT treatment planning and enable adaptive radiation therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Explainable Machine Learning for Preoperative Relapse Prediction in Molecularly Stratified Endometrial Cancer: A Single-Center Finnish Cohort Study</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Moreno SV, Khatun M, +4 authors, Modhukur V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Relapse risk in endometrial carcinoma (EC) is strongly influenced by molecular subtype, yet current WHO/ESGO classifications rely on postoperative data, limiting their utility for preoperative decision-making. We developed and compared interpretable machine learning (ML) models to predict relapse timing (none, ≤6 months, &gt;6 months) using exclusively preoperative multimodal data. In a retrospective cohort of 784 EC patients, we integrated clinicopathological, molecular, immunohistochemical, and systemic biomarkers and constructed four feature strategies: (1) Traditional (clinicopathology), (2) ESGO (guideline risk groups), (3) TP53 + MMRd (high-risk biology), and (4) POLE (low-risk biology). Classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GBM)) were trained with leakage-safe preprocessing and in-fold resampling; performance was evaluated via area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, and F1 score, and interpretability via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The RF-based Traditional model achieved the highest overall performance (F1 = 0.895, AUC = 0.84), while the GBM-based POLE model showed superior sensitivity (F1 = 0.886, AUC = 0.842). SHAP identified ARID1A loss, elevated CA125, thrombocytosis, and p16 expression among key predictors of relapse; while overlapping high-risk features across models included advanced stage, deeper myometrial invasion, elevated CA125, and positive cytology. These biologically coherent, explainable predictions support individualized risk stratification and may enhance preoperative decision-making, particularly for aggressive histology and high-risk molecular subtypes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">XGBoost- and Mass Spectrometry-Based Feature Selection for Identifying Metabolic Biomarkers Associated with HBV-Related Liver Disease Progression and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shao-Hua Li, Ming Song, +4 authors, Hui Li</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, is widely recognized for its efficiency and robustness in multiclass classification tasks. Metabolomics serves as a powerful tool for biomarker discovery; however, metabolic biomarkers associated with the progression from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) to liver cirrhosis (LC) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as those related to treatment effects in HCC (HCCAT), remain unclear. In this study, an XGBoost-based machine learning approach combined with mass spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles of 30 healthy controls (HC), 29 CHB patients, 30 LC patients, 30 HCC patients, and 30 HCCAT patients. Biomarker screening was conducted through three comparative analyses: (1) HC, CHB, LC, HCC, and HCCAT; (2) HC, CHB, LC, and HCC; and (3) HC, HCC, and HCCAT. A total of 17 metabolic biomarkers were identified, among which nine had not been previously associated with HBV-related liver diseases. Notably, a potential biomarker panel composed of eicosenoic acid, dihydromorphine, cysteine, acetic acid, sitosterol, and hypoxanthine showed promise for disease prognosis and therapeutic evaluation. These findings highlight the great potential of integrating metabolomics with machine learning to identify novel metabolic biomarkers related to HBV-associated liver disease progression and treatment response.</p>
