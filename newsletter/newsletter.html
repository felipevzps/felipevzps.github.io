<h2 class="paper-title">Innovative Prevention Approach for Pan Allergens-Induced Allergy: Effective Regulation of Heat Shock Protein 70 and Profilin 3 by siRNA-Loaded Nanomaterial</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zheng, S. H., Liang, Z., +2 authors, Zhang, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Currently, the widely accepted approach to addressing pollen allergy primarily through altering the immune system of patients. However, the great potential of genetic engineering for downregulating allergenic proteins and reducing allergenicity is often overlooked in previous studies. Here, we report an effective solution to reducing plant allergenicity by utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) technology to calibrate levels of pan-allergenic proteins Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP 70) and Profilin 3 (PFN 3) in transgenic Arabidopsis, Tobacco, and Osmanthus. This has been shown in research to effectively mitigate and prevent allergenic reactions in humans. 21-bp long siRNA sequences encased by Polyethyleneimine modified carbon dots (PEI-CDs) are synthesized to constitute a nanoparticle-mediated delivery system to efficiently deliver small- interfering RNA (siRNA) vectors into plants. Afterwards, RNA was extracted from Osmanthus fragrans and Gardenia jasminoides and underwent reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The result indicated the expected suppression of mRNA corresponding to the targeted proteins, proving the functional aspect of RNAi in allergen suppression trunk injection and suggesting its applicability in real-life scenarios.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Going beyond size: Exploring the metabolic burden inPseudomonas putida during heterologous proteinproduction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Beentjes, M., Ortega-Arbulu, A.-S., +2 authors, Pflüger-Grau, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In biotechnological applications, it is often necessary to introduce genes or entire pathways into a host cell, which can create a significant metabolic burden on the host, limiting productivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the physiological stress responses of Pseudomonas putida during heterologous protein production using a modular monitoring system consisting of a plasmid encoding a heterologous protein fused to eGFP and a chromosomally integrated capacity reporter. Our findings reveal that translation is the main bottleneck, with translational capacity becoming saturated under high expression loads. While increasing the strength of the RBS improved protein production for non-burdensome proteins, this effect was not observed for larger fusion proteins. Variations in fusion protein size suggested that it is not the overall mass of the produced protein, but rather the length of the mRNA transcript, that contributes to metabolic burden. We further evaluated how resource availability affects protein expression by modifying the metabolic regime or supplementing with amino acids. While the carbon source affected cellular capacity, it did not significantly alter heterologous protein production. Amino acid supplementation alleviated the growth defects of MBPeGFP-producing cells and modestly improved protein production rates. Together, these findings emphasize that metabolic burden is influenced not only by the size of the produced protein but also by transcript architecture, resource allocation, and the physiological state of the host. Therefore, successful optimization of heterologous protein production requires a holistic approach integrating construct design with host physiology and cultivation strategies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Structure-based design of antibody repertoires with drug-like properties</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tennenhouse, A., Wilen, R., +7 authors, Fleishman, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Animal immunization is the prevalent strategy for discovering antibody therapeutics, but it is a lengthy and poorly controlled process. As an alternative, antibody repertoires can be synthesized by recombining human antibody genes and introducing random mutations in their complementarity-determining regions. Synthetic repertoires can deliver binders quickly and without associated animal-welfare concerns, but the resulting antibodies often fail to exhibit drug-like biophysical properties. We developed a principled structure- and energy-based strategy, called CADAbRe, for designing repertoires of human antibodies that are stable by design. Every antibody was programmed to ensure its stability while maximizing the structural diversity of the entire repertoire. We also developed a cost-effective strategy for repertoire assembly and, as a proof of concept, synthesized over 500 million unique antibodies based on hundreds of human antibody gene combinations and designed CDR H3 sequences. Structurally diverse binders against four unrelated antigens exhibited affinities, specificities, and drug-like properties seen in therapeutic leads. CADAbRe is the first programmable structure-based strategy for antibody-repertoire design, enabling design-test-learn cycles towards high-quality universal and customized repertoires. We envision that these will accelerate and rationalize basic and applied antibody discovery and optimization while addressing animal-welfare concerns. The repertoire will be available for academic research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A transcription factor-responsive enhancer discovery platform for targeted immunotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jia, Y., Chen, C.-Y., +12 authors, Wu, M.-R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic enhancers with high specificity are crucial for therapeutic gene control. Although existing experimental screens and machine learning-based designs have advanced their discovery, these strategies remain context-restricted, typically requiring new cell-type- or state-specific libraries or datasets for each context, thus limiting their generalizability and scalability for broad biomedical applications. Because transcription factor (TF) activity naturally varies across cell types and cellular states, a high-coverage library of TF-responsive synthetic enhancers provides a universal starting point for identifying cell-type- or state-specific elements across diverse biological contexts. Harnessing this principle, we developed the TREND (transcription factor-responsive enhancer discovery) platform, a massively parallel reporter assay framework comprising 57,715 designs covering 1,068 TFs. To demonstrate its utility, we applied TREND to ovarian cancer and identified cancer-selective synthetic enhancers that discriminate cancer cells from normal epithelial cells. Building on these synthetic enhancers, we developed a protein-interaction-based AND-gate circuit that enables tighter control and enhanced transcriptional strength. In murine ovarian cancer models, these synthetic enhancers and AND-gate circuits achieved tumor-restricted activity and potent antitumor efficacy when driving combinatorial immune payloads. Extending TREND to immune cell engineering, we identified synthetic enhancers with stronger inducibility in the activated state and lower basal activity than conventional NFAT-motif-based enhancers in T cells. Together, these findings position TREND as a more generalizable framework for identifying synthetic enhancers with high contextual specificity, offering a versatile tool for precise gene regulation and context-aware therapeutic design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Conservation of non-consensus nucleotides in transcription factor binding sites</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Belousova, J., Moran-Tovar, R., +1 author, Gelfand, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factors (TFs) affect gene expression by binding to their sites (TFBSs) in the genome. As regulation of transcription is essential for the optimization of metabolism, evolution of TFBSs is thought to be restricted by the TF binding preferences. This means that nucleotides important for binding (consensus nucleotides, CNs) experience the pressure of negative selection and, therefore, are highly conserved. However, for some regulated genes, the strongest possible repression or activation may not necessarily be optimal (i.e. provide the highest fitness). Here, we show that, along with CNs, nucleotides causing relatively weaker binding (nonconsensus nucleotides, NCNs) are sometimes preserved by negative selection. We then consider several possible reasons for the conservation of NCNs and demonstrate that NCNs depend epistatically on other loci of the same TFBS for a substantial fraction of TFBSs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PhaLP 2.0: extending the community-oriented phage lysin database with a SUBLYME pipeline for metagenomic discovery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Boulay, A., Nemeth, V., +6 authors, Vazquez, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As biology grows increasingly data-driven, so too does the field of phage lysins, enzymes that degrade bacterial cell walls and hold promise as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. Five years ago, we introduced PhaLP, a centralized resource for Phage Lytic Protein sequences and associated metadata to support global research efforts. Here, we present PhaLP 2.0, a significantly enhanced database designed to overcome key challenges in the computational study of lysins by integrating the newly identified lysins obtained from thousands of metagenomes. To expand the known diversity of lysins beyond those from cultured phages, we developed SUBLYME, a protein embedding-based machine learning Software designed to Uncover and classify Bacteriophage Lysins in Metagenomic datasets. Using embeddings derived from the prior well-curated protein sequences of the original PhaLP database, we trained support vector machines to distinguish lysins from non-lysins in viromes and classify them as either endolysins or virion-associated lysins. The models achieved an average F1-score of 98% on held-out lysin clusters. SUBLYME enabled the discovery of 743,000 new lysin sequences from EnVhogDB, a virome-derived protein database, increasing the number of known lysin clusters by a factor of 40, from 1,000 to 40,000. PhaLP 2.0 entries were annotated by integrating Pfam functional predictions to the refined delineations obtained with SPAED, an algorithm that leverages the predicted aligned error matrix from AlphaFold predictions to identify domain boundaries. Both SUBLYME and the PhaLP 2.0 database are accessible online at https://github.com/Rousseau-Team/sublyme and http://phalp.ugent.be, respectively. Together, these advances establish PhaLP 2.0 as a comprehensive and scalable portal for the discovery, classification, and sequence analysis of phage lysins, paving the way for future antibacterial applications and evolutionary insights.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SPARK: deciphering tumor-specific signaling networks through an integrative predictive model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, D., Zhang, A., Li, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While kinase-substrate associations (KSAs) are fundamental to cancer signaling, their rewiring patterns and functional roles across different cancers during cancer progression remain generally poorly char- acterized. Current predictive tools often fail to integrate three-dimensional structural constraints and cancer- specific dynamic information, limiting their biological relevance and translational potential. To address this, the present study constructs SPARK, a machine learning framework that integrates multi-modal features within cancer-specific contexts. These include data-driven features (such as phosphoproteomic co-expression, mu- tual information, protein-level abundance, and phosphosite-level abundance), knowledge-driven features (e.g., STRING protein-protein interactions), and structural features (ESM-2 embeddings compressed via an autoen- coder). The training of the model was done with the adoption of the XGBoost classifier on data from eight CPTAC cancer cohorts. SPARK demonstrates strong predictive performance across different cancer types, with AUROC values ranging from 0.929 to 0.957 (mean: 0.944) in normal tissues and 0.941 to 0.958 (mean: 0.948) in tumor tissues. The accuracy of these predictions was further validated against experimentally determined kinase-substrate specificities. Using SPARK's predictions, tissue-specific phosphorylation signaling networks are systematically reconstructed. These SPARK-derived networks reveal distinct phosphorylation patterns and kinase activation landscapes across cancers while identifying several highly tissue-specific kinases as promis- ing therapeutic targets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">COFFEE-PRESC: A fast pre-screening method using compound retrieval by pairwise positional relationship of representative fragments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shimizu, M., Yoneyama, S., +1 author, Akiyama, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-ligand docking is one of the most widely used methods in structure-based virtual screening in the early stages of drug discovery. Its calculations require approximately one minute per compound, making exhaustive evaluation of ultra-large libraries containing billions of molecules computationally impractical. In this study, we propose COFFEE-PRESC (COmpound Filtering by Fragment pair-based Efficient Evaluation for PRE-SCreening), a fast, fragment-based pre-screening method. COFFEE-PRESC first docks fragments in a pre-constructed fragment set to the target protein and enumerates multiple favorable protein-fragment docking poses and then pairs them to consider pairwise positional relationship. The fragment set is composed of a small number of representative fragments that exhibit high similarity to many other fragments, enabling coverage of a large and diverse chemical space. Compounds that contain stuructures similar to fragment pairs are then retrieved through similarity-based searches. This retrieval methodology guarantees that the mutual positional relationship of the two matched fragments does not spatially collide. Finally, the retrieved compounds are evaluated using docking scores of the representative fragments and similarity values between the representative and individual fragments matched in the compound retrieval process. COFFEE-PRESC was 32-fold faster while higher accuracy than Spresso, a existing pre-screening tool, highlighting its potential for application to ultra-large compound library screening.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GDA-Pred: Generative AI-Driven Data Augmentation for Improved Prediction of IL-6 and IL-13 Inducing Peptides</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kurata, H., Tsuruta, H., +2 authors, Maeda, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The identification of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) inducing peptides is crucial for accelerating drug discovery targeting cancer, immune disorders, and infectious diseases. However, experimental screening methods remain time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, various machine learning and deep learning models have been developed, yet their performance is still constrained by the limited availability of experimentally validated data. In this study, we propose a generative AI-driven data augmentation (GDA) framework and predictor, GDA-Pred, to improve the prediction performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) classifiers for identifying IL-6 and IL-13 inducing peptides. GDA expands the training dataset by generating novel peptide sequences using three types of generative AI models: generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models (DMs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The GDA framework is defined by four key parameters: the type of generative model, the sequence identity cutoff, the probability threshold (PT) for selecting generated peptides, and the augmentation ratio (AR) between generated and real peptides. Since optimizing these parameters is challenging with small datasets, we adopt a case study-oriented proof-of-concept approach using a moderately sized dataset of anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) to derive interpretable optimal settings. The performance of the optimized GDA was evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation with cluster-based partitioning and a hold-out test on benchmark datasets. The optimized GDA was then applied to SOTA classifiers, collectively termed GDA-Pred, to identify IL-6 and IL-13 inducing peptides, both of which are limited by small dataset sizes. GDA-Pred substantially improved the prediction performance for both cytokine-inducing peptide tasks, demonstrating the feasibility of GDA-Pred as a robust and generalizable framework.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">liu, n., shen, c., zhou, t., zhou, y., yuan, h., bi, h., wang, y., Pei, X., +2 authors, Shi, Y., shen, b.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abnormal accumulation of oncometabolite fumarate drives susceptibility in fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-dRCC), but the precise mechanisms remain not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that high fumarate levels impair activation of ATR-CHK1 signaling in response to replication stress and DNA damage. Mechanistically, fumarate modifies RPA1, an essential factor for ATR-CHK1 activation through succination, a post-translational modification. Succination of RPA1 occurs mainly at cysteine residues 481 and 486, which reduces its binding affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). RPA1 succination leads to deficient recruitment of TOPBP1 to ssDNA, resulting in attenuated CHK1 activation and defective cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Succinated RPA1 compromises homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. Our findings establish that fumarate-induced succination of RPA1 impairs DNA repair and cell cycle control, promoting genomic instability in FH-dRCC. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which oncometabolites contribute to genomic instability.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Precise Control of Switchable Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Allows Enhanced Safety and Less T Cell Exhaustion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Z. A., Herring, L., +4 authors, Liu, W. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have achieved remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies, yet their clinical utility remains limited by safety concerns, poor persistence, and T-cell exhaustion driven by continuous receptor signaling. Although switchable CAR systems offer external control, most existing designs are irreversible, binary, or compromising CAR-T potency. Here, we introduce a chemically switchable CAR platform that enables graded, reversible regulation of CAR-T activity while retaining full therapeutic capacity. Using engineered CAR-T cells, we evaluate drug-controlled activation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release against CD19 tumor cells and screened clinically approved NS3/4A inhibitors to identify optimal small-molecule controllers. Compared with conventional CAR-T cells, switchable CAR-T cells exhibited minimal background activity in the OFF state, preventing antigen-driven activation and cytokine release in the absence of drug. Upon drug addition, CAR expression was rapidly restored, with full-length CAR detectable within 1 hour and ~80% of maximal expression achieved by 4 hours. Reversible suppression of CAR expression protected normal CD19 B cells once malignant cells were eliminated, addressing the clinical challenge of persistent CD19 CAR-T activity that can lead to B-cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent infections. Furthermore, switchable CAR-T cells displayed reduced exhaustion, enhanced persistence, stable CAR expression, and preferential central memory differentiation following tumor clearance. Together, these findings establish the switchable CAR-T system as a next-generation, reversible, and clinically compatible CAR-T platform.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metabolic medications modify prostate cancer progression through exosome reprogramming</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seen, M., Llevenes, P., +7 authors, Denis, G. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Among prostate cancer patients, co-morbid Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with faster progression to biochemical recurrence and increased risk of mortality. Previous work from our lab provides evidence that exosomes purified from media of insulin resistant adipocytes or T2D patient plasma likely drives these outcomes by delivering miRNAs that exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in several breast and prostate cancer models. Here, we build on our previous findings to investigate whether treatment with metabolic medications attenuates the tumor promoting effects of exosomes. We found that human DU145 cells, a model for prostate cancer, treated with plasma exosomes from T2D patients, shows patterns in global gene transcription that resolve by patient treatment with metformin. To test the effects of metformin experimentally, we used a murine model of insulin resistance (IR). Treating DU145 cells with miRNAs purified from the plasma exosomes of IR mice, we found that cells transfected with miRNAs from the metformin-treated IR group displayed significantly less migration than cells transfected with miRNAs from the unmedicated IR group. We suggest that metformin may partially reverse effects of T2D to exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by modifying the miRNA payload of plasma exosomes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A morphology-based machine learning model for scoring epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity using organelle dynamics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Justin Slager, Francesca Gatto, +5 authors, Jonas Fuxe</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Re-activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key developmental process, contributes to cancer progression and therapy resistance. Modulating EMT could be attractive as a therapeutic strategy, but there is a lack of methods that can quantify EMT states, including hybrid phenotypes. Here, we developed a morphology-based machine learning approach to score EMT based on changes in organelle dynamics. Using the Cell Painting assay and high-throughput microscopy, we trained a histogram gradient boosting classifier to identify stage-specific organelle remodeling during a time course of TGF-β1-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells. The model achieved robust performance across datasets, capturing EMT kinetics, hybrid states, and reversal by mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Importantly, the method accurately scored EMT in human breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells undergoing hypoxia-induced EMT, demonstrating cross-species, cross-inducer, and cross-cancer applicability. The results establish organelle morphology profiling as a scalable framework for quantifying epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. The method offers a platform for drug discovery and identifying strategies to overcome EMT-associated resistance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Development and Validation of an Intratumor Heterogeneity-Based Prognostic Model for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Filho VOC, Passos PRC, +4 authors, Leite GGF.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by marked intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which contributes to therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to develop a robust prognostic model for stratifying patients with ccRCC on the basis of ITH. RNA-seq data from 522 patients with ccRCC in TCGA-KIRC were analyzed using the DEPTH algorithm to quantify ITH, with external validation in the E-MTAB-1980 cohort (N = 101). Differentially expressed genes between high and low DEPTH tumors were identified, and a machine learning framework was applied to develop the ITHscore. The ITHscore was compared with other published signatures in literature for ccRCC. The random survival forest model on the basis of three genes (UBE2C, MOCOS, and MELTF) was selected to compose the ITHscore, showing high accuracy in the development (5-year AUC = 0.957) and in the validation cohorts (5-year AUC = 0.82). The ITHscore had the best performance across all 45 retrieved signatures in both development and validation data sets. High-ITHscore tumors exhibited immunosuppressive microenvironments and were associated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance signatures. The ITHscore was significantly associated with poor overall survival in five distinct tumor types across a meta-analysis of 104 independent data sets comprising 18,004 patients. We developed and validated the ITHscore, a three-gene expression-based model with superior prognostic performance in ccRCC. The ITHscore reflects key features of aggressiveness in tumor biology, including immune evasion and ICB resistance. Its minimal gene set and consistent performance across data sets support its potential for clinical implementation in ccRCC stratification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The - 216G/T polymorphism in the EGFR gene: A review focusing on Non-Small lung cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Obradovic J, Jurisic V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key regulator of cell proliferation and a well-established therapeutic target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene have been widely studied in the context of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but germline polymorphisms as potentially predictive biomarkers have emerged as a variants of interest over the years. Among these, the - 216G/T (rs712829) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), located in the EGFR promoter region, is gaining attention for its potential clinical relevance. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive chronological overview of the discovery, functional implications, clinical relevance, and broader oncological and non-oncological associations of the EGFR - 216G/T SNP. Relevant studies were identified from 2005 to 2025 through literature searches across publicly available databases and bibliographies of key publications. This SNP was associated to increased EGFR promotor activity, pleural metastasis, susceptibility to EGFR mutations, NSCLC risk, and different inter-individual and inter-ethnic allele frequencies. Conflicting findings regarding survival outcomes and toxicity underscore the need for further validation. Beyond NSCLC, this SNP has demonstrated relevance in colorectal cancer, glioma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and even COVID-19 susceptibility. The - 216G/T polymorphism represents a promising germline biomarker for NSCLC susceptibility. However, population-specific studies and investigations integrating multi-omics data, along with machine learning models are essential to clarify its utility in precision oncology.</p>
