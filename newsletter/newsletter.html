<h2 class="paper-title">Overcoming Resistance in EGFR-Mutant Cancers: A Comprehensive Review of Inhibitor Evolution and SAR-Based Design.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Naykwadi H, Alavala RR.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target in cancer therapy, mainly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Though, the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies is limited by the development of resistance. This comprehensive review details the structural biology of EGFR and its role in oncogenic signaling, elucidating the major activating mutations, particularly exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations, and acquired resistance. The progressive development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), from first-generation ATP-competitive inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib) to third-generation covalent agents (e.g., osimertinib) and emerging fourth-generation allosteric and degradation approaches, are critically examined for their mechanisms, efficacy, and clinical limitations. We have also discussed about the intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms, including alternative oncogenic drivers (KRAS, ALK), bypass pathway activations (MET, HER2), and phenotypic changes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role of computational modeling, high-throughput SAR studies, and preclinical models, including patient-derived xenografts and organoids, in guiding rational drug design. Emerging approaches integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and precision oncology hold potential to accelerate EGFR-targeted drug discovery. The combination strategies with immunotherapy, and anti-angiogenic agents are considered in the context of improving patient outcomes. Together, ongoing advances in understanding EGFR signaling and resistance mechanisms are driving the development of next-generation inhibitors and personalized therapies, with the ultimate goal of overcoming drug resistance and improve patient outcomes in EGFR-mutant cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Precision-Based Filtering Facilitates Integration of Conventional and Single-Nucleus Transcriptomes to Identify Time- and Temperature-Sensitive Cell Populations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Seluzicki, A., Lee, T. A., +3 authors, Chory, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcriptome analysis via RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has become a ubiquitous method of molecular characterization from whole organisms, dissected tissues, and single cells. These experiments have provided an extraordinary volume of data describing the molecular states and responses to many conditions. However, standard approaches to RNAseq analysis commonly use expression level filters that eliminate potentially useful data in the service of decreasing noise. Here we describe the implementation of a coefficient of variation-based filter for RNAseq gene expression data. This filter prioritizes consistent data across replicates, allowing lowly-expressed genes with low-variation measurements to be retained for downstream analysis. We show that, in our Arabidopsis RNAseq data set, this filter allows for the inclusion of many more transcription factors than even a low-stringency expression level filter. We find that these lowly-expressed genes mark specific cell clusters in our single-nucleus (sn)RNAseq dataset. We further characterize communities of co-expressed genes, sampled across the day at two growth temperatures, in relation to snRNAseq cell clusters, finding evidence for a highly photosynthetic cell population, and a cell state marked by high cell division and translation. These methods can be expanded to RNAseq analysis in many systems, facilitating the construction of more detailed models of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DynaPIN: A Tool for Characterizing Dynamic Protein Interfaces</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Barlas, A. B., Ozsan, A., +2 authors, Karaca, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Static structural models often fail to capture the dynamic mechanisms of protein interactions. To address this, we introduce DynaPIN, an open-source pipeline for extracting dynamic interface fingerprints from molecular simulations. DynaPIN unifies quality control metrics, interface prediction accuracy assessment, and atomistic interaction analysis into a single automated workflow, accessible at https://github.com/CSB-KaracaLab/DynaPIN. A key feature is our interface-specific analysis centered on a Dynamic Interface definition, which classifies residues based on the persistence of their interaction status over the simulation. We applied DynaPIN to representative rigid, medium, and difficult targets from the DynaBench dataset, an MD simulation resource for Docking Benchmark 5.5. Our results show that interface flexibility diverges from static accuracy classifications established in Docking Benchmark 5.5, as explored before. All in all, by providing standardized, frame-resolved outputs, DynaPINs aim is to facilitate mechanistic studies and generate standardized unbiased data for future dynamics-aware artificial intelligence models.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Development of a Fluorescent RNA Biosensor for Dual Detection of cGAMP and c-di-GMP Signals in Live Bacteria</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mumbleau, M. M., Hammond, M. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) signaling molecules, such as cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) and 3',3' cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), are second messengers that play critical roles in phenotypic regulation, such as biofilm formation, host colonization, and bacterial virulence. Recently, hybrid promiscuous (Hypr) GGDEF proteins have been identified in certain bacteria to produce both cyclic dinucleotides. One such enzyme, Bd0367, from the predatory Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, switches between synthesizing c-di-GMP and cGAMP to regulate the bacterial predation cycle and prey exit. However, the molecular mechanism controlling this switch remains unknown. Here, we introduce an RNA-based ratiometric, dual metabolite biosensor that enables simultaneous detection of c-di-GMP and cGAMP in live cells. This sensor integrates a Pepper-based biosensor for c-di-GMP detection and a Spinach2-based biosensor for cGAMP detection into a single transcript, producing distinct fluorescent outputs. In E. coli, the dual metabolite sensor reliably reported shifts in c-di-GMP/cGAMP production ratios from various CDN synthases, including Bd0367. Additionally, a histidine kinase was discovered as the probable regulatory partner of Bd0367. These findings demonstrate the sensor's capacity to assess relative CDN levels and to uncover complex signaling pathways. Together, this ratiometric dual metabolite biosensor provides a foundation for broader applications of fluorogenic RNA biosensors in dissecting bacterial signaling networks, microbial ecology, and host-pathogen interactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genome Position Does Not Impact Transgene Expression Efficiency in the Ancient Red Alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Teles, K., Wellman, G. B., +7 authors, Lauersen, K. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The thermoacidophilic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents one of the simplest photosynthetic eukaryotes and an ancient divergent group in the primary endosymbiotic Viridiplantae. Because of its ~16 Mbp genome, containing few introns, and capacity for transgene integration by homologous recombination, it is an emerging chassis for synthetic biology. However, genomic integration sites and scalable transformation methods have not been established to systematically investigate the effect of genome position on transgene expression. Here, we combined bioinformatic genome analysis, liquid-handling robotics, and assays of heterologous protein and metabolite production to establish a reproducible framework for nuclear genome engineering in C. merolae. We mapped and annotated 40 intergenic loci as candidate neutral sites across 16 out of 20 chromosomes and could validate 38 of them through robotic-assisted transformation. Reporter gene expression analysis revealed highly uniform expression at all integration sites across broad populations of transformants, indicating surprising minimal positional effects and transcriptional neutrality. The functional equivalence of these genomic landing pads was determined by expression of a heterologous isoprene synthase, and coupling algal photobioreactors to headspace analysis to quantify isoprene production driven by transgene expression from different integration sites. Single copy transgene integrants, regardless of genome position, exhibited comparable reporter signals and consequent isoprene production. Together, these results provide the first experimentally validated set of neutral integration sites in C. merolae and establish a high-throughput transformation protocol for its genetic engineering in the context of synthetic genome biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Differential adenosine to inosine RNA editing of SINE B2 non-coding RNAs in mouse unveils a novel type of epi-transcriptome response to amyloid beta neuro-toxicity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mitchell, L., Saville, L., +6 authors, Zovoilis, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by early molecular responses to amyloid beta neuro-toxicity that remain poorly defined. RNA editing by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion is a major epitranscriptomic mechanism, yet its contribution to non-coding RNA regulation during neurodegeneration is largely unknown. Short Interspersed Nuclear Element (SINE)-derived RNAs, including mouse B2 RNAs, represent the dominant substrates of A-to-I editing and have recently been shown to regulate gene expression through ribozyme-mediated processing. Here, we introduce and validate a repeat-aware bioinformatics framework that enables position-specific quantification of A-to-I editing within highly repetitive SINE RNAs - an analysis that has been challenging using standard genome-based pipelines. Applying this approach, we uncover discrete editing hotspots in B2 RNAs whose modification is selectively increased during the earliest stages of amyloid beta pathology. Elevated B2 RNA editing is consistently observed across hippocampal or neocortical tissue from two independent mouse models of amyloid beta accumulation and in hippocampal neurons exposed to acute amyloid beta toxicity. Functional perturbation of ADAR activity alters both B2 RNA editing levels and the expression of B2 RNA regulated stress-response genes, directly linking RNA editing to SINE-mediated transcriptional control. Independent validation using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing indicates increased RNA modification signals at the same B2 RNA regions identified by short-read Illumina sequencing. Together, our findings establish a previously unrecognized epitranscriptomic response to amyloid beta neurotoxicity mediated by site-specific A-to-I editing of SINE RNAs. This work defines a new analytical paradigm for studying RNA editing in RNAs from repetitive elements and reveals a regulatory axis connecting amyloid beta toxicity, ADAR activity, SINE RNA editing, and stress-responsive gene expression, with implications for conserved mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Seq2Pocket: Augmenting protein language models for spatially consistent binding site prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Skrhak, V., Polak, L., +1 author, Hoksza, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-ligand binding site prediction (LBS) is important for many domains including computational drug discovery, where, as in other tasks, protein language models (pLMs) have shown a great promise. In their application to LBS, the pLM classifies each amino acid as binding or not. Subsequently, for the purposes of downstream analysis, these predictions are mapped onto the structure, forming structure-continuous pockets. However, their residue-oriented nature often results in spatially fragmented predictions. We present a comprehensive framework (Seq2Pocket) that addresses this by combining finetuned pLM with an embedding-supported smoothing classifier and an optimized clustering strategy. While finetuning on our enhanced scPDB dataset yields state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing predictors by up to 11% in DCC recall, the smoothing classifier restores pocket continuity. Next, we introduce the Pocket Fragmentation Index (PFI) and use it to select a clustering approach that preserves a consistent mapping between predictions and ground-truth pockets. Validated on the LIGYSIS and CryptoBench benchmarks, our approach ensures that pLM-based predictions are not only statistically accurate but also useful for downstream drug discovery, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A distal CTCF-binding site drives MYC expression plasticity in a negative feed-forward loop</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gao, C., Martino, M., +21 authors, Gondor, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oncogene expression heterogeneity systemically diversifies cancer cell phenotypes, enabling selection and cancer evolution. Here we document that the level of MYC expression variation is coordinated by a negative feed-forward loop involving the non-coding CCAT1 eRNA and the MYC gating process. While CCAT1 eRNA indirectly antagonizes MYC gating by promoting MYC transcriptional initiation and elongation, the MYC protein promotes gated MYC expression in a feedback loop by inhibiting both MYC transcription and CCAT1 expression. This entire process is coordinated by a CTCF binding site positioned within CCAT1 at a distal, oncogenic super-enhancer, which functions as a master switch by coordinating both CCAT1 and gated MYC expression to diversify cells toward both low and high MYC levels, as determined by heterogeneity metrics. As hallmarks of this principle are frequent in breast cancer and colorectal tumors, the dynamics of this new principle may underlie transitions between therapy-resistant low-MYC, and proliferative high-MYC tumor cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Gut dysbiosis in oncology: a risk factor for immunoresistance.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Andrew Allan Almonte, Simon Thomas, +3 authors, Laurence Zitvogel</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The gut microbiome is recognized as a determinant of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies in cancer. However, the clinical translation of microbiome science has been hampered by inconsistent definitions of dysbiosis, inadequate biomarker frameworks, and limited mechanistic understanding. In this review, we synthesize the current state of knowledge on how gut microbial composition and function influence ICI efficacy, highlighting both correlative and causal evidence. We discuss computational approaches based on α-diversity or taxonomic abundance and argue for more functionally and clinically informative models, such as the topological score (TOPOSCORE) and other dysbiosis indices derived from machine learning. Using retrospective analyses of metagenomic datasets from thousands of patients and healthy controls, we examine microbial patterns that distinguish responders from non-responders. We also explore how dysbiosis perturbs immunoregulatory pathways, including bile acid metabolism, gut permeability, and mucosal immunomodulation. Finally, we assess emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting microbiome dysfunction - including dietary modification, bacterial consortia, and fecal microbiota transplantation - and describe how they are being deployed in multiple clinical trials. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ONCOBIOME initiative, which works with international partners to incorporate microbiome science into oncology workflows. By refining our understanding of gut-immune interactions and translating it into action, microbiome-informed oncology may unlock new therapeutic potential for patients previously resistant to immunotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Small data, big challenges: Machine- and deep-learning strategies for data-limited drug discovery.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nazreen Pallikkavaliyaveetil, Sriram Chandrasekaran</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A critical bottleneck limiting the potential of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models within the drug discovery and development (DDD) pipeline is the scarcity of high-quality experimental data. Limited data is not an anomaly but an inherent characteristic of the DDD process. Significant financial costs, time, and confidentiality concerns limit the scale of available datasets. Applying standard ML and DL algorithms directly to these small datasets presents substantial challenges. Traditional ML models remain constrained by their dependence on handcrafted features and limited ability to capture complex biological relationships. In contrast, DL algorithms that assume data abundance are prone to overfitting and poor generalization when trained on small datasets. The small data problem thus represents a fundamental constraint that shapes the practical utility and trustworthiness of AI applications in DDD. While prior reviews have surveyed the broad landscape of AI and ML in drug discovery, a significant gap exists concerning the small data challenge across the DDD pipeline. Addressing this challenge requires adapting DL methods that typically assume data abundance, while also extending traditional ML approaches that, although well-suited to small data, remain limited in their representational capacity. This review addresses this gap by surveying key drug discovery tasks, highlighting the prevalence of limited data, and synthesizing both traditional ML methods and advanced DL strategies tailored to these contexts. By integrating methodological advances with task-specific applications, the review outlines current approaches and identifies opportunities for advancing robust, interpretable, and generalizable AI in drug discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transcriptome-wide RNA Stability Across Cancers Reveals Therapeutic Vulnerabilities.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang Tong, Yuting Wang, +5 authors, Qiang Zhang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The steady-state abundance of mRNA is governed by the interplay between transcription and degradation, yet the contribution of RNA stability to cancer biology remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigate RNA decay dynamics across 22 cancer types using RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. By inferring transcriptome-wide RNA stability profiles, we identify distinct molecular subtypes defined by post-transcriptional regulation. Integrative analyses reveal that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), including SNRPA and RBMX, act as key modulators of RNA stability and are essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Somatic mutations, particularly those affecting miRNA binding sites, were found to significantly perturb RNA decay, implicating dysregulation of pathways such as nonsense-mediated decay. Furthermore, machine learning models demonstrate that RNA stability profiles predict sensitivity to 24 anticancer drugs, nominating specific RBPs as candidate biomarkers for therapeutic response. Collectively, our findings establish RNA stability as a pivotal layer of gene regulation in cancer, with broad implications for molecular stratification and precision oncology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omic biomarker detection in ovarian cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qamar Abuhassan, Ghada Al-Assi, M M Rekha, +3 authors, Mehrigul Hayitova</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies, largely because of late-stage diagnosis and the absence of reliable biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic stratification. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled multi-omics approaches that integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics to elucidate the comprehensive molecular landscape of ovarian cancer. This narrative review synthesizes current progress in applying multi-omics strategies to biomarker discovery, highlighting how integrative analyses uncover novel diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive candidates beyond the limitations of single-omics studies. We discuss methodological frameworks, computational pipelines and translational challenges in harmonizing heterogeneous datasets, as well as the potential of systems biology and machine learning to improve biomarker validation. Particular emphasis is placed on the identification of noncoding RNAs, protein signatures, and metabolic alterations as promising biomarker classes. Finally, we outline future directions for clinical implementation, including the development of multiparameter biomarker panels and precision medicine applications. By bridging molecular complexity with translational utility, multi-omics approaches hold transformative potential to advance biomarker identification and improve patient outcomes in ovarian cancer.</p>
