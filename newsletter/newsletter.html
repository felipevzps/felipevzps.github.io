<h2 class="paper-title">fastdemux: Robust SNP-based demultiplexing of single-cell population genomics data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ranjbaran, A., Luca, F., Pique-Regi, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Sample multiplexing reduces cost and batch effects in population based large-scale single-cell genomics studies but requires accurate and scalable computational demultiplexing. Existing genotype-based methods, such as demuxlet, provide high accuracy but can be computationally slow and memory intensive as the number of cells, donors, and informative variants increases. Here, we introduce fastdemux, a scalable genotype-based demultiplexing framework based on a diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) model that substantially improves computational efficiency while maintaining accurate donor assignment. Using a pooled single-cell RNA-seq dataset from unrelated donors, we benchmarked fastdemux against demuxlet, vireo, and demuxalot. fastdemux achieved comparable or improved demultiplexing accuracy while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude relative to alternative methods. Performance remained robust across varying sequencing depths and genotype SNP filtering thresholds. In addition, the DLDA framework naturally extends to doublet and higher-order multiplet detection. We also show that fastdemux works well with scATAC-seq data where genetic variants are more sparsely covered. Together, these results establish fastdemux as an efficient and scalable solution for genetic demultiplexing of pooled single-cell datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A toolkit for programmable transcriptional engineering across eukaryotic kingdoms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ornelas, I. J., Owens, L. A., +6 authors, Nunez, J. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chromatin is essential for eukaryotic life. Tens of thousands of chromatin regulator (CR) proteins exist in eukaryotic genomes that are predicted to modulate chromatin states; however, their molecular functions remain largely untested experimentally. Here, we construct a library of over 300 full-length CRs from humans, plants, yeast, protozoa, and virus, each fused to DNA-binding domains, and test their direct effect on transcriptional repression and activation in plants and human cells. We discover CRs with cross-kingdom functionality when transferred across eukaryotes, including CRs that outperform existing tools for programmable transcriptional repression and activation in plants and human cells. Using pooled CRISPR screens, we demonstrate a suite of CRISPR repressors that titrate gene expression at intermediate levels. Finally, we identify RCOR1 and MTA2 as universal eukaryotic repressors that retain repressive activity in plants, yeast, and human cells. Our toolkit advances synthetic eukaryotic engineering and expands our understanding of CR functionality across eukaryotes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Phylogenetic Structure of β-diversity: Covariance Matrix Sparsification of Critical Beta-splitting Trees</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Svihla, S. P., Lladser, M. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Haar-like wavelets sparsify the phylogenetic covariance matrices of large, uniformly random k-regular trees with overwhelmingly high probability. This motivates the Haar-like distance, a {beta}-diversity metric that implicitly ranks the splits of a reference phylogeny by their relevance in differentiating two microbial environments, offering an interpretation as to why the environments differ compositionally. Nevertheless, uniform binary trees exhibit statistical features distinct from those of the trees used by practitioners, leaving the extent of sparsification and the practical validity of the implied Haar-like distance speculative. To address this, our manuscript examines the sparsification of phylogenetic covariance matrices of large critical beta-splitting random trees, a model introduced to better reflect real-world phylogenies. By obtaining sharp asymptotic estimates of the first and second moments of the external path length in this ensemble, we demonstrate that the Haar-like basis also pseudo-diagonalizes the phylogenetic covariance matrix of most large trees in this more realistic framework. Additionally, we devise a test to assess the statistical significance of splits in the reference phylogeny identified by the Haar-like distance. We apply the test to a well-studied microbial mat to further substantiate the presumption that the identified splits represent genuine biological signals differentiating the top and bottom layers of the mat.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">GeneReL: A Large Language Model-Powered Platform for Gene Regulatory Relationship Extraction with Community Curation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Park, J.-S., Ha, S., +1 author, Kang, Y. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Gene regulatory networks provide fundamental insights into plant biology, yet extracting structured interaction data from scientific literature remains a significant bottleneck. Traditional manual curation cannot scale to meet the demands of modern research, while automated text mining approaches struggle with the complexity of gene nomenclature and relationship classification. Large language models offer promising capabilities for information extraction, but integrated platforms combining LLM extraction with community validation for plant regulatory databases remain scarce. Results: We developed GeneReL, an integrated platform combining LLM-based extraction with community-driven curation for gene regulatory networks in Arabidopsis thaliana. The system employs a tiered pipeline using Claude Haiku 4.5 for screening, Claude Sonnet 4 for extraction, and Claude Opus 4 for verification, along with a novel five-step gene normalization pipeline incorporating paper-text search and LLM-based disambiguation with UniProt annotations. The database contains 13,710 curated interactions across 51 relationship types, with 90.2% classified as high confidence based on linguistic certainty markers in source text. Comparison with IntAct reveals 86.8% of interactions are unique to our literature-derived database, demonstrating complementary coverage to existing resources. The web platform provides card-based browsing with voting capabilities, interactive network visualization using Cytoscape.js with locus-ID-based node consolidation, and administrative interfaces for curator review of ambiguous gene mappings.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SIPdb: A stable isotope probing database and analytical dashboard for linking amplicon sequences to microbial activity using a reverse ecology approach</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Trentin, A. B., Simpson, A., +2 authors, Wilhelm, R. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stable isotope probing (SIP) provides a powerful means to connect microbial sequence data with diverse metabolic activities, but the lack of a framework for SIP-derived data has limited its integration into broader strategies for ecological inference. Here, we introduce the SIPdb, an extensible SQLite database of curated nucleic acid SIP experiments (also in phyloseq format) paired with an interactive RShiny dashboard for analysis and visualization. The initial release compiles 22 studies covering 21 isotopolog substrates across diverse environments, with data standardized using the MISIP metadata standard. In creating the SIPdb, we have provided a standardized pipeline that accommodates the three most common SIP gradient fractionation strategies (binary, multi-fraction, and density-resolved), two isotope incorporator designation strategies (fixed- and sliding-window), and four complementary differential abundance methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, and ALDEx2). Using our pipeline, we identified more than 42,000 unique amplicon sequence variants as isotope incorporators across 62 phyla. Benchmarking with synthetic datasets demonstrated consistent performance across incorporator designation strategies, with ALDEx2 providing the highest specificity. Validation against original publications showed that, on average, SIPdb recovered 70.1% of author-reported incorporator taxa, with discrepancies arising from differences in phylotyping or classification approaches. Finally, our reanalysis of a non-SIP study of 1,4-dioxane degradation showed how SIPdb can both validate known degraders and uncover additional candidate taxa involved in community metabolism. The SIPdb establishes a scalable platform for reverse ecology, enabling hypothesis generation, cross-study meta-analysis, and linking taxa to metabolic processes, while serving as an open, extensible resource to accelerate ecological interpretation in microbiome research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A spectral framework for measuring diversity in multiple sequence alignments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">opuu, v.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine learning (ML) methods for proteins and RNAs rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and related datasets such as experimental mutagenesis libraries, yet the amount of usable information they contain remains unclear. Here, a spectral measure of information is recast into an interpretable quantity for MSAs, denoted Leff, defined as the number of fully independent alignment positions that reproduce the observed sequence diversity. Applied to RNA MSAs, this measure shows that evolutionary constraints nearly halve diversity relative to the secondary structure alone, quantifying functional and phylogenetic restrictions beyond base pairing. The same analysis indicates even lower effective diversity in proteins, quantifying stronger physicochemical and evolutionary constraints on amino acids. Leff further correlates with protein structure prediction accuracy, anticipating cases with insufficient evolutionary signal. When applied to experimentally and computationally generated libraries, it measures both produced diversity and cross-library overlap, quantifying novelty rather than redundant sampling. Together, these results establish Leff as an operational tool to estimate effective information in MSAs, anticipate modeling difficulties, and guide future protein and RNA design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Large-scale quantum computing framework enhances drug discovery in multiple stages</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wen, K., Zha, J., +27 authors, Zhang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Coherent Ising machines (CIMs) excel at solving large-scale combinational optimization problems (COPs), but their insufficient long-term stability has hindered their applications in compute-intensive tasks like computer-aided drug discovery (CADD). By improving fiber vibration isolation and temperature control system, we have implemented a 2000-node CIM named QBoson-CPQC-3Gen achieving stable solutions over one hour on large-scale COPs. Graph-based encoding schemes were further introduced to realize a CIM-based CADD workflow including allosteric site detection, protein-peptide docking and intermolecular similarity calculation. CIM-based methods demonstrated superior speed and accuracy than heuristic algorithms. Especially, QBoson-CPQC-3Gen identified 2 novel druggable sites and bioactive compounds for 6 targets, which were further validated in vitro, in-cell and by crystal structures. Our contributions established a quantum-computing framework for multi-stage drug discovery, representing a significant advancement in both quantum computing applications and pharmaceutical research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metadiffusion: inference-time meta-energy biasing of biomolecular diffusion models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lam, H. Y. I., Pujalte Ojeda, S., +4 authors, Vendruscolo, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomolecular function often depends on conformational ensembles, yet modern diffusion-based structure generators are biased toward the compact conformations prevalent in structural databases, limiting their ability to explore broad conformational landscapes. This work introduces metadiffusion, where an additional meta-energy biasing layer on top of diffusion steers pretrained biomolecular diffusion models through gradient-guided denoising. Without retraining, metadiffusion generates diverse conformational ensembles whose residue-level flexibility patterns closely match molecular dynamics simulations. The method supports three complementary modes: optimisation, steering to user-specified targets, and exploration via inter-sample repulsion. This approach enables controlled exploration of collective variables, enumeration of alternative binding poses across proteins, nucleic acids and ligands, and conformational ensemble generation consistent with SAXS and NMR chemical shifts. Metadiffusion thus provides a practical route to connect diffusion-based structure generation with ensemble-level, experimentally-restrained structural analysis.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Zhong, L., Wang, X., +11 authors, Bian, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Efficient engineering of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is a key strategy for expanding valuable peptide natural products. Current bioinformatics-guided approaches are often constrained by a set of predefined fusion sites, remaining experimentally challenging in most NRPS systems. Here we present the Recombineering Accelerated Evolution (RACE), which harnesses Red/ET recombineering mediated partially matched homologous recombination to recapitulate recombination-driven NRPS evolution on a highly accelerated timescale. Application of RACE to six known NRPS gene clusters generated 830 recombinants and yielded over 600 novel peptides including novel bis-lipopeptides. These recombinants reveal 112 previously unrecognized recombination fusion sites, providing an extensive landscape for NRPS evolution and more useful resources for guiding NRPS engineering. The RACE establishes a new paradigm for programmable NRPS evolution and enables rapid discovery of bioactive peptides.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">X-CODE: a dual RNA barcoding system for multi-platform clonal tracking and spatial phenotyping</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rota, R., Flittner, E., +17 authors, Bezzi, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Experimental dissection of clonal dynamics in complex tissues requires barcoding systems that are scalable, compatible with different analytical platforms, providing phenotypic and spatial resolution. Here we introduce X-CODE, a dual-expressed RNA barcoding system designed to enable high-complexity clonal tracking across sequencing-based, cytometric, and spatial imaging modalities within a unified experimental framework. X-CODE combines a combinatorial, probe-detectable long RNA barcode with a matched short sequencing barcode, enabling seamless integration of probe-based readouts with sequencing and barcode-guided clonal retrieval. We demonstrate robust X-CODE detection by mass cytometry and imaging-based platforms, including spatial RNA barcode readout via a repurposed Akoya PhenoCycler-Fusion protocol. In addition, we show compatibility with MALDI mass spectrometry imaging for co-registration of clonal and metabolic information. We further demonstrate the feasibility of X-CODE detection within probe-based spatial transcriptomics using the 10x Genomics Xenium platform. Applied to an in vivo model of androgen deprivation in prostate cancer, X-CODE reveals clonal architecture, selection and clone-specific phenotypic and metabolic plasticity underlying castration resistance. Together, X-CODE provides a flexible and broadly accessible platform for integrated clonal analysis across spatial, phenotypic, and molecular dimensions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CDK9 pharmacological inhibition with PRT2527 has antitumor activity in marginal zone lymphoma models and can improve the effects of BTK, PI3K, and BCL2 inhibitors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cannas, E., Arribas, A. J., +6 authors, Bertoni, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) drives transcriptional elongation and supports the expression of short-lived oncogenic and anti-apoptotic proteins such as MYC and MCL1. PRT2527 is a potent, selective CDK9 inhibitor currently in early clinical development. We evaluated its preclinical activity in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) models, including cell lines with acquired resistance to BTK, PI3K, and BCL2 inhibitors. Short exposure (4 hours) to PRT2527 produced nanomolar cytotoxicity across all tested MZL cell lines, with efficacy maintained in resistant derivatives. Transcriptomic profiling of VL51 cells showed broad gene repression, including MYC, IRF4, NF-{kappa}B-related genes, and MCL1, alongside increased expression of HLA class II genes. Moreover, comparison with additional CDK inhibitors revealed a similar transcriptional repression signature, underscoring a conserved CDK-dependent regulatory network. Protein analyses confirmed rapid depletion of MCL1, MYC, RNA polymerase II, and IRF4. Flow cytometry validated increased HLA class II and decreased HLA class I surface expression. Combination studies demonstrated additive to synergistic effects with BTK inhibition (ibrutinib) or dual PI3K/BCL2 inhibition (copanlisib plus venetoclax), independent of baseline drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, these combinations may enhance apoptosis by concurrently suppressing survival signaling and transcriptional addiction. Analysis of patient samples revealed high CDK9 expression, further supporting the biological relevance and therapeutic rationale for targeting CDK9 in this disease. Our findings support the development of CDK9-based combination strategies for relapsed/refractory MZL and other B-cell malignancies, with an additional potential for integration with immunotherapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MAPK ERK5 Is a Novel Regulator of MHC-I in Cancer Cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vinas-Casas, M., Lizcano, J. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules is a frequent mechanism of tumor immune evasion, impairing recognition and elimination of cancer cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. This phenotype, associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, is often driven by oncogenic pathways that reversibly suppress MHC-I. The MAPK ERK5 and its only upstream activating kinase MEK5 configure a unique intracellular signaling that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, and it has emerged as an oncogenic driver of different tumors. In this work, we investigated whether the ERK5 pathway contributes to cellular immunity. We used a panel of human cancer cell lines representing three well-established oncogenic contexts linked to reversible MHC-I downregulation (MYCN amplification, PTEN/PIK3CA mutations, and androgen receptor signaling), together with control cellular models exhibiting constitutively high MHC-I expression. We found that MEK5 or ERK5 pharmacologic inhibition or ERK5 targeted degradation increased MHC-I surface and total expression in low MHC-I cells, without affecting PD-L1 levels. Conversely, ERK5 overexpression impaired MHC-I levels. Moreover, systemic administration of an ERK5 inhibitor also enhanced MHC-I expression in tumor xenografts. Mechanistically, RT-qPCR analysis showed that ERK5 or MEK5 inhibition did not significantly modify transcription of classical HLA-I genes or antigen-processing machinery components, and RNA-seq analysis did not render enrichment of MHC-I transcriptional programs in response to ERK5 inhibition. In contrast, trafficking experiments implicated the ERK5 pathway in the regulation of MHC-I lysosomal degradation, suggesting that ERK5 controls surface MHC-I through post-translational mechanisms. Notably, functional assays were carried out in co-cultures of cancer cells with tumor-specific human CD8+ T cells, where ERK5 inhibition sensitized MYCN-amplified or PTEN/PI3KCA-mutated cancer cells to CD8+ T cell-mediated apoptosis. These results identify ERK5 as a novel regulator of MHC-I expression in cancer cells, by regulating antigen presentation across diverse oncogenic contexts, and support a rationale for the use of ERK5 inhibitors as a strategy to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Diet-induced macrophage-driven inflammation fuels pancreatic plasticity and aggressiveness</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Galvan-del-Rey, A., Lopez-Gil, J. C., +22 authors, Guerra, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High fat diet (HFD) and obesity are increasingly recognized as risk factors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet the mechanisms by which dietary fat contribute to oncogenic transformation remain elusive. Using an inducible acinar specific KrasG12V/Trp53 loss genetically-engineered mouse model of PDAC, we established early and late onset protocols to assess age dependent susceptibility to HFD. Specifically, HFD accelerated tumorigenesis with poorer prognosis in early onset mice and, strikingly, enabled full PDAC development in late onset adult mice otherwise resistant to oncogenic transformation. Tumors arising under HFD activated a distinct transcriptional and epigenetic state enriched in pathways or genes related to stemness, plasticity, and metastatic competence, which was maintained even in tumor-derived cell lines. Mechanistically, fatty acid educated macrophages secreted the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), activating P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2RX7) signaling in tumor cells to drive a highly plastic, immune evasive phenotype reinforced by the expression of the peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), further shielding tumor cells from macrophage phagocytosis. Functionally, HFD induced tumors displayed enhanced metastatic potential independent of host context. Analysis of 164 human PDAC samples revealed that elevated body-mass index (BMI) was associated to a conserved CAMP-P2RX7-CXCR4 signature, maintained despite weight loss during disease progression. Together, these findings uncover a diet imprinted macrophage-tumor cell circuit that promotes transformation and accelerates PDAC progression, positioning it as a therapeutic vulnerability in obesity associated pancreatic cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biomedical Data Manifest: A lightweight data documentation mapping to increase transparency for AI/ML.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Daniel Bottomly, Christopher G Suciu, +6 authors, Shannon K McWeeney</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical machine learning (ML) models raise critical concerns about embedded assumptions influencing clinical decision-making, necessitating robust documentation frameworks for datasets that are shared via external repositories. Fairness-aware algorithm effectiveness hinges on users' prior awareness of specific issues in the data - information such as data collection methodology, provenance and quality. Current ML-focused documentation approaches impose impractical burdens on data generators and conflate data/model accountability. This is problematic for resource datasets not explicitly created for ML applications. This study addresses these gaps through a two-step process: First, we derived consensus documentation fields by mapping elements across four key templates. Second, we surveyed biomedical stakeholders across four roles (clinicians, bench scientists, data manager and computationalists) to assess field importance and relevance. This revealed important role-dependent prioritization differences, motivating the development of the Biomedical Data Manifest - a modular template employing persona-specific field presentation reducing generator burden while ensuring end-users receive role-relevant information. The Biomedical Data Manifest improves transparency for datasets deposited in public or controlled-access repositories and bias mitigation across ML applications.</p>
