<h2 class="paper-title">A scalable transposon mutagenesis system for non-model bacteria</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gilbert, C., Leung, J., +10 authors, Ostrov, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transposon mutagenesis enables genome-wide interrogation of gene function with a single self-contained genetic construct. However, its application to non-model bacteria remains limited because transposition efficiency depends on multiple host factors that are difficult to predict a priori including transposase activity, antibiotic resistance marker performance, and regulatory element compatibility. Here, we present a scalable system to identify functional transposon configurations in non-model bacteria through pooled library screening. We selected 18 promoters across multiple bacterial phyla to independently drive expression of the transposase and antibiotic resistance marker, generating 324 promoter combinatorial variants for each of six antibiotic resistance markers. We developed a high-throughput, automated workflow to deliver all 1,944 mariner-based transposon variants in a single experiment and applied this to 92 non-model bacteria spanning multiple phyla. From this, we identified functional transposons for 43 strains, with high-level mutagenesis (102-104 unique insertions) in 13 species, including seven with no previously described transposon mutagenesis. We then expanded to a dual-transposase system, mariner or Tn5, and devised a single transposon insertion sequencing method for high-throughput screening of 3,888 configurations. To demonstrate the practical utility of our screening approach, we used a top-performing variant to generate a genome-wide transposon mutant library for Comamonas testosteroni KF-1, a bacterium that metabolizes plastic- and lignin-derived polymers. We assayed this C. testosteroni mutant library to identify enzymatic pathways, transporter genes, and regulators essential for the metabolism of plastics-associated monomer terephthalate and lignin-associated monomer 4-hydroxybenzoate. Together, this work establishes a scalable approach to construct and identify genetic perturbation systems in non-model bacteria, expanding our ability to systematically probe gene function across the bacterial tree of life.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Coiled-coil scaffolds for Targeted Protein Degradation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Korona, B., Mylemans, B., +5 authors, Itzhaki, L. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In targeted protein degradation (TPD) the cell's quality control machinery is co-opted to degrade proteins of interest. Currently TPD is limited by the availability of small-molecule binders for targets and the many potential human E3 ubiquitin ligases. Consequently, other approaches are needed to tackle new targets and to exploit degradation pathways fully. The natural binding epitopes for E3s and other degradation machineries are often short linear peptide motifs, which offer routes to new biologics-based degraders. Here, targeting the anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and initiation of apoptosis, we show that several protein-degradation pathways - ubiquitination, direct proteasome, autophagy-lysosome recruitment - can be leveraged by integrating target-binding and degradation motifs into single-polypeptide constructs. This exploits versatile and varied de novo coiled-coil scaffolds as adaptable molecular glues by presenting motifs multivalently and in diverse arrangements. The constructs are small (~80 residues) and provide a plug-and-play platform to map and optimise target-degradation space using rational design. We call this Coiled Coils for induced Proximity (CoCoProx) and propose its use for targeted degradation and other induced-proximity reactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Demonstrating and engineering the de novo synthesis of two aromatic chemicals estragole and anethole in Escherichia coli</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lv, Y., Ding, S., +8 authors, Xu, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Estragole and anethole are the major flavoring and aroma components of the essential oils extracted from basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), anise (Pimpinella anisum), star anise (Illicium verum), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare). Besides, they also exhibit bioactivities, such as antioxidation, antimicrobial, immunomodulation, inti-inflammation, and anti-diabetes. These properties make them being faced with substantial applications in the industries of food, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and agriculture. Commercial estragole and anethole are currently obtained from extraction from their original plants, which suffers from unstable quality and resources. Microbial synthesis is a promising alternative approach to sustainably obtain estragole and anethole, but has not been achieved. In this study, we modularly redesigned the synthetic pathways based on the Escherichia coli chassis. Firstly, a p-coumaryl alcohol over-accumulator (436.28 mg/L) was engineered to facilitate the validation of the undemonstrated downstream module. De novo biosynthesis of estragole and anethole was achieved by stepwise analysis and BioBricks assembly. The intracellular availability of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) was revealed to be the key limiting factor, and was enhanced by deregulating the synthesis. Finally, the productions of estragole and anethole were improved by 246.88% and 202.44% compared with the initial strains. This study represents the first synthesis of estragole and anethole in microbial chassis, and the demonstration of microbial synthesis of propenyl phenols. Besides, it provided an alternative sustainable approach to obtain flavoring and aroma chemicals.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MONDE·T: A Database and Interactive Webserver for Non-Canonical Amino Acids (ncAAs) in the PDB</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Waldherr, A., Freimann, G. L., Lupas, A. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Summary. Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are understood as amino acids that are not genetically encoded. They are of wide interest for protein design and applications in pharmaceutical and cell biological research, but their impact on protein structure has not been explored systematically. We therefore collected all ncAAs in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into the MONDE{middle dot}T database, amounting to 1,875 different chemical types in &gt;10,000 entries. They are made accessible through a webserver that allows for data download, visualization of the structures in which they occur, plots of their backbone torsion angles compared to canonical residues, and exploration of their similarity to these. Analyses can focus on a single ncAA or a specific protein structure, illustrated here by example applications. Availability and implementation. MONDE{middle dot}T is hosted at the Max Planck Institute for Biology Tubingen, accessible online at https://mondet.tuebingen.mpg.de.

<h2 class="paper-title">SurfDiff: protein surface profiling for selective or broadly reactive epitope prioritisation in binder and immunogen design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jedlitzke, B., Wissett, O., +2 authors, Sormanni, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rational selection of protein-surface patches - epitopes or ligandable sites - is essential for developing targeted antibodies, binding proteins, peptides, or small-molecule ligands, and for informing immunogen design in vaccines. We present SurfDiff, a structure- and sequence-informed framework for protein surface comparison. SurfDiff supports one-to-one and one-to-many comparisons by combining local structural alignments with physicochemically and spatially aware neighbourhood analysis. It assigns residue-level uniqueness and similarity scores, which can be aggregated into surface-level similarity, selectivity, and a discriminability score that captures conservation across desired targets while penalising similarity to undesired off-targets. These scores, calculated solely from the targets without any knowledge of the binders, reliably predict known experimental selectivity for diverse binders including small molecules, peptides, antibodies and antibody mimetics across viral antigens, cytokine isoforms, GPCR subtypes and serum albumin. They also correlate strongly with binding and neutralisation data across pathogen variants, and substantially outperform commonly used bioinformatic metrics such as sequence substitution matrices and structural similarity measures. SurfDiff provides a generalisable and interpretable approach to protein surface profiling, enabling selective or cross-reactive binder design, cross-species prioritisation, and facilitating immunogen selection. We make SurfDiff available as downloadable open-source software: (https://gitlab.developers.cam.ac.uk/ch/sormanni/surfdiff) and as a webserver: www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/surfdiff.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Defining bottlenecks and physiological impact of an orthogonal translation initiation system</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Scopelliti, D., Vincent, R. M., +5 authors, Jaschke, P. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reengineering translation initiation provides a powerful route to develop new translation systems that enable precise control of protein synthesis. While many engineered translation systems show promise, their orthogonality and impact on host physiology is largely uncharacterized, limiting broader application. Here, we develop an initiator-tRNA with an AAC anticodon mutation (i-tRNA-AAC), enabling translation initiation at a GUU start codon. Using fluorescence assays, proteomics, and tRNA sequencing, we assess the i-tRNA-AAC initiation orthogonality and effects on the host, guiding the optimization of its translational efficiency. We find the i-tRNA-AAC mutant initiates translation exclusively from its GUU start codon and is improved by overexpression of valyl-tRNA synthetase and methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase. However, this intervention perturbs aminoacylation and base modifications of endogenous tRNAs along with proteome-wide changes likely due to increased valine demand. Our findings demonstrate how an orthogonal translation initiation system reshapes host physiology and reveals the adaptive responses that accompany translational reprogramming.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimal Maturation Protocols for High-Affinity Antibody Targets: A Path-Integral Approach</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Huot, M., Molari, M., +1 author, Cocco, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Affinity maturation is a stochastic evolutionary process allowing the adaptive immune system to produce B-cells capable of recognizing antigenic molecules. One of the main factors influencing the quality of the maturation outcome, quantified by the affinity of the produced antibodies to the antigen, is the time-course of antigen availability. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic model for affinity maturation, calibrated against in vivo lineage dynamics and deep mutational scanning data, and address the following question: what is the best antigen-concentration protocol maximizing the probability to reach a target affinity value at the end of the process? We introduce a path-integral formalism to identify the maturation trajectories of the rare clones ending at the desired target affinity, estimate their probabilities, and maximize them over the antigen-concentration temporal profile. The theoretical optimal concentration protocol is approximated by a discrete three-injection schedule; we show that such temporal modulation of selection pressure outperforms constant-dosage regimes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An accurate phasing tool via high-quality heterozygous variations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, J., Nie, F., Wang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long-read phasing has become a widely adopted approach for reconstructing paternal and maternal haplotypes in diploid genomes. However, most existing phasing methods treat all variants equally, even though low-quality variants frequently introduce switch errors. We present a new phasing method, snpphaser, which first phases high-quality variants and then leverages them to filter out low-quality variants that are inconsistent with the high-confidence haplotypes. We benchmarked snpphaser against state-of-the-art phasing methods across nine diverse datasets. The results demonstrate that snpphaser achieves superior contiguity and accuracy compared to existing approaches.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Computational array reconstruction for spatial transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Oakes, C. G., Pachter, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Several optics-free spatial transcriptomics assays that make use of diffusion of reads from beads have recently been developed, and provide a proof of principle for high-throughput, untargeted, spatial transcriptomics. These approaches leads to a challenging computational array reconstruction problem. We show that a statistical inference method, which we term accumap, outperforms the current approach which is to run UMAP on the bead count matrix. The accumap method makes use of predicted distances to reconstruct bead positions and can improve the accuracy of reconstruction by a factor of 3 in the diffusible Slide-Tag simulation framework.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multiplexed Pan Soluble Ligandome Assaying via OASIS</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lee, Y.-H., Doctor, Y., +4 authors, Mali, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Screening soluble protein ligands is essential for understanding signaling interactions and enabling drug discovery. Currently, screens require arrayed formats because ligand diffusibility causes non-cell-autonomous effects. To enable multiplexed pooled assaying, we developed Obligate Autocrine Signaling In situ Screening (OASIS). Using lentiviral delivery of genetically barcoded ligands fused to a tethering domain, we anchor proteins to the expressing cell's outer membrane, exclusively enforcing autocrine signaling. Validation using IFNA2 and EGF demonstrated uncompromised autocrine signaling with significantly reduced paracrine activity. We leveraged OASIS to perform a pan-ligandome fitness screen of all 770 validated human ligands in KOLF2.1J hiPSCs, identifying potent self-renewal factors, including FGF family ligands, which we experimentally validated in soluble form. Finally, we performed single-cell Perturb-Seq to map the transcriptional remodeling induced by the pan-ligandome library. OASIS provides a generalizable framework to accelerate functional interrogation of the human ligandome and novel peptide binders within live cells and diverse lineages.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Sullivan, J., Huang, H., +9 authors, Fleischman, A. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tobacco and nicotine use remain the leading preventable drivers of cancer risk, and both direct and secondhand exposure to combustible cigarettes or electronic nicotine devices perturbs immune function and hematopoiesis. Here, we evaluate the impact of e-cigarette vapor and combustible cigarette smoke on in vitro cell inflammatory responses and in vivo long-term hematopoietic differentiation. In cell-based studies, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and e-cigarette vapor extract (EVE) consistently suppress LPS-induced TNF- secretion across macrophage/monocyte models, including primary mouse and human cells and complementary cell lines, indicating a reproducible immunosuppressive effect on mature myeloid cells. Brief ex vivo exposure to CSE also alters myeloid subset composition and modifies the proliferative behavior of Tet2-knockout cells, suggesting that smoke-related cues can reshape competitive dynamics among mutant and wild-type myeloid progenitors. To assess consequences of smoking behavior in vivo, we used a custom nose-cone inhalation system to deliver controlled exposures to combustible cigarette smoke or e-cigarette aerosol to mice. Chronic exposure increased myeloid proliferation, consistent with smoking behavior inducing premature aging of the hematopoietic stem cell pool. Thus, these studies support a model in which tobacco exposures blunt innate immune responsiveness while simultaneously driving myeloid expansion conditions that accelerate hematopoietic aging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Revealing the Drivers Underlying Distinct Evolutionary Trajectories in Lung Adenocarcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wirth, C., Zhang, T., +41 authors, Liu, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Elucidating the evolution of cancers allows us to understand their key events, and the order in which they occur. To chart and interpret these evolutionary trajectories, we leverage whole-genome sequencing of lung tumours, including those from the largest cohort to date of lung cancers in subjects who have never smoked. Through ordering frequent genomic alterations, we discover three distinct evolutionary paths taken by lung adenocarcinomas; two dominated by tumours from people who have never smoked (NS-LUAD), and one followed by the vast majority of those who have smoked (S-LUAD). However, one in six NS-LUAD follow the smoking-dominant trajectory. These tumours, surprisingly, have fewer somatic alterations than the other NS-LUAD, and have shorter latency. They are strongly enriched for KRAS mutations. Our results suggest that gaining KRAS mutations allows these tumours to evolve more rapidly, acquiring a set of smoking-associated key alterations, with less need for genomic instability to progress. These tumours are three times more frequent in subjects of European vs. East Asian ancestry. These findings could shape clinical management strategies for lung adenocarcinoma patients, particularly for tumours driven by smoking-like evolutionary trajectories.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A dietary pan-amino acid dropout screen in vivo reveals a critical role for histidine in T-ALL</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mandleywala, K., Ulrich, S., da Silva-Diz, V., +16 authors, Herranz, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dietary interventions show therapeutic potential in cancer, but systematic comparisons are lacking. We performed a dietary pan-amino acid dropout screen in an orthotopic model of NOTCH1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and identified histidine depletion as uniquely antileukemic. Histidine-restricted diets extended survival of leukemic mice in a dose-dependent manner, while remaining well-tolerated. Mechanistically, multiomic profiling revealed that histidine deprivation-induced ribosome stalling activates GCN2 to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis pathways critical for leukemic proliferation. Dietary cholesterol supplementation partially reverted the antileukemic effects of histidine restriction in vivo. These findings couple histidine levels and translational control to cholesterol metabolism, which can be therapeutically exploited for cancer treatment. Our results suggest that defined dietary amino acid restrictions may expose broader therapeutic opportunities in diseases beyond cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Redefining the topology of the human bone marrow using augmented spatial transcriptomic analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cooper, R., Thomas, E., +13 authors, Royston, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The bone marrow (BM) is the main site of haematopoiesis in adult life. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of BM-derived blood cancers is limited by lack of spatial contextualisation. While emerging spatial transcriptomic (ST) platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for spatially-resolved cellular phenotyping, we recognise and incorporate the power of AI-based tissue feature detection to enhance ST workflows. We perform ST analysis to define the topology of the normal bone marrow (BM) and BM in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), profiling 5,104,452 cells across 30 human BM samples. Following rigorous histology-based QC, we identify spatially-restricted trajectories of haematopoiesis and extend our understanding of the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. We find that BM fibrosis in MPN is associated with expansion of distinct immune and stromal co-enriched cell neighbourhoods. We then present a machine learning (ML)-based model trained on ST data that quantifies BM microenvironmental deviation, identifying heretofore unrecognised inter- and intra-individual sample heterogeneity in MPN. Our study demonstrates the potential for AI-based augmented ST analysis, and redefines our understanding of human BM topology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantum implementation of multi-pattern string matching for k-mer detection</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Papalitsas, C., Mouratidis, I., +3 authors, Koulouras, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: The exponential growth of publicly available genomic data has created unprecedented opportunities for sequence-based discovery. Locating specific k-mers is fundamental to diverse applications, including metagenomic classification, pathogen and cancer detection, and variant calling yet efficient identification of multiple k-mer patterns across large sequencing data and massive databases remains a significant computational challenge. Method: We implement two quantum algorithms for DNA multi pattern string matching for k-mer detection based on Grover's amplitude amplification with quantum random access memory (QRAM). The first algorithm uses an enumerate-m oracle that sequentially checks a loaded text substring against all m patterns achieving O({surd}S) query complexity for S text positions but requiring O(mxL) work per oracle call. The second algorithm employs nested Grover search with an outer loop over text positions and an inner loop over pattern space, reducing oracle complexity to O(L) while performing O({surd}Sx{surd}m) in total. Results: We present two quantum implementations of multi-pattern string matching tailored for k-mer detection. Leveraging quantum parallelism and Grover-inspired search primitives, our methods accelerate dictionary-based pattern matching, particularly in contexts involving large sequences, such as genomic data, and extensive pattern sets. Conclusions: While implementation challenges such as QRAM overhead remain, this study demonstrates both the promise and current limitations of quantum-enhanced string matching, establishing a foundational step toward quantum readiness in bioinformatics.</p>
