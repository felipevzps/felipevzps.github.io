<h2 class="paper-title">NanoporeDB: A Structural Resource Of Multimeric Protein Nanopores In Single-Molecule Sensing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Y., Su, Z., +12 authors, Wang, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein nanopores are essential molecular gateways in biology and have inspired transformative technologies in biosensing and single-molecule sequencing. While this technology has transformed genomics and biosensing, the discovery of novel nanopore scaffolds remains limited due to the scarcity of experimentally resolved pore structures. Here, we present NanoporeDB, an open-access structural resource comprising over 6,600 high-confidence multimeric models across four representative pore types. Candidate proteins were systematically mined from large-scale datasets, including the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, UniRef90, and MGnify90, and assembled using AlphaFold-Multimer and AlphaFold3. We performed membrane embedding, pore axis annotation, and constriction profiling to enable functional interpretation. NanoporeDB features an interactive web interface with 3D visualization and quantitative metrics such as insertion depth, tilt angle, and pore geometry. This resource provides a structural foundation for advancing nanopore-based molecular sensing, precision diagnostics, and synthetic biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ovo, an Open-Source Ecosystem for De Novo Protein Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Prihoda, D., Ancona, M., +5 authors, Bitton, D. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The protein design field is rapidly advancing, with frequent emergence of new models and pipelines for designing de novo proteins with tailored properties and functions not found in nature. However, the current tool landscape is fragmented, tools are hard to install and deploy, and require significant computational expertise to integrate into end-to-end, scalable pipelines. A particular challenge is managing many sequences, structures, and metrics for downstream testing and retrospective analysis of input parameters. To address this need, we introduce Ovo, an open-source de novo protein design ecosystem that consolidates models, workflows, data management, and interactive visualization into a scalable, infrastructure-agnostic platform. Ovo features Nextflow-based workflow orchestration, a storage layer, and both command-line and graphical interfaces that democratize scaffold design, binder design and diversification, and validation workflows. Ovo's novel ProteinQC module computes comprehensive sequence and structure descriptors, contextualizing designs against reference sets. Ovo plugins let the community add new workflows and user interfaces to accelerate adoption of emerging methods and facilitate community-driven benchmarking. Ovo lowers engineering barriers and demystifies the design process, allowing experts and non-technical users to design proteins at scale. With community-driven development, Ovo can accelerate de novo protein design and advance discovery in therapeutics and biotechnology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep-learning model guided discovery and characterization of bacterial unspecific peroxygenases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shen, X., Song, D., +2 authors, Chen, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are capable of catalyzing the selective oxidation of organic substrates under mild conditions, using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the sole oxidant. This makes them one of the most promising biocatalysts for chemical synthesis. However, the major limitation restricting the application of UPOs to date is their difficulty in heterologous expression. Although more than 4,000 putative UPO enzymes have been recorded in databases, only about 50 of them can currently be heterologously expressed. All UPOs discovered so far originate from eukaryotes (mainly basidiomycetes and some ascomycetes), and they rely on the complex expression systems and post-translational modifications of their native hosts. This further exacerbates the challenges associated with heterologous expression of eukaryotic UPOs. In this work, we developed a deep-learning-based enzyme mining strategy and, for the first time, discovered novel UPO enzymes from bacteria, achieving successful heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Bacterial UPOs differ greatly from fungal UPOs in sequence similarity, displaying completely distinct evolutionary trajectories. The discovery of bacterial UPOs advances our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and expression characteristics within the UPO family, breaking the long-held assumption that UPOs can only originate from eukaryotes. Their excellent heterologous expression performance and broad catalytic versatility will further expand the application potential of UPOs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineered symbiont biosensor maps micron-scale sugar gradients in the honeybee gut</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chhun, A., Quinn, A., +4 authors, Schaerli, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The honeybee gut microbiota plays a key role in shaping host health and susceptibility to disease. Yet, the nutrient environment it experiences within the gut remains poorly characterized. In particular, little is known about the spatial distribution of nutrients across this community, as resolving such fine gradients in vivo has been technically challenging. Here, we engineer the native honeybee symbiont Snodgrassella alvi as a living biosensor to quantify the bioavailability of the dietary sugar arabinose within the gut. By expanding the genetic toolkit for S. alvi through chromosomal integration of high-burden genes and a suite of low-strength promoters, we achieve stable multi-gene expression without compromising host colonization. The resulting biosensor generates a specific, dose-dependent response to arabinose in situ, enabling visualization of sugar gradients across gut-associated bacterial biofilms at micron-scale resolution. Using this system, we show that diet-derived arabinose distribution is highly heterogeneous and can be influenced by the metabolic activity of co-colonizing Gilliamella species. These findings highlight how diet composition and microbial specialization generate fine-scale microenvironments within the gut. More broadly, this work further establishes S. alvi as a genetically tractable platform for in situ probing of microbial metabolism and nutrient distribution.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rewriting protein alphabets with language models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pantolini, L., Studer, G., +7 authors, Durairaj, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Detecting remote homology with speed and sensitivity is crucial for tasks like function annotation and structure prediction. We introduce a novel approach using contrastive learning to convert protein language model embeddings into a new 20-letter alphabet, TEA, enabling highly efficient large-scale protein homology searches. Searching with our alphabet performs on par with and complements structure-based methods without requiring any structural information, and with the speed of sequence search. Ultimately, we bring the exciting advances in protein language model representation learning to the plethora of sequence bioinformatics algorithms developed over the past century, offering a powerful new tool for biological discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fine-Tuning Protein Language Models Enhances the Identification and Interpretation of the Transcription Factors</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hassan, M. T., Gaffar, S., +1 author, Lee, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal regulators of gene expression and play essential roles in diverse cellular activities. The three-dimensional organization of the genome and transcriptional regulation are predominantly orchestrated by TFs. By recruiting the transcriptional machinery to gene enhancers or promoters, TFs can either activate or repress transcription, thereby controlling gene activity and various biological pathways. Accurate identification of TFs is vital for elucidating gene regulatory mechanisms within cells. However, experimental identification remains labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the necessity for efficient computational approaches. In this study, we present a two-layer predictive framework utilizing protein language models (pLMs) via full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The initial layer robustly classifies and identifies transcription factors, while the subsequent layer predicts TFs with a binding preference for methylated DNA (TFPMs). Our approach further incorporates attention weights and protein sequence motifs to enhance interpretability and predictive capability. By leveraging attention mechanisms, we highlight biologically relevant regions of the protein sequences that contribute most strongly to the predictions. Additionally, motif analysis facilitates the identification of conserved sequence patterns that are critical for TF recognition and function. Across both TF and TFPM classification tasks, the inclusion of these features allowed our methods to consistently surpass contemporary models, as demonstrated by independent test results.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Transcriptional Profiling and Co-expression Integration for the Filtering of Relevant Bacterial sRNA-mRNA Interactions: Application to Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ribeiro, C. A. M., Quispe Saji, G. d. R., +6 authors, Nicolas, M. F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are fast-acting non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), stress-responsive regulators that fine-tune bacterial gene expression, shaping virulence, antimicrobial resistance, metabolism, and biofilm development. At the post-transcriptional level, sRNAs pair with target mRNAs to block or enhance translation, remodel secondary structures, adjust transcript stability, and act as molecular sponges for other sRNAs. Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, relies on a multiple-layered regulatory network, including post-transcriptional mechanisms, to transition between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Here, we expand the cross-lineage sRNA repertoire of S. aureus by integrating newly generated RNA-seq data from the Brazilian ST239 Bmb9393 strain with public datasets from five USA-lineage strains previously uncharacterized for sRNAs. Using sequence homology and covariance models, we predicted and annotated candidate sRNA loci across all analyzed genomes, quantified their expression under planktonic and biofilm conditions, and assigned genomic context. Integration of differential-expression (DE) profiles with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified sRNAs associated with biofilm and virulence, in modules that include well-known regulators (sarA, mgrA, RNAIII) and the adhesin clfA. To prioritize functional target interactions, we combined DEG concordance, network features, and interaction-energy thresholds, depleting millions of initial predictions to thousands of high-confidence sRNA-mRNA pairs. Our integrative bioinformatics framework provides additional insights into sRNA-mediated regulation in S. aureus, highlighting biofilm- and resistance-linked candidates, and yields a ranked, reusable set of sRNA-mRNA interactions to guide hypothesis-driven experiments across diverse genetic backgrounds.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Clinical Implications of SRPK1 Expression in Human Tumours: A Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis Based on Multi-Omics Databases</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Duzgun, D., Oltean, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), which primarily regulates alternative splicing (AS), has been implicated in various malignancies. However, the comprehensive expression landscape and clinical relevance of SRPK1 across diverse tumour types have not been systematically investigated. Chemoresistance remains a formidable obstacle in cancer treatment, accounting for nearly 90% of treatment failures and leading to poor patient survival. Aberrant AS, often driven by splicing factors like SRPK1, is a mechanism cancer cells exploit to overcome chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. With that, this study tested the hypothesis of tumour-specific alterations in SRPK1 expression as novel therapeutic targets through a pan-cancer analysis of SRPK1 using multi-omics data, obtained from public databases, including TCGA, CPTAC, GEPIA2, and drug sensitivity platforms. The analysis specifically assessed the pan-cancer expression landscape of SRPK1 at the mRNA and protein levels and its prognostic implications across different cancer types (breast, colon, and prostate cancers), functional analysis of SRPK1-associated splicing network, and its expression in correlation with predicted drug sensitivity. The results revealed the correlations of high SRPK1 expression with worse overall and disease-free survival in a cancer-specific manner and resistance to standard-of-care agents like cisplatin and docetaxel. The integrative multi-omics approach in this study provided a robust foundation for understanding the complex, multifaceted role of SRPK1 in tumour-specific chemoresistance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Proteostasis Modelling using Deuterated Water Metabolic Labeling and Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Deberneh, H. M., Wilkinson, D. J., +4 authors, Sadygov, R. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present the first application of a deuterated water metabolic labeling workflow coupled with data-independent acquisition (DIA) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for quantifying label enrichment in MS/MS to study protein turnover. The approach automates the turnover rate determination from combined precursor and fragment ions. The truncation of the observed isotope distributions of fragments is overcome by implementing an approach to determining the label enrichment from two mass isotopomers. The high redundancy of fragment ions provides a confident assessment for deuterium enrichment. The DIA approach provides increased proteome coverage and depth for quantifying protein turnover rates compared to the traditional data-dependent (DDA) approach. This novel approach is validated in a murine myotube model of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy through the treatment with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and dexamethasone (Dex), respectively.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mammary Fibroblasts Secrete Damage Associated Molecular Patterns through Extracellular Vesicles in Response to Ionizing Radiation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sanchez, G. B., Patel, P., +3 authors, Rafat, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ionizing radiation (IR) is an integral component of cancer therapy. Cellular exposure to IR typically leads to major biological consequences including cell death and senescence. Furthermore, tissue injury in known to involve the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space, which trigger inflammation and wound healing. However, DAMP release in the context of radiation injury remains to be fully characterized. Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion and associated cargo components are part of the cellular response to IR, but the mechanisms integrating cellular damage and EV secretion post-IR are largely unexplored. In this study, we show that acute IR-induced damage in mammary fibroblasts results in a senescence-like phenotype and substantially increased EV secretion. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that IR-induced EVs are enriched with extracellular and intracellular DAMPs, along with other pro-inflammatory mediators. We show that knockdown of the GTPase Rab27a abrogates IR-induced EV secretion and inhibits the enrichment of key DAMPs in EVs. By examining the integration of cellular damage and senescence with the release of inflammatory signals, this study elucidates a potentially critical role for EV-associated proteins in the radiation response.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evaluation of single-cell RNA profiling technologies using FFPE, fresh, and frozen ccRCC tumor specimens</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xirenayi, S., Camp, S. Y., +11 authors, Van Allen, E. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The application of single-cell transcriptomic approaches has deepened our understanding of tumor heterogeneity, immune dynamics, and molecular programs underlying therapy response. The recent development of fixation-compatible single-cell platforms, such as 10x Genomics Flex, offers the opportunity to profile archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, expanding access to clinically valuable samples. However, most benchmarking studies of recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have relied on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, limiting their relevance to human tissues. Here, we compared three 10x single-cell RNA profiling methods, fresh tumor scRNA-seq, flash-frozen single-nucleus Multiome, and FFPE single-nucleus Flex (snFlex), using clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) biopsies. Across methods, we observed broadly consistent cell type-specific transcriptional profiles among major ccRCC cell populations. Despite lower gene and UMI counts, snFlex reliably identified fine-grained states within CD8+ T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and tumor compartments, comparable to those detected by scRNA-seq. Together, these findings highlight the distinct advantages of each technology depending on sample preservation type and study design, providing practical guidance for single-cell RNA profiling technology selection in translational studies using human tumor biopsies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Drug-Eluting, Radiopaque, Tumor-Casting Hydrogels for Endovascular Locoregional Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dong, Y. C., Villasenor, K. E., +6 authors, Cormode, D. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. For patients with unresectable disease, locoregional therapies, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), are the standard of care. However, even with this treatment, the average survival rate is only 27% at 5 years. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of novel approaches to improve responses through more complete embolization and targeting ischemia-induced molecular dependencies. To build on these findings, we developed an injectable chitosan-based hydrogel system (AuNP-Lys05-gel) that we hypothesized might be a more effective embolic material by (i) enabling a more complete filling of tumor feeding blood vessels in a cast-like manner, (ii) encapsulating Lys05, a potent autophagy inhibitor, and (iii) providing X-ray contrast for direct visualization of the embolization. Chitosan hydrogels of varying composition were formed and characterized. We found that Lys05 could be loaded in this type of hydrogel and that it was released gradually over 7 days. We found that AuNP was better retained by the hydrogel than iopamidol, an FDA-approved contrast agent, indicating that AuNP would provide longer-lasting CT monitoring. In a rat model of HCC, AuNP-Lys05-gel reduced tumor growth and resulted in a 67% objective response rate vs 26% for a clinically used particle embolic. Histology indicated effective vascular occlusion by the gel. These findings indicate that AuNP-Lys05-gel merits further investigation as a treatment for HCC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Comparison of in vitro migration assays evaluating nintedanib's migration inhibitory effects on melanoma cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Afrodité Németh, Gréta L Bányai, Mátyás Andrészek, +2 authors, Tamás Garay</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell migration plays a central role in tumor progression and metastasis, making it a critical parameter in both cancer biology and therapeutic evaluation. A range of in vitro migration assays are commonly used to assess treatment-induced effects on motility, each with distinct advantages and limitations that must be considered when interpreting results. In this study, we systematically compared four migration assay formats-scratch, zone-exclusion (Z-E), transwell, and single-cell tracking-across five melanoma cell lines treated with the multi-kinase inhibitor nintedanib. Migration inhibition was quantified for each assay, alongside machine learning-based classification to evaluate the discriminative power of assay-derived features in detecting treatment effects. All assays detected inhibitory effects of nintedanib, although response magnitude varied across formats. The transwell assay demonstrated clear inhibition in most lines but was sensitive to morphological changes. Gap closure assay-based migration rankings were influenced by cell size, underscoring the importance of size normalization. Scratch assays exhibited greater variability and potential confounding due to cell damage, while Z-E assays generated more uniform gaps without mechanical disruption. Single-cell tracking enabled high-resolution phenotypic profiling, including cell-specific features such as size and shape, resulting in consistently high classification accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate assay formats to accurately evaluate migration behavior and the therapeutic efficacy of anti-migratory compounds.</p>
