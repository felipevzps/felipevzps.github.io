<h2 class="paper-title">Genetic biosensor for optimizing double-stranded RNA production by bacterial symbionts</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Navarro-Escalante, L., VanDieren, A. J., Barrick, J. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> There is growing interest in engineering animal and plant microbiomes to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for RNA interference (RNAi) applications. We developed a genetically encoded biosensor that uses bimolecular fluorescence complementation to monitor dsRNA levels within bacterial cells to accelerate the symbiont-mediated RNAi design-build-test cycle. We validated performance of the sensor in Escherichia coli and demonstrated enhanced dsRNA accumulation in engineered strains of the aphid symbiont Serratia symbiotica.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering Cybergenetic Cell-Based Therapies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chang, C.-H., Arampatzis, A., +5 authors, Khammash, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive, closed-loop control of cellular behavior is essential for next-generation therapies, yet most current treatments operate in an open-loop manner and lack robustness to patient variability and disease dynamics. Here, we establish a control-theoretic platform for rational engineering of closed-loop cell-based therapies that achieve precise and robust regulation. First, we introduce multi-dimensional nullgram profiling, a high-throughput approach that enables quantitative prediction and design of advanced genetic controllers in human cells across circuit topologies and parameter regimes in a single experiment. To evaluate dynamic therapeutic behavior, we next develop Cyberpatient-in-the-loop, an optogenetic digital twin platform that interfaces engineered mammalian cells with computational disease models, enabling systematic testing of closed-loop performance under realistic perturbations. Finally, we leverage these approaches to implement integral feedback cell therapies that sense inflammatory signals and autonomously regulate cytokine levels in primary immune cell cultures. Together, these results establish a general paradigm for engineering cell-based control systems and provide a foundation for next-generation cell therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A reconfigurable DNA memory architecture for hierarchical data management via programmable phase transitions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ye, J., Liu, A., +3 authors, Fan, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA has emerged as a promising medium for the post-silicon era of information storage due to its ultrahigh density and longevity. However, current systems are bifurcated, with solid-state systems providing robust cold archival but lacking accessibility, while fluidic molecular computing systems offer dynamic processing but suffer from low density and instability. This mutual exclusivity has hindered the development of hierarchical memory, a standard in modern computing, within molecular storage systems. Here, we bridge this gap by engineering a reconfigurable DNA memory architecture driven by programmable liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Our system leverages sequence-based encoding to achieve an ultrahigh storage density of 7x10^10 GB/g, approaching the theoretical limits of DNA accessibility. In its fluidic hot state, DNA droplets enable rapid data loading (~83.8% in 5 min) and function as an in-memory editing platform supporting versatile, addressable bit-level operations including selective erasure (~65.1%) and high-efficiency rewriting and replacement (&gt;99%) via programmable strand displacement. Importantly, to resolve the stability trade-off, we engineered a programmable phase transition whereby the triggered assembly of a rigid tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) armor transforms liquid condensates into robust armored droplets. This cold state confers exceptional resistance to enzymatic and physical degradation, projecting multi-millennial data stability. By enabling reversible transitions between an editable, high-density computing mode and a stabilized archival mode, this work establishes the architectural foundation for scalable molecular information storage capable of hierarchical data management.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fundamental limitations of genomic language models for realistic sequence generation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tzanakakis, A., Mouratidis, I., Georgakopoulos-Soares, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, prompting interest in their application to genomic sequence analysis. Genomic Language Models based on similar architectures offer a promising avenue for synthetic genome generation and characterization. However, their effectiveness for biological sequence modeling remains poorly characterized. We present a comprehensive evaluation of a state-of-the-art genomic Language Model (gLM), Evo 2, on multiple genomic reconstruction tasks. We tested Evo 2 on diverse prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral genomes and assessed performance across key biological features and organizational patterns. Our results reveal systematic failures in gLM-based genomic reconstruction. While the synthetic sequences captured local sequence statistics, they consistently failed to preserve long-range genomic organization, repeat and k-mer composition, transcription factor binding site architecture, and evolutionary constraints. Generated sequences exhibited severe violations of natural genomic patterns and models showed particular difficulty with repetitive elements. These evaluation criteria provide a set of biologically grounded benchmarks for assessing the quality and realism of synthetic genomes. These findings suggest fundamental limitations in current gLM architectures for capturing the hierarchical, evolutionarily-constrained nature of genomic sequences. Our work highlights the need for specialized architectures that explicitly model biological constraints rather than relying solely on statistical patterns, with important implications for computational biology applications requiring realistic sequence generation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SE3Bind: SE(3)-equivariant model for antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Subedy, A., Bhadra-Lobo, S., Lamoureux, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting antibody-antigen binding affinity is critical for therapeutic development, but machine learning-based approaches to the problem are typically hampered by the small amount of available structural and affinity data. We introduce SE3Bind, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture trained on two related tasks: re-docking of an antibody structure to its matching antigen structure, and antibody-antigen binding free energy prediction. Both tasks encourage the model to learn an energy function formulated in terms of scalar and vector fields associated with each protein. Under a stringent training/validation split of the data based on antigen sequence similarity, SE3Bind demonstrates an ability to generalize to out-of-distribution examples and achieves a performance comparable to that of existing models evaluated under similar conditions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Long-term Musculoskeletal and Marrow Sparing with Proton FLASH in Juvenile Mice: Implications for Pediatric Osteosarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hu, Z., Titt, U., +10 authors, Mohan, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. Radiotherapy is limited by intrinsic radioresistance and the risk of severe long-term musculoskeletal toxicities. FLASH radiotherapy, delivered at ultra-high dose rates (&gt;40 Gy/s), has demonstrated normal tissue sparing in preclinical models, but its effects on the developing skeleton and marrow remain poorly defined. This study evaluated the chronic normal tissue effects of proton FLASH in juvenile mice, modeling the pediatric context. Methods and Materials: Juvenile C57BL/6 mice (3-4 weeks old) were randomized to receive 11 Gy FLASH ({approx}200 Gy/s) or conventional proton irradiation (0.2 Gy/s average), or sham treatment to the left hind leg using a synchrotron-based proton beamline. Mice were followed for 10 weeks post-treatment. Bone toxicity was assessed with microCT (bone mineral density, bone volume fractions, trabecular indices) and histology. Bone marrow cellularity was quantified on H&amp;E-stained sections, and muscle fibrosis was assessed using Masson's trichrome. Results: FLASH-treated mice exhibited significant preservation of bone microarchitecture compared with conventional treated mice, with higher bone mineral density and bone volume fractions (p &lt; 0.05). Trabecular numbers were maintained, while structure model index indicates a mechanically favorable trabecular structures in the FLASH group. Bone marrow cellularity was preserved in FLASH mice (5.3% reduction vs. sham) compared with conventional (11.3 % reduction, p &lt; 0.05). Muscle fibrosis was significantly lower in FLASH group (fibrosis positivity 2.6 % vs. 3.0% for FLASH vs. conventional CONV, p &lt; 0.05). No severe immobility or weight loss was observed across groups. Conclusions: Proton FLASH significantly reduces long-term bone, marrow, and muscle toxicities in juvenile mice. These findings provide the first demonstration of musculoskeletal sparing in a synchrotron proton FLASH platform and highlight its translational potential for pediatric osteosarcoma.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Hallmark-Integrated, Agent-Based Framework for Intratumor Heterogeneity in Melanoma Evolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jamshad, K., Jackson, T. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in multiregion sequencing have revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) - the presence of genetically distinct subclones within a single tumor. ITH profoundly influences tumor behavior, including well-accepted hallmarks of cancer such as sustained proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and immune evasion, and the emergence of therapeutic resistance. In this work, we introduce a hallmark-integrated branching evolution process agent-based model (BEP-HI) to study the emergence of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in melanoma under coupled genetic, immune, and spatial selection pressures. Using this model, we identify three distinct evolutionary ITH modes and demonstrate a mechanistic decoupling between tumor growth kinetics and heterogeneity. We further show that immune recruitment exerts the strongest influence on ITH through nonlinear immune-editing feedback, while motility of melanoma cells shapes complex morphologies in different ITH modes as observed in clinical SSM tumors. This work provides a biologically grounded and adaptable computational framework for exploring how hallmark interactions shape ITH evolution and for generating virtual tumor cohorts that link genetic diversity with tumor behavior, morphology, and treatment resistance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting PI3Kβ-dependent cancer with a novel small molecule inhibitor, GT220</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, Q., Cheng, H., +5 authors, Zhao, J. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> PI3K{beta} is a critical oncogenic driver in cancers harboring PTEN loss or activating PIK3CB alterations, yet effective and selective PI3K{beta}-targeted therapies remain lacking. Here, we report the development and preclinical characterization of GT220, a highly selective and potent small-molecule PI3K{beta} inhibitor developed through an integrated artificial-intelligence-driven design, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacologic optimization pipeline. GT220 exhibits exceptional biochemical selectivity for PI3K{beta}, binding with sub-nanomolar affinity and showing minimal activity against other class I PI3K isoforms or the broader protein kinome. In cellular models, GT220 potently suppresses AKT phosphorylation and selectively inhibits viability of PTEN-deficient cancer cells, while sparing PTEN- and PIK3CB-wild-type, PI3K-dependent cells. In vivo, GT220 achieves favorable tumor exposure with sustained PI3K{beta} pathway inhibition and demonstrates robust antitumor efficacy and good tolerability in PTEN-deficient breast cancer xenograft models. In contrast, GT220 shows no antitumor activity or pathway inhibition in PTEN-wild-type, PI3K-dependent tumors, underscoring its context-dependent mechanism of action. Collectively, these findings establish GT220 as a next-generation PI3K{beta} inhibitor with a clear therapeutic window and provide strong preclinical rationale for precision targeting of PI3K{beta}-dependent cancers.</p>
