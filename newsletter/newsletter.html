<h2 class="paper-title">High-throughput mapping of 6,888 RAD51D variants identifies distinct biochemical functions needed for homologous recombination and olaparib response</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Darrah, K. E., Hemker, S. L., +18 authors, Bernstein, K. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The tumor suppressor RAD51D is essential for homologous recombination (HR). Pathogenic variants in RAD51D are associated with breast and ovarian cancers. However, most clinical missense variants are of unknown significance. We performed a multiplex assay of variant effect to test 6,888 RAD51D coding variants for loss-of-function. The resulting variant-to-function map perfectly separates known pathogenic and benign variants and is validated by orthogonal HR and biochemical assays across 70 clinical variants. Our screen shows that variants in the DNA-binding or ATPase core most severely compromise HR, and we identify the RAD51D-RAD51C interface within the BCDX2 complex as essential for regulating its ATPase activity. We hypothesize that, paradoxically, the primary function of RAD51D is to slow the ATPase activity of BCDX2, thereby allowing sufficient time and space for RAD51 filament assembly. Together, we identify hotspots of deleterious RAD51D variants and uncover the mechanisms by which variants compromise its biochemical functions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cell Death Induced by Homoisoflavonoid Brazilin and its Semi-synthetic Derivates on MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 Breast Cancer Cell Lines</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zuniga-Eulogio, M., Quinteros, M., +6 authors, Navarro-Tito, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that have been extensively explored as scaffolds for drug development due to their diverse biological activities. Brazilin, a homoisoflavonoid with reported antitumoral properties, does not fully meet pharmaceutical criteria, and chemical modification of natural compounds is often required to enhance bioactivity and efficacy. Here, we evaluated the pro-apoptotic activity of Brazilin and its semi-synthesized methoxylated (OMe)3 and acetylated (OAc)3 derivatives in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. We assessed cell viability, proliferation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial integrity, and analyzed apoptotic features using confocal microscopy, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize transcriptomic changes in MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with unmodified Brazilin or its derivatives. Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas MCF7 cells exhibited increased viability and growth in response to Brazilin-(OMe)3. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 induced apoptosis-associated features, including chromatin condensation, {gamma}H2AX accumulation, and PARP cleavage. These effects were accompanied by a modest increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, no cytotoxic or apoptotic features were detected in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Brazilin treatment upregulated genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, including ATF3, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Brazilin and its acetylated derivative selectively induce mitochondrial stress and cell death in triple-negative breast cancer cells, potentially involving ER stress pathways.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tumor cell death by ferroptosis contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in syngeneic murine models of cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mbah, N. E., Sutton, D., +17 authors, Lyssiotis, C. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by profound metabolic rewiring and a strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, both of which contribute to poor therapeutic responses. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a potential strategy to overcome immune suppression by coupling tumor cell death to anti-tumor immune activation. Here, we investigated whether targeting amino acid metabolism in PDAC can induce ICD and promote tumor immunity. Through a focused metabolic screen in a panel of syngeneic mouse cancer cell lines, we identified cysteine restriction as a robust inducer of multiple damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in vitro, hallmark features of ICD. In addition to driving DAMPs, cystine-deprived tumor cells also promoted dendritic cell phagocytosis, maturation, and proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro. Because cysteine deprivation is a known trigger of ferroptosis, we further demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) similarly elicited ICD-associated features, which were reversible by the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1. To define additional immune-modulatory signals associated with ferroptosis, we performed metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of cells undergoing, but not yet committed to, ferroptotic death. These analyses revealed selective release of immunosuppressive metabolites and oxidized phospholipids. Consistent with this, conditioned media from ferroptotic cells impaired CD8 T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro. Thus, together our results indicated that the induction of ferroptotic immunogenic cell death led to the release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. Subsequent analysis in vivo revealed that ferroptotic tumor cells predominantly contributed to a tumor-protective environment. In particular, tumors inoculated with ferroptotic cells were enriched with immunosuppressive myeloid cells and exhibited reduced populations of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Further investigation using immune compromised mice suggested that ferroptotic cells may suppress both adaptive and innate immune responses. Collectively, these results underscore the complex and highly context-dependent effects of ferroptosis on tumor immunity, highlighting the critical importance of in vivo models to determine true immunogenic potential within the tumor microenvironment.</p>
