<h2 class="paper-title">Genome-Level Hierarchical Attention Transformer with Multi-Head Attention Weighted Sum for Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction and Discovery of Resistance-Related Genomic Contexts</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Park, S., Kim, H., +1 author, Oh, H.-S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health concern, requiring reliable tools for predicting resistance across a wide range of bacteria and antibiotics. In this study, we introduce a genome-level hierarchical attention transformer (GL-HAT) that integrates a pretrained genomic foundation model with hierarchical attention mechanisms to analyze the full protein sequence context of bacterial genomes. GL-HAT is designed to deliver both accurate resistance predictions and interpretable insights into the genomic features associated with resistance using specialized modules. Trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset of bacterial genomes and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, the model outperformed traditional machine learning method, with an F1-score of 0.845 and AUROC of 0.953. Moreover, GL-HAT could demonstrate the resistance-related contexts in the genome, such as vanA operon and nearby resolvase genes in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and tet(M) gene adjacent to conjugation proteins in tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. By combining high accuracy with interpretability, GL-HAT offers a practical approach for advancing AMR diagnostics and research, supporting more informed clinical and public health decisions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rewiring of RNA-protein coupling in osteocytes in response to hyperglycemic levels of glucose</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Marahleh, A., Rashad, S., +3 authors, Kitaura, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Osteocytes are central regulators of skeletal homeostasis, yet how their transcriptome and proteome jointly adapt to metabolic stress is unclear. Here, we combined RNA-sequencing with label-free quantitative proteomics in MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells exposed to hyperglycemic levels of glucose, to interrogate RNA-protein coupling at baseline and under hyperglycemic stress. Transcriptionally, high glucose and mannitol elicited overlapping osmoadaptive transcriptional programs indicative of metabolic remodeling, whereas high glucose alone induced mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation downregulation alongside selective activation of bone anabolic and inflammatory pathways. RNA-protein integration revealed moderate coupling at baseline, indicating that mRNA levels capture only part of the proteomic output. High glucose reorganized RNA-protein relationship, sorting genes into four patterns of matched or opposing RNA-protein responses. The four groups were enriched in distinct biological pathways that shaped cellular response to stress exposing significant post-transcriptional and translational control under high glucose levels. These data indicate that osteocytes adapt to stress through program-specific RNA-protein interactions in which post-transcriptional regulation of protein translation reshapes the proteome beyond what is predicted by mRNA levels.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A computational workflow for microscopy-guided ion identification in clinical mass spectrometry imaging datasets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nastase, A.-M., Yip, P. K., +1 author, Barjat, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) datasets were acquired from brain tissue samples obtained from living traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. This is a proof-of-concept study which presents a computational workflow for identifying TBI-specific ions in MSI datasets through integrated pathological annotation and mass spectrometry imaging analysis. Pathological annotations of TBI regions were obtained from haematoxylin and eosin-stained microscopy images of the same sections. The microscopy images were then registered with the MSI datasets to enable precise delineation of TBI areas within the MSI data. Binary masks of the registered TBI regions were then used to perform cosine similarity searches, identifying ions potentially associated with TBI pathology. In order to relatively quantify the difference magnitude between TBI regions and surrounding tissue, bootstrap sampling was applied to non-TBI tissue areas, generating mean intensity values for comparison with average TBI region intensities. Additionally, a synthetic MSI dataset was generated to validate and optimise this analytical approach. Using this integrated computational workflow, TBI specific ions were identified in clinical MSI datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-Omics Integration Reveals Lipid Metabolic Reprogramming as a Driver of Cystogenesis in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zararsiz, G., Kianmehr, L., +10 authors, Glaab, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a most common hereditary kidney disorder and a major contributor to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), but its molecular progression mechanisms are unclear. We performed metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling on a longitudinal cohort of 254 and 47 ADPKD patients, respectively, to identify molecular alterations and then applied Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) to uncover coordinated signatures. Disease progression was associated with a marked shift in dysregulated lipids profile, increased acylcarnitines, and increased glycolytic metabolites, suggesting a shift from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) toward glycolysis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of PPAR signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cystogenesis, providing a mechanistic link between metabolic alterations and structural dysregulation. Integrative analysis identified a central axis where inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, and cytoskeletal remodeling converges. Our integrated multi-omics analysis defines a molecular framework where transcriptomic dysregulation drives metabolic reprogramming contribute to cystogenesis, providing potential biomarkers and insights to guide precision therapy in ADPKD progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Computational Pipeline for Glioblastoma Vaccine Development: Integrating Novel Omics-Driven OIP5 Target Discovery to Create a Deep Learning-Based Immunogenicity Framework for Personalized Immunotherapy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mahapatra, R., Sundar, A., Shekhar, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This work introduces a modular, open-source computational pipeline for glioblastoma (GBM) vaccine design that integrates omics-based OIP5 target discovery with a deep learning framework for epitope immunogenicity prediction. Building upon conventional affinity-based predictors such as NetMHCpan, our Tumor Epitope Immunogenicity Pipeline (TEIP) incorporates biological, structural, and transcriptomic context to predict tumor-specific T-cell responses. Using curated immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptides from IEDB and GBM datasets, TEIP employs dual bidirectional LSTM encoders to represent peptide and HLA sequences, concatenated with auxiliary molecular features including proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport likelihood, gene expression, and mutation frequency. These features are fused into a probabilistic model that outputs peptide-specific immunogenicity scores and confidence estimates. Benchmark results across multiple HLA alleles demonstrate that TEIP outperforms NetMHCpan and MARIA, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.89 and PR-AUC of 0.35. Feature importance analysis confirms that tumor-specific expression and peptide-MHC binding dominate predictive accuracy, validating the biological realism of the model. By combining mechanistic features with data-driven representation learning, TEIP enables fine-grained prioritization of neoantigens with translational potential. In proof-of-concept GBM studies, TEIP recovered known cancer-testis antigens such as OIP5, demonstrating its ability to identify clinically relevant vaccine targets. The pipeline is implemented using entirely open-access data and software to promote reproducibility and scalability. Collectively, TEIP provides a unified framework that connects multi-omics tumor characterization with deep learning: based antigen modeling, establishing a foundation for precision immunotherapy development in glioblastoma and beyond.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Sampling Function-Related Metastable States of Proteins With DASH</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zha, J., Zheng, Z., +13 authors, Zhang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rational discovery of function-specific protein modulators as well as activity-enhanced engineering proteins underscore the need to identify function-related metastable states (FMSs) of proteins. However, current experimental and computational methods struggle to generate these states directly from their native state (NS), likely because the NS [-&gt;] FMS transition is non-spontaneous. To address this challenge, we introduce Deep learning guided Adaptive sampling with seed Selection and Hopping (DASH), integrating both deep learning and physical functions to guide molecular dynamics (MD) simulation towards FMS. DASH successfully sampled NS [-&gt;] FMS transitions in 18 cases across two tasks: protein activation and cryptic allosteric site opening. DASH combined with secondary-structure collective variables is further able to sample folding of disordered regions. Compared to existing methods, DASH demonstrates superior performance while requiring comparable simulation time. Crucially, we applied DASH to sample new conformations of proteins, by which revealing new folding states, previously unknown allosteric sites, and potential activators. These predictions have been further verified in wet-lab experiments and crystal structures determinations. Collectively, our framework provides a robust strategy for function-specific pharmacy research and could accelerate future drug discovery efforts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biophysically Grounded Deep Learning Improves Protein-Protein ΔΔG Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Feldman, J., Maechler, A., +1 author, Shakhnovich, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting how mutations alter protein-protein binding affinity ({Delta}{Delta}G) is central to protein engineering and therapeutic design, yet current deep learning models often fail to generalize beyond narrow benchmarks. We show that SKEMPI2, the field's dominant training and evaluation dataset, suffers from widespread and previously underappreciated data leakage caused by deep sequence and structural redundancy, leading to inflated performance estimates. We introduce ProtBFF (Protein Biophysical Feature Framework), an encoder-agnostic module that injects five interpretable biophysical priors into residue-level representations via cross-embedding attention. ProtBFF consistently improves performance under homology-based-clustering evaluation and enables general-purpose encoders, such as ESM, to match or surpass state-of-the-art specialized models or larger size models. These results demonstrate that incorporating biophysical priors could be key to robust protein property prediction.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Benetti, C., Almolla, O., +4 authors, Boccalatte, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy characterized by diverse transcriptional and genomic alterations. Recent studies have defined a set of recurrent molecular subtypes associated with distinct differentiation stages and clinical outcomes. However, no unified framework currently exists for assigning these subtypes in a standardized and accessible manner. Existing approaches often rely on mutation or fusion detection and may overlook broader transcriptional programs. The lack of a comprehensive, transcriptome-based classification tool has hampered the use of subtype-specific insights in both research and clinical settings. Here, we present a machine learning-based classifier trained on transcriptomic data to predict previously defined multi-omic subtypes of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The model accurately assigns subtype identity across patient samples and cell lines, and provides a practical tool for standardized molecular stratification, supporting future integration into diagnostic and translational workflows, as demonstrated by its ability to reveal subtype-specific patterns of relapse.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">B-PPI: A Cross-Attention Model for Large-Scale Bacterial Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Agassy, C., Samuel, B., +2 authors, Burstein, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for the study of cellular function, yet computational prediction of bacterial PPIs remains limited. Most existing methods are trained on human data, reducing their applicability to bacterial systems. Here, we present B-PPI, a computational tool specifically designed for bacterial PPI prediction. B-PPI leverages embeddings from ProstT5, a structure-aware protein language model, and a cross-attention mechanism to capture residue-level inter-protein relationships. To facilitate training, we constructed B-PPI-DB, a large-scale bacterial PPI dataset derived from STRING, comprising 202,829 positive and negative interactions across 2,646 taxa with a 1:10 positive-to-negative ratio. We benchmarked B-PPI against TT3D, a state-of-the-art model trained on human PPI, which was previously evaluated on bacterial PPIs. B-PPI achieved substantially higher performance on bacterial data (AUPRC 0.926 vs. 0.230 and F1 0.866 vs. 0.299) with faster runtime. We further demonstrate that the model adapts to unseen bacterial interactions with minimal fine-tuning. Together, B-PPI and B-PPI-DB address a critical gap in computational microbiology, offering a framework for bacterial PPI prediction and a data resource for benchmarking and developing new tools in the field.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Orphan Non-Coding RNAs Drive Tumorigenesis and Enable Pre-Diagnostic Detection in HPV-Negative Head and Neck Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nguyen, H. C. B., Li, L., +13 authors, Goodarzi, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lacks reliable biomarkers for early detection and molecular stratification. We recently described orphan non-coding RNAs (oncRNAs) as a class of cancer-emergent small RNAs that arise from cryptic promoters largely silent in normal tissues. Here, we define the comprehensive landscape of oncRNAs in HNSCC. Using TCGA and CPTAC-3 data, we demonstrate that these transcripts are not only tumor-specific but provide digital fingerprints that accurately stratify tumors by anatomical site. Moving from association to function, we investigated whether these emergent transcripts actively drive tumorigenesis. We focused on oncRNA64585, a transcript highly enriched in oral cavity tumors and associated with tumor progression. Its depletion significantly impaired proliferation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in syngeneic murine models. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling revealed that oncRNA64585 regulates transcriptional programs governing cell cycle progression and apoptosis through interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Finally, we demonstrate the clinical utility of these signatures: oncRNA profiles in plasma predicted oral cavity cancer with &gt;90% accuracy up to four years prior to clinical diagnosis. These findings establish oncRNAs as active drivers of HNSCC biology and potent tools for early detection and therapeutic targeting.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An Atlas of Extrachromosomal DNA Structures Illuminates Its Evolution and Biogenesis in Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wong, C.-H., Wei, K.-C., +10 authors, Wei, C.-L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent driver of oncogene amplification across diverse types of cancers. Leveraging single-molecule long-read sequencing and a de novo circular genome assembler, ecLego3, we charted a comprehensive atlas of ecDNA structures from longitudinal pairs of primary and recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Our approach resolved 23 ecDNA genomes representing major oncogenes associated with GBM pathogenesis and revealed a dynamic configuration characterized by pronounced structural variation and multi-species co-existence within individual tumors. Evolutionary trajectories were shaped by hierarchical accrual of structural variants, predominated by deletions and inversions, giving rise to novel oncogene isoforms and enhancer repositioning. Such structural plasticity promotes intratumor heterogeneity and tumor fitness. Multiomic analyses at single cell resolution linked ecDNA abundance and structure to transcriptional output, uncovering non-linear scaling and synergistic co-selection among multiple ecDNA species. Comparative profiling revealed locus-dependent configuration, a contraction of ecDNA diversity upon recurrence, and convergent structural architectures across patients, implicating repeat-mediated genomic rearrangements and replication stress in ecDNA biogenesis. These findings elucidate ecDNA-driven mechanisms of tumor adaptation and highlight new molecular vulnerabilities, informing potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for high-grade gliomas.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Adaptive regulation of dNTP homeostasis confers osimertinib resistance in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xie, Q., Wang, Y., +7 authors, Li, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Maintaining sustained deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools is essential for DNA replication fidelity and genome stability. In EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), we find that disruption of dNTP homeostasis plays a critical role in determining sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib and in shaping mechanisms of acquired resistance. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that osimertinib suppresses RRM2 expression, a key regulator of dNTP synthesis, through the downregulation of the transcription factor MYBL2. In response to osimertinib-mediated replication stress and dNTP depletion, cells activated a compensatory pathway involving the stress-inducible ribonucleotide reductase subunit RRM2B via a novel transcriptional regulator, TNNT3. We further identified CHK2 signaling as essential for TNNT3 nuclear translocation and RRM2B transcriptional activation. Inhibition of CHK2 or combined CHK1/2 blockade impaired RRM2B induction, exacerbated replication stress, and delayed the development of osimertinib resistance both in vitro and in xenograft models. Collectively, our findings reveal that EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells rely on a dynamic EGFR-MYBL2-RRM2 and CHK2-TNNT3-RRM2B regulatory axis to maintain dNTP pool balance under therapeutic pressure. Disruption of this axis sensitizes tumors to osimertinib and impairs the acquisition of resistance, highlighting dNTP metabolism as a critical vulnerability and actionable target in EGFR-driven lung cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Sensitizing the Cell Killing Effects of Doxorubicin as a Possible Therapeutic Strategy Against Glioblastoma Multiforme</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Berdis, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common type of brain cancer, is also the deadliest of all cancers, having 5-year survival rates of less than 10%. Standard therapy for GBM includes surgery followed by ionizing radiation and treatment with temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent. Unfortunately, even with aggressive treatments with these modalities, the median survival time for most GBM patients is less than 16 months. This study examines a new treatment strategy by combining doxorubicin, a soluble DNA-damaging agent that produces double-stranded DNA like ionizing radiation, with an artificial nucleoside designated 5-nitroindolyl-2-deoxyriboside (5-NIdR) that inhibits the misreplication of DNA lesions produced by the drug. Cell-based studies with grade 3 and grade 4 astrocytomas demonstrate that combining 5-NIdR with doxorubicin improves the cell-killing effects of the drug by increasing apoptosis. Flow cytometry experiments demonstrate that 5-NIdR does not increase the level of reactive oxygen species produced by doxorubicin. Instead, the increase in cell death produced by combining the two agents likely reflects inhibiting the replication of damaged DNA. Consistent with this mechanism, cell-cycle experiments demonstrate that this combination blocks cells at Go/G1, suggesting that 5-NIdR interferes with DNA polymerase activity during the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The ability of 5-NIdR to inhibit double-strand DNA break repair could be extended to other modalities used to treat brain cancer such as ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the chemosensitizing effect of 5-NIdR could improve the overall efficacy of doxorubicin by lowering the risk of side effects caused by the DNA-damaging agent.</p>
