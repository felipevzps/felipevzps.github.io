<h2 class="paper-title">Allosteric Ligand-Aptamer Complexes Orchestrate Supramolecular or Transient Catalytic, Transcription and Fibrinogenesis Processes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Froim, D., Amartely, H., +2 authors, Willner, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Allosteric regulation, the modulation of biological macromolecular function through binding of molecules at distant sites distinct from the active site, is a fundamental principle in biology that governs enzyme activity, signaling, and gene expression. In this work, we present allosteric ligand/aptamer complexes, coupled to biocatalytic reaction modules composed of enzymes, DNAzymes, or transcription machineries, regulating the catalytic and transient functions of these frameworks. This principle is exemplified by the assembly of ligand/aptamer subunits supramolecular complexes that allosterically stabilize the Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme, allowing its ribonucleobase cleavage activity, promoting the formation of transcription templates that yield RNA products, and modulating the assembly of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit thrombin-induced coagulation. Specifically, melamine (Mel)/aptamer subunits complexes allosterically stabilize the assembly of Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme strands for substrate cleavage, the formation of thrombin aptamer subunits that inhibit the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and the stabilization of a transcription template encoding the Malachite Green (MG) RNA aptamer. Furthermore, coupling an enzyme that depletes the ligand/aptamer complex, which allosterically stabilizes the biocatalytic reaction module, demonstrates the dissipative and transient operation of the catalytic system. This concept is illustrated by the adenosine (Ade)/aptamer subunits supramolecular complex, which stabilizes thrombin aptamer subunits to inhibit thrombin-induced fibrinogenesis, and promotes the formation of an active transcription template for RNA synthesis. In the presence of adenosine deaminase (ADA), Ade is transformed into inosine, which lacks affinity for the aptamer subunits, thereby degrading the Ade/aptamer assemblies and depleting the allosteric complexes. The temporal disassembly of these allosteric stabilizing complexes leads to the transient inhibition of thrombin-induced coagulation or to the transient operation of a transcription machinery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Web engine for tumor pathology image retrievals on massive scales</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhong, Z., Huang, J., +8 authors, Jiang, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&amp;E) is widely used in clinical practice, but efficient and versatile image retrieval tools are lacking. We developed the H&amp;E Retrieval Engine (HERE, https://hereapp.ccr.cancer.gov) to analyze patient cases based on image similarities to database records. Using H&amp;E image regions as input, HERE searches 21.2 terabytes of whole-slide images from multiple tumor histopathology cohorts through a 12.1-gigabyte memory index, and returns top images containing regions similar to the query. HERE scans high-resolution images in the database using accurate artificial intelligence encoding and ultra-efficient hierarchical skip indexing. HERE demonstrated performance superior to existing image retrieval tools based on blinded pathologist scoring using benchmark queries that represent key image features of human tumors. By pairing spatial transcriptomics with H&amp;E images, HERE also enables retrieving image features from gene transcriptomics input and identifies molecular pathways associated with tumor histologies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PIONEER: A Periplasmic Display Platform for Synthetic Biology-Based Screening of Genetically Encoded Protein Regulators</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Isom, D. G., Rowe, J. B., Lee, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Periplasmic display in yeast is a promising but underdeveloped method for screening and studying genetically encoded biomolecules. We present PIONEER, a modular platform that localizes peptides, proteins, and nanobodies to the membrane-proximal periplasmic space of S. cerevisiae, enabling direct interrogation of membrane protein function. By optimizing secretion signals and display scaffolds, PIONEER ensures stable ligand retention and robust autocrine signaling. The ability to assess peptide and protein ligand activity through signaling, rather than binding alone, marks a key advance toward function-first screening. Applied to human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the system enables detection of surface expression, ligand activity profiling, and classification of nanobody regulators, including antagonists and conformational stabilizers. It also distinguishes intrabodies based on their functional effects and chaperone activity. Although demonstrated with GPCRs, PIONEER is adaptable to a wide range of membrane and soluble protein targets. As AI-driven design expands the space of candidate ligands and binders, this platform offers a scalable method for linking predicted sequences and their structures to biological function.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">velotest: Statistical assessment of RNA velocity embeddings reveals quality differences for reliable trajectory visualizations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bischoff, S., Policar, P. G., +3 authors, Schröder, C. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Contemporary single-cell RNA-sequencing studies typically use RNA velocity analyses to investigate cellular dynamics. Commonly, RNA velocities are assessed with two-dimensional projections. Although it is well established that nonlinear embeddings of gene expression data cannot comprehensively preserve the structure of the original high-dimensional data across scales, there is no tool that systematically assesses and quantifies the faithfulness of velocity embeddings. This situation potentially leads to misleading velocity visualizations and putative cell state transitions. To this end, we introduce velotest, a cell-level statistical test that quantifies the faithfulness of a velocity embedding with respect to its high-dimensional counterpart. Applying velotest across multiple datasets and embedding methods, we find strong differences in the embedding qualities between embedding methods, datasets, and regions in individual datasets. velotest thus provides an essential validation step and enables researchers to select a suitable visualization of high-dimensional velocities, ensuring that hypotheses drawn from velocity projections are grounded in accurately represented dynamics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Universal super-resolution for subcellular fluorescence imaging</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, X., Zhang, R., +9 authors, Qu, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has emerged as an essential instrument for investigating subcellular structures and monitoring intracellular physiology. Despite rapid advances driven by deep learning, most existing approaches are modality specific and exhibit limited generalizability, restricting their practical applicability. Here we introduce universal super-resolution (UniSR), a framework that operates across microscopes and subcellular structures without optical modifications or prior sample knowledge. UniSR is initially pre-trained on simulated image pairs to establish mappings from low- to high-resolution features and subsequently fine-tuned with only one experimental image pair, reducing data demand and acquisition time. Across wide-field and point-scanning modalities, UniSR enhances resolution to match structured illumination, single-molecule localization, or stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Applied to diverse biological samples, it reveals nanoscale structures, dynamic processes, and organelle interactions with high spatiotemporal fidelity. UniSR provides a practical and broadly generalizable tool for super-resolution imaging in live-cell research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TWAS-CTL: A robust and efficient method for multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies using cross-tissue learners</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Billah, M. M., Wei, H., +1 author, Zhang, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The advent of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has expanded the classical genome-wide association study (GWAS) framework by integrating gene expression with genetic variation to identify trait-associated variants. While multi-tissue TWAS approaches improve statistical power over single-tissue models, existing methods often lose information during result aggregation and require intensive computation. Here, we present TWAS-CTL (Cross Tissue Learner), a novel framework that leverages heterogeneous gene expression across tissues by adaptively reweighting and optimizing multiple single-tissue learners. Simulations demonstrate that TWAS-CTL achieves higher statistical power than the leading method, UTMOST, while maintaining proper type I error control and reducing computational time by over half. When applied to the analysis of the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GOKIND) cohort, we observed that TWAS-CTL identified more susceptible genes associated with diabetes than both UTMOST and PrediXcan, another widely used method in TWAS. These results establish TWAS-CTL as a powerful and efficient tool for cross-tissue gene expression analysis, capable of integrating heterogeneous gene-trait associations to advance genetic discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Uncovering novel therapeutics for schizophrenia: a multitarget approach using the CANDO platform</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hu, Y., Samudrala, R., Falls, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Schizophrenia is a complex and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, many remaining insufficiently addressed by current treatments. High rates of treatment resistance and heterogeneous pathophysiology pose significant challenges to traditional single-target drug discovery. To address this, we applied the CANDO platform to identify repurposable drugs for schizophrenia using a multitarget strategy. The platform evaluates how compounds interact with the entire human proteome, generating interaction signatures that capture a compound's effect across all targets. By comparing these signatures, CANDO computes compound similarity scores and enables consensus prediction of novel therapeutics. Benchmarking experiments across all indications and specific to schizophrenia demonstrated that CANDO significantly outperformed controls across multiple evaluation metrics, recovering known drug indication associations with orders of magnitude better accuracy. Using prediction methodology validated through benchmarking, we generated a ranked list of re-purposable compounds. Literature review confirmed clinical or biochemical evidence supporting 25 top ranked drug candidates, including phenothiazine and benzamide antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. We identified protein targets with the highest likelihood of interaction with these top drugs and assessed prediction quality through overlap analysis with gold standards, showing significantly better concordance with established schizophrenia related biology than controls. Among these protein are corroborated targets such as canonical neurotransmitter receptors, dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic, as well as monoamine transporters, tyrosine aminotransferase, and lysine specific histone demethylase 1A. Enrichment of calcium-binding proteins among the phenothiazine antipsychotic triethylperazine's top predicted targets highlights a potential role for dysregulated calcium signaling, including calmodulin-CaMKK2 pathways, in schizophrenia pathology and treatment response. Another phenothiazine antipsychotic, triflupromazine, binds the serotonin transporter in addition to its canonical dopamine D2 receptor interaction, warranting further research into its potential effects on depressive symptoms. These findings demonstrate the utility of the CANDO platform in elucidating multitarget pharmacological mechanisms and accelerating the identification of effective repurposable treatments for schizophrenia.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Brendo: an open resource for uniquely transcribed genes in brain endothelial cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Beker, O., Ramezani Khorsand, F., +1 author, Mustafaoglu, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in central nervous system homeostasis, yet comprehensive transcrip- tional profiling of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) remains limited. Leveraging the increasing availability of publicly accessible bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, we developed an integrated analytical framework to identify genes selectively enriched in BMECs compared to endothelial cells (ECs) from other tissues. To address the substantial batch effects inherent to multi-source bulk RNA-seq data, we combined two differential expression strate- gies, rank aggregation methods, and extensive quality controls. Our analysis incorporated EC samples from 16 different tissues and employed robust statistical workflows to mitigate technical confounders while preserving biologically mean- ingful signals. Validation using known BBB markers and independent proteomic evidence confirmed the reliability of our approach. We present Brendo (Brain Endothelial Open Resource), an open-access web platform providing searchable, filterable, and downloadable data on differentially expressed genes in BMECs. Brendo enables an in-depth exploration of brain endothelial gene expression and offers broader applications across vascular biology by supporting cross-tissue EC com- parisons. The workflow described is adaptable to other biological contexts, promoting the systematic reuse of public bulk RNA-seq datasets for target discovery. Collectively, this resource provides a foundation for advancing BBB-targeted therapeutic strategies and highlights the value of open data integration in transcriptomic research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tumor cell dissemination is facilitated through regulatory T cell-driven extracellular matrix remodeling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Garcia-Santillan, A. D., Lichtenberg, J. Y., +13 authors, Bos, P. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Regulatory T (Treg) cells function to enforce peripheral tolerance and are potent suppressors of tumor immunity. In breast cancer, we have shown that Treg cells promote tumor growth by favoring alternative activation of macrophages via suppression of IFN-{gamma}. The tumor-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key regulator of metastatic dissemination and is emerging as a critical regulator of tumor immunity. However, the reciprocal effects of the immune system on the ECM remain elusive. Using a combination of murine in vivo, ex vivo and bioengineering models we describe Treg cell-dependent changes in the tumor ECM that facilitate tumor cell migration and metastatic dissemination. Importantly, Treg cell-dependent matrisome signatures correlate with delayed survival advantage in human breast cancer samples, and are upregulated in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Further, both IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{gamma}-sensitivity in TAMs contribute to structural and functional changes of the ECM. This work underscores a previously unrecognized role of Treg cells on the ECM that facilitates metastasis and is consistent with tissue Treg cell emergent function as critical regulators of tissue repair and cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">High-Throughput Screening Identifies PLK1 Inhibition as a Strategy to Potentiate BTK Blockade in Marginal Zone Lymphoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zadro, A., Arribas, A. J., +19 authors, Bertoni, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a key therapeutic target in B-cell lymphomas, and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). However, the rate of complete remissions is relatively low, and resistance remains a significant clinical challenge, underscoring the need for novel combination strategies. To identify compounds that enhance the activity of BTKi and overcome resistance, we conducted a high-throughput screen of 1,695 compounds using a previously developed MZL model of acquired resistance to BTK and PI3K inhibitors derived from the Karpas1718 cell line. Thirty-three compounds showed single-agent anti-proliferative activity in the nanomolar range, both in the Karpas1718-resistant and parental cells. Based on their clinical potential in combination with BTKi, seven compounds were selected for further validation. The polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor rigosertib emerged as a top candidate, showing strong activity in both parental and BTKi-resistant cell lines. Combination treatment of rigosertib and BTKi zanubrutinib resulted in broad transcriptomic changes, characterized by the downregulation of pathways involved in B-cell activation, proliferation, and BCR signaling. Mechanistically, the combination reduced phosphorylation of key BCR pathway components and inhibited NF-{kappa}B nuclear translocation. These findings suggest that PLK1 inhibition can overcome BTKi resistance by further inhibiting BCR signaling through the canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway. Therefore, the dual pharmacological inhibition of BTK and PLK1 is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with MZL and warrants further preclinical and clinical investigations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precision oncology aims to guide treatment decisions using biomarkers. While DNA-based panels are increasingly applied, RNA transcriptomics remain underused due to limited datasets and the absence of robust models. We assembled the largest transcriptomic resource for drug response prediction to date, spanning 69 cohorts, 3,729 patients, nine cancer types, and six frontline therapies: anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, BRAF inhibitors, paclitaxel, and FAC/FEC (Fluorouracil-Adriamycin-Cyclophosphamide/Fluorouracil-Epirubicin-Cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy. We developed EXPRESSO (EXpression-Profile-RESponSe-Optimizer), a supervised AI-based framework that predicts treatment response from pre-treatment transcriptomes by integrating drug targets and context-specific biomarkers. EXPRESSO achieves ROC-AUCs of 0.64--0.73 and odds ratios of 2.4--4.6 across therapies, outperforming 20 published transcriptomic signatures. Robustness analysis reveals that predictive performance plateaued for some therapies with increasing training cohorts but continued to improve for others. These findings suggest inherent limits of supervised brute-force learning for certain treatments, but additional data and deeper mechanistic modeling may further enhance transcriptomics-based predictors.</p>
