<h2 class="paper-title">Rhodo-Box: a Synthetic Biology Toolbox to Facilitate Metabolic Engineering of Rhodobacter sphaeroides</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kostanjsek, M., Raynal, A., +7 authors, Bisschops, M. M. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a purple non-sulphur alphaproteobacterium with a highly versatile metabolism. This microorganism holds promise as a chassis for sustainable biomanufacturing of numerous chemicals. Yet, its potential is constrained by a lack of standardized, well-characterized genetic elements to tune gene expression such as transcriptional promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBSs). In this study, we present Rhodo-Box, a comprehensive toolkit for R. sphaeroides created by adapting and extending the Zymo-Parts modular cloning framework. Using Rhodo-Box we built and characterized: (a) three broad-host origins of replication (pBBR1, RK2 and RSF1010), (b) a set of 13 promoters, (c) four inducible expression systems (NahR-PsalTTC, LacI-PlacT7A1_O3O4, VanR-PvanCC, and XylS-Pm), (d) 11 RBSs, and (e) four transcriptional terminators. Furthermore, we present a semi-automated, user-friendly cloning approach which enables rapid construction of R. sphaeroides strains. The Rhodo-Box toolkit equips R. sphaeroides with a standardized, automation-compatible collection of parts and workflows essential for efficient design-build-test-learn cycles and advanced metabolic engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Compound-specific DNA adduct profiling with nanopore sequencing and IonStats</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Koski, Y., Patel, D., +5 authors, Pitkanen, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Covalently bound DNA adducts are mutation precursors that contribute to aging and diseases such as cancer. Accurate detection of adducts in the genome will shed light on tumorigenesis. Commonly used adduct detection methods, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, are unable to pinpoint exact genomic locations of adducts. Long-read nanopore sequencing is an approach with the potential to accurately detect multiple types of DNA adducts at single-nucleotide precision. In this study, we developed a novel statistical toolkit, IonStats, to profile DNA adducts in nanopore sequencing data. Using IonStats, we investigated the effects of four adduct-inducing genotoxic compounds (aristolochic acid II, cisplatin, melphalan, and mitomycin C) using nanopore sequencing. Compared to untreated controls, adducted samples exhibited both shared and compound-specific perturbations in base quality scores, ionic current profiles, and read interruptions. Our study shows that nanopore sequencing can be effectively employed to detect and characterize DNA adducts, paving the way for high-resolution, high-throughput profiling of DNA damage and the exposome.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">LINKER-Pred: A Public Web Server for Accurate Prediction of Disordered Flexible Linkers in Proteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Meng, D., Glavina, J., +1 author, Chemes, L. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Disordered Flexible Linkers (DFLs) are unstructured regions that play critical roles in inter-domain communication and multivalent protein interactions. Despite their biological significance, the accurate identification of DFLs remains challenging due to limited experimental annotations and sparsity of dedicated prediction tools. Here we introduce LINKER-Pred, a publicly available web server featuring two convolutional neural network-based predictors trained on a novel large-scale dataset of linkers connecting folded domains (DLD dataset) and DisProt linkers. LINKER-Pred2 combines ProtTrans and MSA-Transformer embeddings within an ensemble CNN framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CAID2 and CAID3 benchmarks. LINKER-Pred-Lite excludes MSA-based features, improving speed while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. LINKER-Pred predictors offer robust residue-level DFL predictions directly from sequence, providing a scalable solution for DFL annotation across proteomes. The LINKER-Pred web server and associated resources are freely available at https://pcrgwd.ucd.ie/linker_pred/, offering the research community an accessible tool for studying protein disorder and modularity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProAffinity++</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, K., Di, Z., +2 authors, Bu, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that play a crucial role in living organisms. Protein-protein interactions, which govern various biological processes such as signal transduction, cell metabolism, and cell growth, are key aspect of protein function. The strength of these interactions, characterized by protein-protein binding affinity({Delta}G), is a critical thermodynamic property of protein complexes. Accurate prediction of protein-protein binding affinity is meaningful for understanding the mechanisms of biological systems and improving the speed of binding affinity determination. However, current methods are limited in their accuracy and are primarily designed for binary complexes. To address these limitations, we propose ProAffinity++, an end-to-end algorithm that predicts binding affinities using a combined representation of sequence and structure. The core idea of ProAffinity++ is to model the binding regions of protein complexes and utilize graph neural networks to capture the local microenvironment of residues. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that ProAffinity++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting protein-protein binding affinities. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable performance in challenging scenarios, such as antigen-antibody interactions and missense mutation problems, where existing methods have limitations.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metappuccino: Large Language Model-driven Reconstruction of Sequence Read Archive Metadata for Cancer Research</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hak, F., MARCHET, C., +1 author, Gallopin, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: High-throughput RNA-sequencing has significantly advanced transcriptomic profiling in oncology. Millions of RNA-seq datasets have accumulated in public databases such as the Sequence Read Archive-SRA. However, fragmented, ambiguous or missing metadata can severely limit accurate cohort selection, introduce bias and delay discoveries. Results: To address these issues, we introduce Metappuccino: a metadata enrichment tool based on a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct large language model with low-rank-adaptation (LoRA). Metappuccino can extract or infer 19 key metadata classes (e.g. organ, disease, cell type) from unstructured text. Fine-tuning was conducted with careful partitioning and training design to preserve the model's generalisation capacity, reduce data leakage, and ensure robust, context-aware inference rather than memorisation. When possible, the inferred outputs are mapped to standardised ontologies, such as Cellosaurus, Disease Ontology and Uberon, to produce consistent metadata. As a result, the fine-tuned model achieves significantly improved class prediction accuracy over the base model, performing at least as well as recent large open-source models. Furthermore, it reduces inference time by up to at least two compared to the baseline models. As a pipeline, Metappuccino complements the LLM with well-established Natural Language Processing techniques from the literature to further improve performance. By enriching the metadata of under-annotated sequences, Metappuccino creates greater value from public RNA-seq datasets, with potential applications extending beyond oncology transcriptomics. Availability and Implementation: The source code of Metappuccino is available on GitHub : github. com/chumphati/Metappuccino. The fine-tuned LLM, MetappuccinoLLModel, is available on Hugging Face : huggingface.co/chumphati/MetappuccinoLLModel. Both repositories are released under Apache-2.0 license.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">From bench assays to bedside: context-embedding transformer predicts monoclonal antibody viscosity, clearance, and regulatory success</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Virk, S. S., Virk, A. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Late-stage failures of monoclonal antibody (mAb) programs often reflect developability liabilities, including high-concentration viscosity and rapid clearance, that standard early screens only partially capture. We introduce ACeT, an attention-based context-embedding transformer that fuses routine early-stage assay readouts to predict three endpoints: high-concentration viscosity, mouse intravenous clearance, and Phase I-to-approval outcomes. On held-out mAbs, the model achieved R2 {approx} 0.75 for viscosity and R2 {approx} 0.80 for clearance, and for clinical progression reached ~78% balanced accuracy on a 112 IgG1 cohort with outcomes locked by October 2022, then 0.83 on a temporally independent set of 14 clinical-stage mAbs whose outcomes matured by May 2025. The approach outperformed single-assay heuristics and established machine-learning baselines, and model attributions recover known biophysical drivers. Retrospective portfolio simulations, under typical industry cost and success-rate assumptions, suggest that prioritising antibodies with favourable transformer scores could reduce late-stage attrition and potentially redirect up to US$ 17 billion in capital, while also lowering animal use. By unifying heterogeneous assays in a single encoder, this framework improves the fidelity of early-stage developability decisions and offers a practical route to triage viscosity and clearance risks while prioritizing mAbs with a higher likelihood of clinical progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A novel genetic strategy to interrogate an unknown phenotypic modifier: an Sdhc KO-Robertsonian mouse with a semi-homologous chromosome develops papillary thyroid carcinoma-like tumours</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bayley, J.-P., Rebel, H. G., Devilee, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme complex, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are the leading cause of the neuroendocrine tumour syndrome hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma. Pathogenic variants of SDHD and SDHAF2 confer a remarkable parent-of-origin tumour risk, in which paternally-transmitted variants cause tumours but maternally-transmitted variants do not. Formulated to explain this observation, the Hensen hypothesis proposes that loss of an (unknown) imprinted gene(s), together with the remaining wildtype SDH gene, is a prerequisite for tumour formation. This study had three objectives, first, as a test of the Hensen model, second, as a potential model for a disease for which no mouse or cell model currently exists, and finally, as a test of chromosomal configuration to interrogate large genomic regions carrying an unknown phenotypic modifier. We crossed an SDH gene knockout line to a Robertsonian (Rb) chromosome line harbouring the gene imprinting centre implicated in human tumourigenesis, to create a metacentric chromosome with characteristics of human chromosome 11. Distinct phenotypes were noted in various cohorts. In heterozygote Rb mice we noted both weight gain and frequent immune activation. In Sdhc knockout mice with both heterozygous and homozygous Rb chromosomes, thyroid abnormalities, including papillary thyroid carcinoma-like tumours, were common due to apparent synergy between the Sdhc KO and the Rb chromosome. We also found a single case of bilateral pheochromocytoma in which loss of Sdhc was not the driver. Although few studies of Robertsonian chromosomes in the mouse have addressed pathology or phenotype, this study suggests that chromosomal structure can dramatically impact clinical phenotype.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative multi-omics analysis uncovers a novel FOSL2-COL8A1-EMT regulatory axis driving colorectal cancer progression.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xingyu Zhang, Teng Yu, +6 authors, Bin Liu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis and therapeutic resistance driven in part by activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the upstream regulatory networks sustaining EMT programs in CRC are not fully understood. Here, through an integrative multi-omics strategy combining cross-cohort transcriptomic analysis, machine learning-based feature prioritization, and functional validation, we identify COL8A1, a nonfibrillar type VIII collagen, as a critical EMT effector and oncogenic regulator in CRC. COL8A1 was consistently overexpressed across independent CRC datasets and correlated with advanced tumor stage, poor patient survival, and strong enrichment of EMT-related transcriptional programs. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that FOSL2, an AP-1 family transcription factor, directly binds to a conserved high-affinity motif within the COL8A1 promoter and transcriptionally activates its expression. FOSL2 and COL8A1 exhibit strong co-expression at both mRNA and protein levels in CRC specimens, and FOSL2 silencing suppresses COL8A1 expression. Functionally, COL8A1 promotes mesenchymal phenotypes, enhances CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and promotes tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized FOSL2-COL8A1-EMT regulatory axis that fuels CRC progression and metastasis, providing novel mechanistic insights into EMT maintenance and nominating COL8A1 as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for advanced colorectal cancer.</p>
