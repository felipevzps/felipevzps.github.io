<h2 class="paper-title">Reducing haystacks to needles - ViralClust: A Nextflow pipeline to cluster viral sequences</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Triebel, S., Lamkiewicz, K., Marz, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid accumulation of viral genome sequences presents major challenges for downstream analysis tools, including tools for multiple sequence alignments, phylogeny, and genome/alignment visualization, due to computational constraints and sampling biases caused by outbreak-driven over- representation. Selecting representative genomes through clustering offers a principled alternative to random subsampling, yet choosing appropriate clustering strategies remains non-trivial and context dependent. Here, we present ViralClust, a modular Nextflow pipeline for bias-aware representative selection from large viral genome datasets. ViralClust integrates five distinct clustering algorithms (CD-HIT-EST, SUMACLUST, VSEARCH, MMSeqs2, and HDBSCAN) within a unified workflow, enabling direct comparison of clustering outcomes and flexible adaptation to diverse biological questions, considering a balanced phylogenic distribution of the selected sequences. We evaluated ViralClust on six RNA and DNA virus datasets ranging from 632 to 156,586 sequences and spanning genome lengths from 890 to 197,185 nucleotides. Across all datasets, clustering reduced dataset size by 95% or more while preserving genetic diversity across species, genera, and families, and effectively mitigating biases introduced by outbreaks, partial genomes, and sequence orientation artifacts. By supporting whole-genome clustering and scalable representative selection, ViralClust enables efficient and reproducible downstream analyses that would otherwise be computationally infeasible. Our framework provides a flexible foundation for large-scale viral genomics and supports future applications in comparative analysis and virus classification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Quantitative modeling reveals sources of variability in transcriptional activation assays</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Greenwood, M., Reardon, K. F., Prasad, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reporter cell assays, such as those used to detect estrogenic chemicals, can detect target chemicals at low concentrations and can be used to analyze chemical mixtures without a priori knowledge of the mixture components. However, the outputs of these assays are affected by biological variability, which complicates their interpretation. Here, we describe and demonstrate a workflow that is useful for determining potential sources of biological variability and optimizing the performance of cell-based assays. The workflow involves developing an appropriate mathematical model for a transcriptional activation assay, calibrating it with experimental data, and conducting sensitivity analysis to characterize individual components of the genetic circuit based on their effect on the reporter signal output. This workflow was tested using an estrogen receptor transcriptional activation assay. For this circuit, our analysis predicts that controlling estrogen response element number, promoter strength, and reporter signal degradation rates minimizes reporter output variability. We show that careful model development, calibration, and analysis can offer biologically relevant insights to minimize the variability of cell-based assays and improve genetic circuits for increased sensitivity and dynamic range.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DVPNet: A New XAI-Based Interpretable Genetic Profiling Framework Using Nucleotide Transformer and Probabilistic Circuits</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kusumoto, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This research provides an XAI-driven genetic profiling approach that may contribute to scientific discoveries in genetic research. We propose a new explainable AI (XAI) classification algorithm that combines probabilistic circuits with the Nucleotide Transformer. By leveraging the strong feature-extraction capability of the Nucleotide Transformer, we design a tractable classification framework based on probabilistic circuits while preserving decomposability and smoothness. To demonstrate the capability of this algorithm, we used the GSE131907 single-cell lung cancer atlas and created a dataset consisting of cancer-cell and normal-cell classes. From each sample, 900 gene types were randomly selected and converted into embedding vectors by the Nucleotide Transformer, after which the classification model was trained. The model demonstrated high representational capacity, achieving an accuracy of 0.97 on the training set and high robustness to unknown genetic contexts with an accuracy of 0.94 on the test set. We extracted the probabilistic contribution for each class from the tractable classification model and defined a contribution score for the cancer-cell class. Gene rankings were then created based on these scores. These rankings may reflect the inherent properties of each gene for the classification task. These analyses go beyond traditional statistical or gene-expression-level approaches, providing new academic insights in genetic research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pseudotime graph diffusion for post hoc visualization of inferred single-cell trajectories</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lukas, B. E., Pang, J., +1 author, Dai, Y. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Visual representations are widely used to interpret trajectories in single-cell data; however, they do not always faithfully capture inferred trajectory structure. As a result, interpretation of cellular dynamics and downstream analyses may be compromised. Here, we present Pseudotime Graph Diffusion (PGD), a lightweight and interpretable post hoc framework for smoothing cell-level features along pseudotime. PGD operates by performing random-walk diffusion on a pseudotime graph, propagating information along inferred trajectory paths to enhance continuity and structure. We demonstrate that PGD-smoothed embeddings improve visualization of increasingly complex inferred trajectories of monocytes and macrophages during wound healing. We further show that PGD extends naturally to trajectory-aware gene expression smoothing. By improving agreement between visual representations and inferred trajectories, PGD enables more faithful interpretation of dynamic cellular processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Accurate haplotype-resolved de novo assembly of human genomes with RFhap</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gonzalez, D., Cabas, G., +3 authors, Di Genova, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Haplotype-resolved de novo assemblies enable genome-wide separation of maternal and paternal variation, improving the interpretation of complex variants relevant to human disease. Trio-aware assemblers such as Hifiasm-Trio leverage parental short reads by deriving parent-specific k-mers to guide phasing within the long-read assembly graph; however, fixed k-mer length and heuristics cannot be optimal in the presence of sequencing errors and graph complexity in repetitive regions, contributing to phasing errors and reduced haplotype-resolved contiguity. Here we present RFhap, a trio-based long-read phasing method that integrates multi-k-mer parent-specific markers with an alignment-free k-mer lookup engine and a random forest classifier to assign long reads to maternal, paternal, or unknown haplotypes prior to de novo assembly. We benchmarked RFhap on four human trio datasets from the Human Pangenome project spanning two ONT chemistries (R10.4 and R9.4.1). Using Merqury to evaluate downstream assemblies, RFhap nearly doubled corrected haplotype NG50 (mean 24.3 Mb vs 13.1 Mb) and halved switch error rates (mean 0.111% vs 0.236%) relative to Hifiasm-Trio, while remaining competitive in consensus QV and parental k-mer completeness. Consistent with improved phasing, RFhap reduced long-switch errors by ~3-fold across datasets, particularly within interspersed repeats. Together, these results demonstrate that RFhap improves phasing accuracy from standard trio data, representing a step toward accurate and automated diploid human de novo assembly from long reads.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProMeta: A meta-learning framework for robust disease diagnosis and prediction from plasma proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, H., Gu, H., +7 authors, Zhang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The plasma proteome offers a dynamic window of human health, capturing the real-time intersections between genetics and physiology. However, the application of deep learning to proteomics is currently hindered by a reliance on large-scale labeled datasets, rendering standard models ineffective for rare or novel diseases where patient samples are inherently scarce. Here, we present ProMeta, a meta-learning framework designed to enable robust disease modeling under extreme data restrictions. By integrating knowledge-guided pathway encoding with bi-level meta-optimization, ProMeta projects unstructured proteomic profiles into biologically interpretable functional tokens. This architecture allows the model to learn a global initialization containing transferable biological priors from biobank-scale data, facilitating rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Through comprehensive benchmark experiments, ProMeta consistently outperformed transfer learning and traditional machine learning baselines in both disease diagnosis and prediction tasks. In the most challenging 4-shot scenarios (utilizing only 2 cases and 2 controls), the model achieved robust generalization with an average AUROC of {approx} 0.69, representing a 24.6% relative improvement over the best-performing baseline methods. Mechanistic investigation revealed that ProMeta disentangles cases from controls in the latent space prior to task-specific adaptation, confirming the acquisition of universal biological rules rather than rote memorization. Furthermore, gradient-based interpretation identified disease-specific protein biomarkers and functional pathways consistent with known pathophysiology. Collectively, ProMeta overcomes the data-scarcity bottleneck in precision medicine, providing a scalable, interpretable framework for characterizing the full spectrum of human diseases, particularly for rare conditions lacking extensive clinical cohorts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring protein conformational ensembles using evolutionary conditional diffusion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">cui, X., Ge, L., +4 authors, Zhang, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein conformational ensembles encode the dynamic landscapes underlying biological function, regulation, and allostery. Accurately reconstructing such ensembles while balancing conformational distributions accuracy and physical plausibility remains a fundamental challenge in structural biology, particularly when dynamic data is scarce. Here, we propose DiffEnsemble, a diffusion-based framework designed for modeling protein conformational ensembles. DiffEnsemble learns latent dynamical representations from static protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, integrated with the structural profile derived from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database as conditional guidance during the diffusion process. Benchmarking on 72 protein targets from the ATLAS molecular dynamics simulation dataset demonstrates that DiffEnsemble outperforms existing methods, including BioEmu and AlphaFLOW. Compared with AlphaFLOW, DiffEnsemble achieves improvements of 28.9% and 11.3% in Pearson correlation coefficients for ensemble pairwise root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation, respectively. Importantly, DiffEnsemble successfully captures the dominant motions for 42% of the targets. These results demonstrate that latent dynamical information embedded in static structural data can effectively support the modeling of protein conformational ensembles.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Zero-shot biological reasoning with open-weights large language models reproduces CRISPR screen based prediction of synthetic lethal interactions.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Prosz, A. G., Sztupinszki, Z., +3 authors, Szallasi, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying clinically relevant synthetic lethal interactions has great potential for uncovering novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer. Current approaches rely on machine learning models that estimate probabilities of synthetic lethal interactions, without supplying explicit knowledge of the underlying biology and lack the human-readable interpretation leading to the prediction. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new class of tools capable of reasoning and leveraging extensive biological knowledge acquired from relevant literature during their pretraining. Here, we tested multiple open-weight LLMs for their ability to predict known and novel synthetic lethal interactions. We found that most of the tested models were better at reconstructing the results of three known genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens than random chance, while observed that their performance was related to the parameter-size of the model, and on average benefited little from additional pathway and genetic information apart from what they already possess when estimating the likelihood of a synthetic lethal relationship. After selecting the best-performing and most computationally efficient model for our use case (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, 0.715 AUROC), we performed an in silico screen of 398,277 gene pairs from 893 clinically relevant genes. Our goal was to highlight the potential of open-weights LLMs as scalable, context-aware prioritization tools for synthetic lethal interactions, and to lay the groundwork for predicting higher-order genetic interactions.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advancements in deep learning technologies and an increase in medical data have enhanced the accuracy of disease diagnosis and treatment strategies. Notably, significant progress has been made in the use of deep learning-based time-series prediction models for short-term disease onset prediction and analysis of important features. However, research on explainable deep learning for long-term disease progression, such as cancer and chronic diseases, still faces challenges. The difficulty in estimating explainable gradual disease progression from observable patient test data is a key factor. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called the "deep state-space analysis framework." This framework utilizes sequentially obtained electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate and visualize temporal changes in the latent states of patients related to disease progression. It enables the clustering of latent patient states according to the severity of disease progression and identifies key factors leading to a poor prognosis with medication. To validate our framework, a detailed analysis of data from 12,695 patients with cancer was conducted. The estimated transitions of the latent states capture the clinical status of the patients and their continuous temporal changes. Furthermore, anemia was identified as a poor prognostic factor during state transitions in patients with cancer. Significant features were also confirmed, such as immune cell abnormalities, which are poor prognostic factors in patients treated with Nivolumab, Osimertinib, and Afatinib. This technological innovation deepens our understanding of disease progression and supports early treatment adjustments, prognostic evaluations, and the formulation of optimal long-term strategies. With the advancements in deep learning, its application in healthcare has even greater potential.</p>
