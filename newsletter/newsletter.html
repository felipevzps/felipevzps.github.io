<h2 class="paper-title">Perioperative tislelizumab plus lenvatinib treatment for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma at high risk of recurrence: single-arm phase II trial.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu Chen, Shujie Zhai, +9 authors, Tianqiang Song</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Postoperative recurrence significantly impacts long-term survival in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04834986), 27 patients with resectable HCC at high recurrence risk received perioperative tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) plus lenvatinib (multi-kinase inhibitor). Co-primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), median DFS, and pathologic complete response (pCR). Post-hoc exploratory machine learning analyses identified potential predictive factors. The regimen was feasible and generally well tolerated; grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7.4%. ORR was 55.6%. Among 20 patients undergoing surgery, The Median DFS was 18.8 months (20.1-month follow-up), with 1- and 2-year DFS of 74.0% and 49.8%, and 20% achieved pCR. No unexpected safety signals were observed. The post-hoc machine learning model based on Tabular Prior Data Fitted Network, comprising six pretreatment hematological measures, demonstrated classification of candidate selection in the training set (area under the curve [AUC], accuracy [ACC], and average precision [AP], all 1.0) and the test set (AUC = 0.917, ACC = 0.778, AP = 0.966). In conclusion, tislelizumab-lenvatinib is a potential perioperative regimen for resectable HCC at high recurrence risk, showing preliminary efficacy and safety.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">StomaQuant: Deep Learning-Based Quantification for Stomatal Trait Assessment</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lau, K. J. X., Chen, C.-Y., +2 authors, Naqvi, N. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stomata are microscopic pores that play a vital role in transpiration and gaseous exchange from leaf surfaces in plants. The stomatal density and size directly influence photosynthesis and hydrodynamics capacity. Conventional approaches for counting and determining stomatal density is labour-intensive and lack scalability. Although there are several AI-based stomata finder tools that were published in the last decade, existing models were trained on model plants like wheat, barley and Arabidopsis. Stomata in such model plants are generally elliptical, but applying a universal model to all plant species is not feasible due to their diverse morphological characteristics. Previous studies have suggested using the stomatal index to quantify the ratio between epidermal cells and total stomatal count. However, this approach can be difficult to apply consistently, as epidermal cell shape and size vary across plant species. Instead, we propose measuring stomatal density based on the number of stomata per total imaged pixel area in the captured images. In this study, a comparison between YOLOv12 and RF-DETR models were made for real-time stomata detection in normal and difficult-to-image and out-of-focus occluded images. The in-house training dataset consisted of images of 300 rice,100 barley and 50 sugarcane leaves that were captured against a dark background. YOLOv12 outperformed RF-DETR with higher mAP50:95 score. The models were trained with image augmentation for 300 epochs and YOLOv12 achieved a peak mean average precision of 98.5% and excelled at detecting stomata across abaxial and adaxial surfaces of leaves of both monocot and dicot plants. StomaQuant has also been shown to be effective for both epidermal peel and ethanol decolorised samples. Thus, StomaQuant can be used to effectively and efficiently estimate the stomatal density and size in a wide range of host plant species.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A unified framework enables accessible deployment and comprehensive benchmarking of single-cell foundation models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hou, S., Yang, P., +2 authors, Zhou, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent years have seen rapid growth in single-cell foundation models (scFMs), raising expectations for transformative advances in genomic data analysis. However, their adoption has been hindered by inconsistent performance across datasets, fragmented software ecosystems, high technical barriers, and the lack of best practices established through systematic, reproducible benchmarks. Here we present a unified, extensible, and fully automated computational framework that standardizes the execution, evaluation, and extension of diverse scFMs. The framework harmonizes software environments, eliminates manual configuration, and enables large-scale, reproducible evaluation across heterogeneous datasets and training regimes. Leveraging this infrastructure, we systematically benchmark thirteen foundation models alongside classical baselines across more than fifty datasets under zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. We show that pretrained embeddings capture biologically meaningful structure and provide clear advantages in low-label and transfer-learning scenarios, while classical PCA approach remains competitive or even preferable in others. Together, this work lowers technical barriers, delivers best practices, and establishes a transparent and reproducible standard for community-wide evaluation, accelerating rigorous development and adoption of scFMs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DelPi Learns Generalizable Peptide-Signal Correspondence for Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Park, J., Kim, K., +1 author, Kim, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Peptide identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics has traditionally relied on handcrafted features or simplified probabilistic approaches that limit the interpretation of structured peptide evidence. We present DelPi, an open-source peptide identification framework that learns generalizable peptide-signal correspondence from raw spectra through self-supervised pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. With model distillation enabling practical deployment, DelPi expands the interpretation of peptide evidence across data-independent and data-dependent acquisition while maintaining robust false discovery control.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">From Latent Manifolds to Functional Probes: An Interpretable, Kinome-Scale Generative Machine Learning Framework for Family-Targeted Kinase Inhibitor Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kassab, R., Krishnan, K., Verkhivker, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The design of selective kinase inhibitors remains a formidable challenge due to the high structural conservation of the ATP binding site across the kinome. While modern generative AI has enabled rapid exploration of chemical space, many advanced models operate as black boxes, obscuring the chemical rationale behind design choices and limiting interpretability. To explore these bottlenecks, we present a modular, generative framework for de novo design of SRC kinase inhibitors, integrating ChemVAE-based latent space modeling, a chemically interpretable Kinase Inhibition Likelihood (KIL) scoring function, Bayesian optimization, and cluster-guided local neighborhood sampling. The results demonstrate that kinase inhibitors spontaneously organize into a coherent, low-dimensional manifold in latent space, with SRC acting as a structural hub that enables rational scaffold transformation. Our local neighborhood sampling-based approach successfully converts inhibitors from other kinase families (notably LCK) into novel SRC-like chemotypes, with LCK-derived molecules accounting for almost 40% of high similarity outputs. Critically, we expose a fundamental representation gap: despite aromatic ring count being a top KIL feature, SMILES-based generation systematically fails to access multi-ring pharmacophores characteristic of clinical kinase inhibitors. This limitation cannot be overcome by scoring refinement alone, demanding topology aware representations. Our framework also demonstrates that unbiased exploration paired with cluster-guided sampling outperforms active-biased optimization, which traps search in narrow local optima. By exposing representational gaps and showcasing scaffold-aware navigation of latent space, this study argues for hybrid systems that combine the diagnostic transparency of interpretable machine learning frameworks with the generative power of modern architectures.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Creating bacterial genomic diversity through large-scale reconfigurations reveals phenotype robustness to organizational genome change</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Barja, M. V., Gomes de Oliveira, A., +5 authors, Llorente, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ability to generate genomic diversity expands opportunities for understanding and engineering biology. Here, we demonstrate on-demand generation of diversity in bacterial genome configurations and its application to probing physiology under altered genome organization. We engineered the fast-growing bacterium Vibrio natriegens to enable large-scale stochastic duplications, translocations, inversions, and deletions, producing populations with a wide range of genome arrangements. We investigated phenotypic robustness to genome reconfigurations and found that distinct genome organizations can support stable physiology, indicating that bacteria may tolerate chromosomal alterations more readily than previously appreciated. Our work provides a framework for advancing the understanding and engineering of bacterial genomes and suggests that genome reconfigurations may contribute to phenogenetic drift, allowing for evolutionary exploration while preserving phenotype.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A cohesin-centric gene regulatory network resource with regulatory site annotations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ding, J., Chen, H., +3 authors, Wang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cohesin is a central regulator of transcription and chromatin organization, binding to the majority of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and mediating enhancer-promoter communication through three-dimensional genome architecture. Although gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide an interpretable framework for modeling transcriptional regulation, most existing GRN analyses focus on transcription factor (TF)-gene relationships and largely ignore regulatory sites. Consequently, cohesin-associated regulatory contexts are rarely incorporated into GRN reconstruction. Here, we present a cohesin-centric gene regulatory network database that explicitly integrates TF binding, regulatory sites, and gene targets into unified TF-site-gene regulatory paths. Building upon our previously developed multiomics resource CohesinDB, we mapped TF binding to cohesin-associated regulatory sites and linked these sites to their downstream target genes. The resulting Cohesin-GRN module in CohesinDB (http://cohesindb.wangjklab.com/) (http://120.24.147.32/)comprises 61,222,502 TF-cohesin site links and 2,228,634 cohesin site-gene links, collectively forming over 270 million TF-site-gene regulatory paths. By enabling a CRE-informed and site-aware representation of gene regulation, Cohesin-GRN bridges conventional TF-gene GRNs with regulatory site-centric mechanisms. Given the pervasive roles of cohesin in enhancer activity, transcriptional control, and human disease, Cohesin-GRN provides a valuable resource for exploring transcriptional dysregulation and gene regulatory networks.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Marshall, O. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Summary: DamID, and its cell-type specific adaptations, including Targeted DamID (TaDa), Chromatin Accessibility TaDa (CATaDa) and NanoDam, are now widely-adopted as techniques for the genome-wide profiling of DNA binding proteins.

<h2 class="paper-title">AptaBLE: A Deep Learning Platform for Aptamer Generation and Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Patel, S., Peng, F. Z., +5 authors, Yao, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides that bind molecular targets with high affinity and specificity, offering significant advantages over antibodies in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, their discovery through Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) remains time-consuming, expensive, and susceptible to experimental biases. Here we present AptaBLE, a deep learning framework that combines pretrained protein and nucleic acid sequence encoders with a novel symmetric bidirectional cross-attention architecture to predict aptamer-protein binding interactions. This design enables robust generalization across diverse protein targets and ssDNA aptamer modalities while maintaining the ability to process variable-length sequences. We demonstrate that AptaBLE significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy in predicting aptamer-protein binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate two complementary de novo generation approaches that produce novel aptamers binding target proteins with desired specificity profiles and Kds as low as 31nM to-date. AptaBLE represents a significant advance in computational aptamer design, providing an accessible, sequence-based platform for accelerating therapeutic and diagnostic aptamer development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Graph-based Drug Decomposition for Anticancer Response Modeling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nasini, S., Armas, L. F. P., +4 authors, Cheok, M. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies the molecular effects on ex vivo drug response in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We firstly estimate dose--response relationships through linear and mixed-effects models, capturing both patient-specific heterogeneity and drug-level effects. Then, drug identifiers are decomposed into curated molecular descriptors and their higher-order interactions, yielding a structured, interpretable representation of chemical properties. To handle the resulting high-dimensional system, we introduce a specialized graph-based drug decomposition and selection, enabling a computationally tractable estimation of the molecular effects on ex vivo drug response. This strategy uncovers the molecular features most strongly associated with cellular viability, providing a biologically grounded and transparent alternative to black-box predictive methods. By directly linking molecular structure to therapeutic outcomes, our framework supports a novel mathematical-programming-based drug-combination selection and cost-efficient compound prioritization in pre-clinical leukemia research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Phosphorylation Protects Oncogenic RAS from LZTR1-Mediated Degradation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, L., Bolomsky, A., +8 authors, Young, R. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oncogenic KRAS and NRAS mutations are common in hematologic malignancies, but how they signal is less well characterized than in carcinomas. To uncover novel RAS biology and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we employed a multi-omics screening approach in multiple myeloma to identify regulators of RAS activity. We report that the phosphatase PP1C dephosphorylates the conserved T148 residue on RAS, which in turn permits LZTR1-dependent proteasomal degradation. Notably, LZTR1 is ineffective against KRAS A146 gain-of-function mutations, which are adjacent to T148 and prevalent in hematologic cancers. Remarkably, we find that KRAS protein is four-fold less stable in hematologic versus carcinoma cells, offering a unique therapeutic opportunity targeting RAS protein stability mechanisms. The kinases PAK1 and PAK2 shield RAS from LZTR1-dependent degradation by phosphorylating T148, and targeting PAK1/2 activity improves RAS-directed therapy. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel regulatory circuit governing RAS stability that is preferentially active in blood cancers and potentially druggable.</p>
