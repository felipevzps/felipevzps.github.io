<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting single-cell responses to novel genetic perturbations with optimal transport</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Do, C., Lähdesmäki, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The combination of pooled genetic perturbation screening with single-cell RNA-sequencing has allowed for large-scale profiling of single-cell transcriptional responses, providing valuable insights into gene function and cellular behavior. There is a need for computational methods capable of predicting single-cell responses to novel genetic perturbations, thereby allowing for the efficient exploration of the vast combinatorial space of potential multi-gene perturbations. Optimal transport (OT) presents a compelling framework to model this type of data given the lack of true control-perturbed cell pairings. However, existing neural OT models are generally constrained to the perturbations already seen in training, while the use of OT theory in methods capable of modeling novel genetic perturbations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present an OT-based method to predict single-cell transcriptional responses to novel genetic perturbations. Leveraging a flexible attention-based aggregation approach, our method integrates gene representations from multiple sources of prior knowledge, spanning from functional descriptions of genes to gene-gene relationships, producing a biologically informed representation of the perturbation. Moreover, we utilize an OT-based loss to align predicted and observed perturbed cell populations, avoiding the need to assign random control-perturbed cell pairings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the highly competitive performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further evaluations on differential expression analysis and genetic interaction modeling demonstrate the biological relevance and potential utility of our model across diverse applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">De novo protein ligand design including protein flexibility and conformational adaptation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Agamia, J., Zacharias, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rational design of chemical compounds that bind to a desired protein target molecule is a major goal of drug discovery. Most current molecular docking but also fragment based build-up or machine-learning based generative drug design approaches employ a rigid protein target structure. Based on recent progress in predicting protein structures and complexes with chemical compounds we have designed an approach, AI-MCLig, to optimize a chemical compound bound to a fully flexible and conformationally adaptable protein binding region. During a Monte-Carlo (MC) type simulation to randomly change a chemical compound the target protein-compound complex is completely rebuilt at every MC step using the Chai-1 protein structure prediction program. Besides compound flexibility it allows the protein to adapt to the chemically changing compound. MC-protocols based on atom/bond type changes or based on combining larger chemical fragments have been tested. Simulations on four test targets resulted in potential ligands that show very good binding scores comparable to experimentally known binders using several different scoring schemes. The MC-based compound design approach is complementary to existing approaches and could help for the rapid design of putative binders including induced fit of the protein target.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Linkage-aware inference of fitness from short-read time-series genomic data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Abdullah, S. M. U., Sohail, M. S., +3 authors, McKay, M. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inferring the fitness effect of mutations is a basic problem in understanding the evolution of populations over time. When multiple mutations are present in a population simultaneously, genetic linkage comes into play, and the fate of an individual mutation depends on both its fitness as well as the background on which it occurs. Accurate inference of fitness effects for evolutionary systems with multiple competing mutations is therefore contingent on resolving the confounding effects of genetic linkage, captured by the covariance between allele-pairs. Increasingly, evolutionary studies are using short-read sequencing technologies to produce detailed snapshots of evolving populations. This presents a problem as the frequencies of allele-pairs are not known beyond the read-length, hampering any attempt to resolve the effects of genetic linkage between pairs of loci residing on different reads. Here we present a computationally efficient pipeline for inferring selection from short-read time-series data with partial allele-pair frequency information, while accounting for linkage. Simulation results show that the method has good performance and is scalable to systems with several thousand variants. Additionally, we demonstrate the pipeline's utility on real datasets of within-host HIV and SARS-CoV-2 evolution, showcasing its applicability in resolving linkage effects from complex evolutionary histories.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep Learning-Driven Fragment Ion Selection for Improved Quantification in MS based Proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vu, D. T., Wallmann, G., +5 authors, Mann, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantitative proteomics relies on accurate selection of fragment ions for quantification, yet most current algorithms apply simple strategies such as median intensity or single quality filters. Modern data-independent acquisition (DIA) searches generate rich features such as fragment ion correlations, retention time and many others that could be leveraged to assess fragment quality. We introduce QuantSelect, a novel strategy to select optimal fragments by systematically integrating these features via self-supervised deep learning. QuantSelect uses a regularized, weighted-variance loss on intensity traces normalized via our directLFQ algorithm. This allows learning a fragment quality score without ground truth labels, enabling on-the-fly training on label-free DIA datasets. Integrated within our alphaDIA pipeline, QuantSelect significantly improves quantitative accuracy and in some cases substantially corrects protein intensity estimation. Sensitivity in differential expression improved by 68% in a mixed-species benchmarking dataset and by 18% in single-cell data. QuantSelect provides a practical framework for data-driven fragment selection that improves accuracy, precision and downstream inference in DIA proteomics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">resolveS: An ultra-fast, memory-efficient and reference-free tool for RNA-seq Strandedness Detection</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yu, D., Zhao, T., Xi, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Public sequencing data repositories, such as the European Nucleotide Archive and Sequence Read Archive are vital resources for biological discovery, however their associated metadata often lacks essential experimental details, specifically the strand specificity (strandedness) of RNA-sequencing data. Accurate determination of strandedness is critical for downstream analysis, yet existing tools are often limited by computational inefficiency, complex workflows, or a reliance on high-quality, species-specific reference genomes and gene annotations. To address these limitations, we developed resolveS, a rapid, resource-efficient and user-friendly tool designed to detect RNA-sequencing strandedness without requiring organism-specific genomic resources. By leveraging the evolutionary conservation of ribosomal RNA combined with a robust statistical framework, resolveS eliminates the dependency on reference genomes. Benchmarking demonstrates that resolveS outperforms existing methods in both speed and efficiency, processing samples in under 10 seconds with a minimal memory footprint (&lt;0.5 GB). Furthermore, to enhance reproducibility and facilitate seamless integration into bioinformatics pipelines, we provide ready-to-use Singularity and Apptainer images alongside a portable executable version.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Architecting cis-regulation to quantitatively tune gene expression in cereals</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Groover, E. D., Ding, D., +11 authors, Savage, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise modulation of gene expression via cis-regulatory editing holds promise for non-transgenic crop improvement, but the sequence-to-function relationships that govern plant promoter activity remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in Sorghum bicolor to systematically measure the effects of &gt;30,000 CRISPR-like mutations- deletions, substitutions, and motif insertions- across entire native promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of three photosynthesis genes: PsbS, Raf1, and SBPase. We find that gene expression is most tunable within a ~500 base pair core promoter region, where mutational effects are reproducible across biological replicates and predictive of protein output. Within these regions, we identify compact deletions and motif insertions that strongly increase protein production (&gt;30-fold relative to wild type), exceeding the performance of transgenic enhancer elements. Mutation-effect relationships are gene-specific, highlighting the need for tailored regulatory maps. Our results establish a high-throughput strategy for cis-regulatory fine-mapping that enables crop improvements via minimal, precise, and non-transgenic gene edits.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Intracellular Bismuth Coordination of Peptides and Miniproteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Brennan, A., Mason, J. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyclisation of peptides has emerged as a powerful methodology to enhance molecular stability and functional efficacy. Bismuth(III) coordination represents a particularly compact and chemoselective cyclisation modality, yet to date has remained confined to in vitro or phage-based systems. Here we report the first example of bismuth-mediated peptide and minprotein cyclisation occurring within living cells, achieved directly during recombinant expression in E. coli. Supplementation of growth media with bismuth salts enables efficient intracellular coordination of either three or six cysteine residues, yielding bicyclic and tetracyclic architectures with minimal cellular toxicity. Bis-bismuth coordination generated a tetra-cyclic minprotein with exceptional thermal and serum stability, representing a level of intracellular structural reinforcement not previously accessible. This chemistry enables the intracellular constraint of peptides and proteins and is directly compatible with genetically encoded peptide and miniprotein libraries, establishing bismuth coordination as a compact and robust modality for live-cell molecular screening.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Choi, H.-W., Lee, B., +1 author, Huh, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational workflows for MS-based proteomics remain comparatively fragmented, with heterogeneous data formats and analysis pipelines that hinder their reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse of processed data. We present msmu, an open-source Python package that implements a flexible and reproducible end-to-end pipeline for post-search data preprocessing and statistical analysis. At its core, msmu leverages the highly structured MuData format, empowering comprehensive data provenance, transparency in data sharing and reuse, and interoperability with broader Python ecosystem. Together, msmu represents a unique and significant step toward realizing the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles in computational proteomics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Exploring Disordered Regions of Human Spliceosome Proteins</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Santos, B. d. P. O., Bera, K., +3 authors, Magistrato, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introns are removed from messenger RNAs by the spliceosome, a protein-RNA machinery enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Lacking stable 3D structures, IDRs can adopt diverse conformations interlacing proteins and RNAs components of the spliceosome and regulating splicing. Here we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the human spliceosome proteome revealing that many proteins contain over 40% of disordered residues. Spliceosome IDRs are mainly driven by compositional bias due to an excess of charged and RS-like sequences, with both the nature and extent of this disorder being broadly conserved evolutionarily. Additionally, these IDRs are frequent targets of post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, and are hotspots for cancer-associated mutations, implicated in different cancer types. Our results collectively underscore central role of IDRs in splicing regulation and disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Efficient in vitro refactoring and biosynthetic gene cluster amplification for the overproduction and accelerated discovery of anticancer thioamitides</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Santos-Aberturas, J., Frattaruolo, L., +7 authors, Truman, A. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Thioamitides, a class of highly modified bacterial ribosomally synthesised and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), have potent activities against multiple cancer cell lines. Among these compounds, the structurally divergent thioalbamide combines promising in vivo antiproliferative activity with a superior chemical stability respect to its counterparts. However, thioalbamide is produced in low yields by its genetically intractable native producer and its biosynthetic pathway was initially not productive when transferred into the heterologous host Streptomyces coelicolor M1146. These circumstances substantially hamper to increase the production of this promising compound. Here, we show how in vitro Gibson-like assemblies can be employed for the quick and efficient refactoring of the thioalbamide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC), leading to substantially increased levels of production in S. coelicolor M1146 through a prioritised selection of promoters. Via this work, PtsrA and PgroEL2 were identified as beneficial additions to the Streptomyces synthetic biology toolbox. We then assessed bacterial genomes for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted to produce thioalbamide-like compounds with improved hydrophilicity. This rational discovery campaign led to the identification a silent thioamitide BGC encoding a thioalbamide-like core peptide but clustered with additional tailoring enzymes, including a previously unknown cupin-fold protein. Applying the refactoring strategy together with the simultaneous expression of multiple BGC copies, we characterised the product of this pathway, thiocupinamide, a polyhydroxylated thioamitide closely related to thioalbamide. We show that thiocupinamide has potent anticancer and antibacterial activities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhanced co-expression of cyclin F and USP7 in luminal A breast cancer correlates with endocrine resistance, high oxidative phosphorylation, and low inflammatory signatures</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sharma, S. S., P. S., H., R., N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyclin F is a non-canonical cyclin that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of the SCFCyclin F E3-ubiquitin ligase complex. By targeting specific proteins for degradation, cyclin F plays an important role in proteostasis and genomic stability. We recently showed that cyclin F interacts with USP7, a deubiquitylating enzyme. USP7-mediated stabilization of ER and PHF8 is linked to breast carcinogenesis. On the other hand, recent studies have implicated SCFCyclin F in modulating the CDK4/6-RB axis, a pathway that plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression in the HR/HER2- breast cancer. Herein, we performed an in-silico analysis to investigate the role of USP7-cyclin F axis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Cyclin F and USP7 transcripts were positively correlated across cancer cell lines and the luminal A breast cancer in the TCGA cohort. In both the METABRIC and TCGA breast cancer cohorts, high cyclin F-USP7 coexpression was synergistically associated with poor survival only in the endocrine-treated luminal A group, but not in those without endocrine treatment, suggesting an association with endocrine resistance. Notably, the transcriptomic profiles of high cyclin F-USP7 tumors were associated with signatures of endocrine resistance. Cancer Dependency Map analysis of CRISPR knockout of cyclin F or USP7 on cellular fitness suggested cyclin F influences the CDK4-RB pathway via RBL2 and/or PLK4, while USP7 might influence the ESR1-CDK4 network via HUWE1. Further, pathway analysis of differentially abundant proteins in the TCGA cohort identified enrichment of upregulated proteins in the oxidative phosphorylation and cell cycle pathways, and downregulated proteins in the immune pathways.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MYST acetyltransferases are a targetable therapeutic vulnerability in SETBP1-mutant leukemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Maxson, J. E., Braun, T. P., +12 authors, Padron, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutations in SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1) are associated with an adverse prognosis in myeloid malignancies. These mutations stabilize SETBP1 protein, driving increased expression of a progenitorassociated gene expression program through incompletely described mechanisms. A proteomic screen revealed interactions between SETBP1 and members of the MYST acetyltransferase complexes, including the catalytic subunits KAT6A and KAT7. Mutant SETBP1 increases the localization of MYST complexes at known SETBP1 target genes, including the Hoxa cluster, where it drives increased histone acetylation and gene expression. Treatment of SETBP1D868N expressing myeloid progenitors with MYST inhibitors reduced target gene expression. To establish the efficacy of MYST inhibition in vivo, we treated mice harboring a syngeneic SETBP1-mutant leukemia with the clinical-grade MYST inhibitor PF-9363. This resulted in complete hematologic control and increased survival. MYST inhibition was also highly effective against a SETBP1-mutant PDX model. These studies identify MYST acetyltransferases as promising therapeutic targets in SETBP1-mutant malignancies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting GL-Lect driven endocytosis to suppress cell plasticity in breast cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fardin, A., Benvenuto, A. F., +26 authors, Sigismund, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aberrant endocytosis has long been associated with epithelial plasticity and tumorigenesis, but direct in vivo evidence of its causal role in tumor progression and metastasis has been lacking. Here, we identify and molecularly characterize a previously unrecognized form of E-cadherin (ECAD) internalization in mammary epithelial cells. This process is mediated by the endocytic adaptor Epsin 3 (EPN3) through glycolipid-lectin (GL-Lect) driven endocytosis requiring galectin-3 and Eps15-family adaptors. Leveraging an EPN3 knock-in mouse model, we show that dysregulation of GL-Lect driven endocytosis disrupts mammary gland morphogenesis and activates epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), synergizing with the ERBB2/Neu breast oncogene to drive metastasis. Pharmacologic inhibition of the GL-Lect mechanism suppresses morphogenetic and invasive phenotypes ex vivo, providing proof-of-concept for therapeutic targeting. These findings establish the GL-Lect mechanism as a driver of metastatic plasticity and uncover a tractable vulnerability in BC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A deep learning and large language hybrid workflow for omics interpretation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dachao Tang, Chi Zhang, +15 authors, Yu Xue</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Profiling molecular panorama from massive omics data identifies regulatory networks in cells but requires mechanistic interpretation and experimental follow up. Here we combine deep learning and large language model reasoning to develop a hybrid workflow for omics interpretation, called LyMOI. LyMOI incorporates GPT-3.5 for biological knowledge reasoning and a large graph model with graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The large graph model integrates evolutionarily conserved protein interactions and uses hierarchical fine-tuning to predict context-specific molecular regulators from multi-omics data. GPT-3.5 then generates machine chain-of-thought (CoT) to mechanistically interpret their roles in biological systems. Focusing on autophagy, LyMOI mechanistically interprets 1.3 TB transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic data and expands the knowledge of autophagy regulators. We also show that LyMOI highlights two human oncoproteins, CTSL and FAM98A, for enhancing autophagy upon treatment with disulfiram (DSF), an antitumour agent. Silencing these genes in vitro attenuates DSF-mediated autophagy and suppresses cancer cell proliferation. Strikingly, DSF treatment with Z-FY-CHO, a CTSL-specific inhibitor previously used for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, potently inhibits tumour growth in vivo.</p>
