<h2 class="paper-title">Genolator: A Multimodal Large Language Model Fusing Natural Language, Genomic, and Structural Tokens for Protein Function Interpretation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Danner, M., Islam, T., +4 authors, Krause, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Decoding the genetic code to unveil its genome functionality is a monumental task which would greatly advance the understanding of disease mechanisms and development of targeted treatment approaches. Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing across diverse domains, translating the complex language of DNA into human-readable form remains challenging due to genomic data complexity and unexplored regions of the human genome. Current (genomic) language models either have a solid understanding of natural language or of the genomic code. Models fusing both aspects are largely lacking. Results: Here we present Genolator, a multimodal large language model that integrates embeddings from DNA sequences, amino acid sequences, and protein structures with natural language queries. Fine-tuned on over 370,000 question-answer pairs generated using abstracted Gene-Ontology (GO) terms, Genolator effectively answers queries regarding protein subcellular localization, molecular function, and biological processes. Evaluation demonstrates high accuracy in confirming or denying protein function associations, outperforming baseline models such as openly available allrounder LLMs like GPT 4.1 as well as smaller domain specific models integrating knowledge from foundation models like Evo2 and ESM-2. Explorations of the Genolator's hidden states unveil a biologically and linguistically plausible organization of its learned representations. Conclusion: Genolator enhances accessibility to genomic information by enabling natural language interaction with protein data, facilitating biological discovery, and clinical research. It represents a step towards bridging genomic code and human language through the integration of a multimodal LLM.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Denoising image-based spatial transcriptomics data with DenoIST</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kwok, A. W. C., Vannan, A., +3 authors, McCarthy, D. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Image-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) technologies provide unprecedented resolution of gene expression in tissue sections, but suffer from contamination of cells' gene expression profiles due to imperfect cell segmentation. We present DenoIST (Denoising Image-based Spatial Transcriptomics data), a new computational tool that accurately identifies and removes contaminating transcripts from IST datasets. DenoIST models the observed transcript counts using a Poisson mixture model that explicitly accounts for local neighbourhood contamination. Applied to multiple real IST datasets of varying cell densities, DenoIST restores gene expression specificity and clarifies local biological structures by identifying and filtering transcripts spilt over from neighbouring cells. The denoised data enable more consistent and interpretable cell type annotation by minimising conflicting gene expression profiles, reducing the prevalence of hybrid or ambiguous cell types, and enhancing the contrast between distinct functional compartments. Overall, we demonstrate that DenoIST can be integrated to existing IST analysis workflows to improve biological interpretability and robustness of IST data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PMGen: From Peptide-MHC Prediction to Neoantigen Generation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Asgary, A. H., Aleyasin, A., +4 authors, Soeding, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) present peptides to T cells, playing a central role in adaptive immunity against cancer and infections. Accurate structural modeling of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is essential for developing personalized immunotherapies. Existing tools often focus on either MHC class I or II, support limited peptide lengths, and address isolated tasks such as pMHC binding prediction or structure modeling. We introduce Peptide MHC Generator (PMGen), an integrated framework for predicting, modeling, and generating peptides across both MHC classes and a broad range of peptide lengths. PMGen enhances AlphaFold predictions by incorporating anchor residue information into structural module. PMGen achieves high structural accuracy (mean peptide core RMSD: 0.54 A for MHC-I, 0.33 A for MHC-II), improving over the state of the art for both MHC classes. PMGen can also generates diverse, high-affinity peptides with minimal structural deviation and accurately models the impact of single-point mutations in benchmark neoantigen-wild-type pairs. PMGen is a versatile tool for advancing personalized immunotherapy and is freely available at https://github.com/soedinglab/PMGen.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Elucidating the conformational dynamics of the mitochondrial localization signal, M3, of TDP-43 and accessing potential inhibitors using molecular docking and simulation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Balaji, R., Joshi, H., Patel, B. K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aberrant mitochondrial localization of the RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which may affect mitochondrial dynamics and contribute to neuronal toxicity. Inhibitors of the cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 were reported previously, but their effect on the mitochondrial mis-localization of TDP-43 and the mitochondrial function remains to be investigated. Three internal peptide sequences from TDP-43, M1, M3, and M5, were found to enable TDP-43's mitochondrial localization and competitive inhibition using these peptides thwarted mitochondrial import of TDP-43 and rescued TDP-43-induced cytotoxicity to neurons. Here, we performed a virtual in silico screening of 2115 FDA-approved small molecules for affinity against the M3 region of TDP-43 (aa: 146-150) that lies in the RNA recognition motif-1 (RRM1) domain. Multiple all-atom MD simulations were carried out starting with two different conformations of the tandem RRMs to understand the dynamics of the target M3 region in explicit solvent water. The analysis of the simulation trajectories suggests that the M3 region is relatively non-flexible and buried relative to the other regions of the tandem RRM1-2 domains. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), from virtual screening, docked consistently with the M3 region in different docking strategies even amidst the region's poor solvent accessibility. Vitamin D3 also remained stably bound to the M3 region in most frames of four replica MD simulations, each of one microsecond. Taken together, our study proposes vitamin D3 as a potential binder to the M3 region which may inhibit the pathogenic mitochondrial mis-localization of TDP-43.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Kinetic modeling of continuous meta-fermentation quantifies metabolic activity in a complex microbial system</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Koga, T., Kajimoto, K., +5 authors, Tashiro, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> One of the serious drawbacks of a complex microbial system is the difficulty in quantifying the metabolic activity of each microorganism. A kinetic model of predominant microbial species was constructed for continuous meta-fermentation in a complex microbial system at several dilution rates (D). The introduction of biomass and lactic acid inhibition terms improved model accuracies at D = 0.05 h-1 and 0.4 h-1, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) improved from 0.577 and 5.21 to 0.972 and 0.759, respectively, with the inhibition term at D = 0.05 h-1. The inhibition terms resulted in good R2 (0.996) and RMSE (1.27) values at D = 0.4 h-1. By solving the Michaelis-Menten equation in the constructed models, the species flux (SF) was calculated to estimate the metabolic activity (formation and consumption) of each microorganism. At D = 0.05 h-1, Caldibacillus hisashii contributed to lactic acid production at 0.333 g/L/h, whereas Clostridium cochlearium consumed lactic acid at 0.203 g/L/h, suggesting cross-feeding of a metabolite. It is therefore possible to account for consumption that cannot be considered in gene-derived calculations, indicating that this is a promising analytical method for investigating the dynamic behavior of complex microbial systems. Kinetic models for continuous meta-fermentation at several D values were developed. A new metabolic analysis method is proposed to estimate the activity of microbial species in a complex microbial system.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mechanistically Interpretable Toxicity Prediction Through Multimodal Integration of Structure and Transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cattebeke, G., Vermeersch, A.-S., +2 authors, Nieuwerburgh, F. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in computational toxicology increasingly emphasize the need for models that deliver both scalable predictive performance and mechanistic insights. Nevertheless, most approaches fall short of capturing the underlying mechanisms that drive toxicity. Herein, we describe a scalable multimodal modeling framework that integrates chemical fingerprints with high-throughput transcriptomic dose-response profiles across three human cell lines to predict activity for 41 curated Tox21 assay endpoints. Using gradient-boosted decision trees and nested compound-aware cross-validation, 13 assays achieved robust performance (mean AUPRC &gt; 0.75), spanning nuclear receptor signaling, stress-response pathways, and xenobiotic metabolism. SHAP-based feature attribution analysis showed that predictions depend on both structural motifs and transcriptional programs, in a manner consistent with established mechanistic relationships between chemical structure, nuclear receptor biology, and adaptive cellular responses. These findings illustrate how structure-HTTr dose-response signature integration enables models that are accurate and mechanistically grounded, shifting computational toxicology toward transparent and biologically informed chemical risk evaluation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Tuning a Genetic Circuit with Double Negative Feedforward Loops to Approximate Square Waves</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wu, J., Johnson, C., Yeung, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise temporal control of gene expression is important for programming cellular functions. Existing circuits, however, often couple amplitude and duration. This prevents independent tuning of key dynamic features. We therefore set out to design a genetic system capable of generating square-wave outputs with externally programmable geometry. To achieve this, we constructed a layered regulatory design that separates production and removal into two independently controlled modules. An activating input turns expression on and builds the reporter. A repressing input stops synthesis and removes existing protein. Together, these actions confine the active window and produce square-wave outputs or pulses on demand. Waveform geometry depends on input dose and timing. Analysis of limiting cases reveals that strong repression compresses dynamic range, and finite degradation capacity restricts decay rate. Enhancing removal capacity alleviates this bottleneck and sharpens the off-transition. Together, this work establishes a general framework for programming gene-expression dynamics with independently tunable amplitude and duration.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unified modeling of cellular responses to diverse perturbation types</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, C., Wei, L., Zhang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Predicting cellular responses to perturbations is essential for understanding gene regulation and advancing drug development. Most existing in silico perturbation models treat perturbation-cell interactions with simplistic fusion strategies that overlook the hierarchical nature of regulatory processes, leading to inaccurate predictions and poor generalization across perturbation types. We present X-Pert, a universal in silico perturbation model that explicitly captures both gene-perturbation interactions and gene-gene dependencies through attention mechanisms. X-Pert flexibly handles diverse perturbation inputs across different types and combinations, and quantitatively models their dosage- and efficacy-dependent effects, all within a unified representation space. This enables accurate prediction of unseen, combinatorial, and dose- or efficacy- dependent responses of various perturbation types. Across benchmarks spanning genetic and chemical perturbations, X-Pert consistently demonstrates superior performance at both gene and pathway levels. Moreover, its unified representation space enables downstream analyses such as perturbation retrieval and druggene association discovery. By integrating data across perturbation types, experimental platforms, and cell contexts, X-Pert establishes a versatile and generalizable foundation for in silico perturbation, enabling broad applications in biological and therapeutic discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Time-resolved phylogenomics analysis reveals patterns in biosphere nutrient limitation through Earth history</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ni, Z., Osborn, T., +8 authors, Anderson, R. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The co-evolution of life and Earth has profoundly transformed global biogeochemical cycles over the past 3.5 billion years. These cycles, in turn, have dictated the availability of essential nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron, thereby affecting primary productivity and the scale of the Earth's biosphere. Despite the critical role of nutrient limitation in shaping the size and scope of the biosphere, significant uncertainties persist about which nutrients were globally limiting at various points in Earth history. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to trace the origin and spread of genes associated with nutrient limitation over time. We show that genes associated with phosphorus limitation emerged relatively early in life's history, whereas genes associated with nitrogen limitation emerged later, closer to the Great Oxidation Event. In terms of iron limitation, we present novel evidence that siderophores, compounds that facilitate iron uptake, may have arisen as early as the Archean. Overall, our results have important implications for understanding how the geosphere has influenced the scale and extent of life on Earth for the past 4 billion years.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NLRP12-mediated Glioblastoma-Astrocyte Cross-talk Promotes Tumor Growth</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rajkhowa, S., Meena, D., +6 authors, Jha, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLR) are cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that regulate inflammation by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). NLRP12 is a cytosolic protein with inflammation-promoting and inflammation-attenuating properties. NLRP12 exhibits tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting effects that may be cancer, cell-type, context-dependent, aided by differences in the microenvironment contributing to the pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, colitis-associated cancer, and glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a grade IV malignant brain tumor with poor patient survival and high tumor recurrence due to a heterogeneous cell population and angiogenesis. Our previous research reported NLRP12 as a potential prognostic marker for GBM with high expression in GBM patient tissues. In the present study, we investigated the role of NLRP12-mediated signalling between GBM and tumor-adjacent astrocytes, using a comprehensive panel of experimental models, including LN-229 GBM and SVG astrocyte cell lines, cell line-derived spheroids, patient-derived primary glioma cells, and patient-derived glioma organoids. We report that NLRP12 deficiency reduces cell proliferation and viability in the LN-229 cells, but increases these parameters in SVG cells. Furthermore, NLRP12-deficient LN-229 cells display attenuated ability to form three-dimensional spheroids, indicating a role of NLRP12 in anchorage-independent growth, which is considered a hallmark of tumorigenicity. Analysis of patient-derived glioma tissue and patient-derived GBM organoids revealed differential expression of NLRP12. Our findings suggest that NLRP12 modulates GBM cell proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent growth in a cell-context dependent manner. The cell-type-specific roles of NLRP12 may underlie its complex contribution to GBM pathophysiology with implications for therapy and prognosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Mass Spectrometry-Based Interactome Study on Anisomelic Acid and Its Effects on HPV16 E7</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Santos Silva, M., Coelho-Rato, L. S., +5 authors, Eriksson, J. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven epithelial cancers rely on actions of viral oncoproteins, notably E7, which disrupts cell cycle control through inactivation of the tumor suppressor pRb. While prophylactic vaccines prevent infection, effective therapeutics for existing HPV-associated malignancies remain lacking. Here, we investigate the natural diterpenoid anisomelic acid (AA) and its mechanism of promoting HPV16 E7 degradation. Using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we demonstrate that AA binds to E7, increasing its thermal stability and suggesting a direct molecular interaction. Mass spectrometry-based interactome analysis revealed that AA treatment reshapes the E7 interactome, enriching for E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR4, TRIP12, TRIM28), the scaffold protein SQSTM1, and HSP40/HSP70 chaperone complexes involved in protein quality control and misfolded protein signaling. These data support a model in which AA binding induces conformational changes in E7 that enhance its recognition by ubiquitin-proteasome and chaperone-mediated degradation pathways. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into AA's antiviral mode of action and highlight its potential as a lead compound for targeted degradation of HPV oncoproteins.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The cumulative impact of passenger mutations on cancer development</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nayak, A., Chan, C., +1 author, Georgakopoulos-Soares, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The traditional binary classification of somatic mutations in cancer as either drivers or passengers overlooks the potential cumulative impact of smaller-effect mutations. Here, we analyze 2,263 whole-genome-sequenced primary tumors across 31 cancer types to assess the functional contribution of passenger mutations in cancer development. We find that in the absence of canonical driver mutations, passenger mutations in cancer genes are significantly enriched, exhibit higher predicted pathogenicity, and are associated with aberrant expression, splicing disruption, altered transcription factor binding, and clinical outcomes that resemble those in the presence of driver mutations. The accumulation of passenger mutations in tumor suppressor genes correlates with significantly reduced expression and poorer prognosis, mirroring the functional outcomes of driver mutations. Notably, this is a previously uncharacterized mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation, in which the accumulation of somatic mutations results in its progressive inactivation. Our results support a continuum model of mutational impact, where the collective influence of passenger mutations contributes to oncogenesis and clinical outcomes. This work advocates for integrative cancer models that incorporate all somatic mutations to more accurately reflect the complexity of tumor evolution.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine learning-based screening and validation of pyroptosis-associated prognostic genes and potential drugs in cervical cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zongchen Hou, Guiju Tang, +2 authors, Lufang Wang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pyroptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death, but its mechanism in the development of cervical cancer has not been elucidated. Cervical cancer differentially expressed pyroptosis-related genes were identified via bioinformatic analysis Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE7803, GSE9750, GSE63514 and GSE67522. The correlation between the expression of pyroptosis-related genes in normal cervical tissue and cervical cancer tissue was analyzed through the TCGA database. Using LASSO regression algorithm to establish a prediction model for the obtained genes related to pyroptosis. Exploring the functions of differentially expressed genes through GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Using PPI network analysis to screen hub genes, using CIBERSORT method for immune infiltration analysis of prognostic genes, and finally predicting drug-gene interactions in DGIdb database. A total of 19 pyroptosis-related genes were screened from the GEO dataset of cervical cancer tissues, revealing their regulation of endopeptidase activity, inflammation response, positive regulation of cytokine production and cellular response to environmental stimuli. LASSO regression algorithm was used to establish prediction models for 7 of these genes, and 3 pyroptosis-related genes (SPP1, VEGFA, and CXCL8) closely associated with the prognosis of cervical cancer were identified. qRT-PCR confirmed that compared with normal cervical tissue, the expression of SPP1, VEGFA, and CXCL8 was increased in cervical cancer (P&lt;0.05). SPP1, VEGFA, and CXCL8 are most closely related to macrophages, Th2, and neutrophils, respectively. 148 potential targeted drugs targeting key genes were predicted, providing a possible basis for predicting the prognosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Knocking down SPP1 can inhibit cell proliferation and migration in cervical cancer cells in vitro. In conclusion, our study has identified key genes related to pyroptosis in cervical cancer, which potentially become effective clinical prognostic biomarkers, and further research is needed to explore their underlying mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Revealing new associations between lncRNAs and diseases through cross attention mechanism and multiple level feature fusion.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xueming Luo, Xiaoling Li, +1 author, Yan Jiang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Revealing new lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) is necessary to decipher pathological mechanisms and find new clues of diagnosis and therapy for complex diseases. However, experimental methods for LDA identification need a significant amount of time and cost. Here, we introduce a novel deep learning-based method, LDA-CAMF, to infer LDA candidates. LDA-CAMF first designs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically decode high-order interdependencies between lncRNAs and diseases, presents a multi-level feature fusion strategy to aggregate hierarchical node representations learned from different layers, and then fuse the original features and the optimized representations to enhance the model expressive ability, finally captures novel LDAs using XGBoost. In comparison with six state-of-the-art methods (SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF, LDASR, LDA-VGHB, and GEnDDn), LDA-CAMF computed the highest AUCs of 0.9632 and 0.9759, and the best AUPRs of 0.9369 and 0.9783 on lncRNADisease and MNDR under 5-fold cross validation, respectively. Under "cold-start" scenarios for lncRNAs and diseases, LDA-CAMF outperformed the above six baselines under most conditions. Five ablation studies further validated better predictive performance of LDA-CAMF. Visualization of LDP feature distributions also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed LDP feature learning strategy. Case studies elucidated that HNF1A-AS1 and BCYRN1 associated with prostate cancer, and HAR1A linked with diabetes. We forecast that LDA-CAMF assists in biomarker identification and mechanism investigation of complex diseases.</p>
