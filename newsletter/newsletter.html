<h2 class="paper-title">FrustrAI-Seq: Scaling Local Energetic Frustration to the Protein Sequence Space</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Leusch, J.-P., Poley-Gil, M., +4 authors, Heinzinger, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins fold into their native three-dimensional (3D) structures by navigating complex energy landscapes shaped by the biophysical and biochemical properties of their sequence. Once folded, some sequence positions (dubbed residues) remain locally frustrated, reflecting functional constraints incompatible with optimal packing. This local energetic frustration provides important insights into protein function and dynamics, but its analysis typically relies on structure-based energy calculations and remains energetically costly at scale. Here, we introduce an ultra-fast sequence-based prediction of local energetic frustration directly from protein sequences using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs). Our method, coined FrustrAI-Seq, enables proteome-wide frustration profiling in minutes (17 minutes for the entire human proteome on a single Nvidia H100 GPU) while retaining biologically relevant performance as shown for the alpha-globin and beta-lactamase family. By eliminating the need for explicit structural or evolutionary information, this approach expands frustration analysis to protein regions and classes that were previously inaccessible, including intrinsically disordered regions and high-throughput de novo designed protein datasets. To support reproducibility and large-scale applications, we provide the largest freely available resource of precomputed local frustration scores to date (10^6 proteins), along with model weights and complete training and inference code at: github.com/leuschjanphilipp/FrustrAI-Seq.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Neretva: Unsupervised Neural Variational Inference for Allele-level Genotyping of Highly Polymorphic Genes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhou, Q., Ahmadi, S. P., Numanagic, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate genotyping and phasing of highly polymorphic gene families are essential for precision medicine. Yet, the genotyping problem remains computationally challenging due to extreme sequence similarity between related genes, copy number variation, and structural complexity. Current methods typically rely on integer linear programming or maximum likelihood-based approaches that often suffer from scalability and flexibility issues. Here, we present Neretva, a new framework that models the genotyping problem as an instance of a hierarchical probabilistic model based on auto-encoding variational Bayes (AEVB). Leveraging the reparameterization strategy and neural inference networks, our approach scales efficiently to complex pharmacogene families such as CYP (cytochrome P450) and KIR (killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors), and achieves improved accuracy over the current state of the art on both CYP and KIR gene families. Neretva is open source and is freely available at https://github.com/0xTCG/neretva.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deconvolving mutation effects on protein stability and function with disentangled protein language models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ding, K., Li, Z., +2 authors, Luo, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how evolutionary constraints shape protein sequences is fundamental to deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying protein stability and function, which has broad implications in protein engineering and therapeutics development. Recent advances in protein language models (pLMs) have enabled accurate prediction of mutation effects through evolutionary information, effectively capturing the selective pressure that governs protein sequence variation. A critical challenge, however, remains in disentangling the intertwined mutation effects on protein stability and function, as evolutionary signals conflate both stability-driven and function-driven pressures, obscuring the mechanistic basis of mutation effects and limiting their utility for rational protein engineering. In this work, we introduce DETANGO, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly deconvolves the mutation effects on protein functions by removing components attributable to stability perturbations from the pLM-predicted mutation effects. Guided by computational or experimental stability measurements, DETANGO estimates a functional plausibility score for each single-point mutation that is the component of the mutation effect not accounted for by changes in stability. Single-point mutations with low functional plausibilities are predicted to be stable-but-inactive (SBI) variants, whose compromised activities are caused by direct perturbations on functional mechanisms rather than structural stability. Residues enriched for such variants are inferred to be functionally critical, as indicated by the strong evolutionary pressures to maintain protein function. Through extensive benchmarking experiments, we show that DETANGO accurately identifies SBI variants and pinpoints functionally important residues across contexts, including ligand binding, catalysis, and allostery. Moreover, extending DETANGO from individual proteins to homologous protein families reveals shared and distinctive functional patterns across protein families. Collectively, these results establish DETANGO as a biologically grounded framework for disentangling evolutionary constraints on protein stability and function, advancing mechanistic understanding of protein function, and informing rational protein engineering.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Using a GPT-5-driven autonomous lab to optimize the cost and titer of cell-free protein synthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Smith, A. A., Wong, E. L., +39 authors, Thavaraj</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We used an autonomous lab, comprising a large language model (LLM) and a fully automated cloud laboratory, to optimize the cost efficiency of cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). By conducting iterative optimization, the LLM-driven autonomous lab was able to achieve a 40% reduction in the specific cost ($/g protein) of CFPS relative to the state of the art (SOTA). This cost reduction was accompanied by a 27% increase in protein production titer (g/L). Iterative experimental design, experiment execution, data capture and analysis, data interpretation, and new hypothesis generation were all handled by the LLM-driven autonomous lab. The interface between OpenAI's GPT-5 LLM and Ginkgo Bioworks' cloud laboratory incorporated built-in validation checks via a Pydantic schema to ensure that AI-designed experiments were properly specified. Experimental designs were translated into programmatic specification of multi-instrument biological workflows by Ginkgo's Catalyst software and executed on Ginkgo's Reconfigurable Automation Cart (RAC) laboratory automation platform, with human intervention largely limited to reagent and consumables preparation, loading and unloading. By integrating LLMs with programmatic control of a cloud lab, we demonstrate that an LLM-driven autonomous lab can successfully perform a real-world scientific task, highlighting the potential of AI-driven autonomous labs for scientific advancement.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Scalable probe-based single-cell transcriptional profiling for virtual cell perturbation mapping and synthetic biology phenotyping</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Swinderman, J. T., Tung, P.-Y., +17 authors, Gilbert, L. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large-scale single-cell transcriptional phenotyping of genetic perturbations (perturb-seq) links genes to phenotypes and should enable virtual cell predictive modeling and cellular engineering. However, current perturb-seq single-cell methods are costly, information sparse and require barcodes for many applications. We developed ProPer-seq, a perturb-seq method that uses multiplexed custom DNA probe panels to measure and phenotype synthetic biology perturbations at single-cell resolution without barcodes, including multidomain proteins and sgRNAs. ProPer-seq faithfully reproduces gold-standard perturb-seq phenotypes while achieving 4-fold cost reduction and 50% increased gene detection per cell. As a scalable fixed-cell profiling method, ProPer-seq enables atlas-scale profiling for virtual-cell initiatives and demonstrates data quality suitable for training and validating predictive models. Lastly, ProPer-seq's targeted detection of modular transgenes enables library-on-library perturbation profiling of combinatorial synthetic protein design spaces. We applied this to 3,550 sgRNA x dCas9 effector combinations as well as 260 CAR x ORF combinations dynamically profiled in primary T cells, revealing principles of transcriptional control and cell state modulation by multidomain synthetic transgenes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">How many are you? Open data and bioinformatics reveal species misidentification and potential introgression in Chordodes (Phylum Nematomorpha)</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">De Vivo, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The potential usage of genomic open data can help us to understand patterns in biodiversity. They can also be helpful for identifying morphologically similar species. An example of taxon in which this can be useful is Nematomorpha, one of the less studied animal phyla, for which data has started to be available recently and where species identification can be hard. In this study, I planned initially to evaluate the usage of mitochondrial data for population analyses using an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset labelled as belonging to Chordodes fukuii . After surprising results using extracted sequences from the barcoding gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI), I evaluated species delimitation using a mix of a previously released double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) SRA dataset plus the RNA-seq one. PCA, R analyses through adegenet and ADMIXTURE confirmed the presence of two species in the RNA-seq dataset, which should be labelled as C. formosanus and C. japonensis; however, some individuals labelled as C. japonensis according to COXI clustered with C. formosanus specimens or had some C. formosanus ancestry when more data was used, indicating potential introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. The study shows how previously released data can be used for evaluating species delimitation, potential previous demographic events and potential needs in DNA barcoding and genomics for avoiding future misidentification of morphologically similar species.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ABFormer: A Transformer-based Model to Enhance Antibody-Drug Conjugates Activity Prediction through Contextualized Antibody-Antigen Embedding</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Katabathuni, R., Loka, V., +1 author, Kondaparthi, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational screening is increasingly becoming a crucial aspect of Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) research, allowing the elimination of dead ends at earlier stages and concentrating on potential candidates, which can significantly reduce the cost of development. The current state-of-the-art deep learning model, ADCNet, usually considers antibodies, antigens, linkers, and payloads as distinct features. However, this overlooks the complex context of antibody-antigen binding, which is primarily responsible for the targeting and uptake of ADCs. To address this limitation, we present ABFormer, a transformer-based framework tailored for ADC activity prediction and in-silico triage. ABFormer integrates high-resolution antibody-antigen interface information through a pretrained interaction encoder and combines it with chemically enriched linker and payload representations obtained from a fine-tuned molecular encoder. This multi-modal design replaces naive feature concatenation with biologically informed contextual embeddings that more accurately reflect molecular recognition. ABFormer outperforms in leave-pair-out evaluation and achieves 100% accuracy on a separate test set of 22 novel ADCs, while the baselines are severely miscalibrated. Ablation study confirms that the predictive capability is predominantly driven by interaction-aware antibody-antigen representations, while small molecule encoders enhance specificity by reducing false positives. In conclusion, ABFormer provides a reliable and efficient platform for early filtering of ADC activity and selection of candidates.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Decoding ATG9A Variation: A Comprehensive Structural Investigation of All Missense Variants</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Utichi, M., Marjault, H.-B., +1 author, Papaleo, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular recycling pathway that requires different ATG (autophagy-related) proteins to generate double-membraned autophagosomes. ATG9A, a multi-spanning membrane protein, plays a crucial role in this process as the only transmembrane component of the core autophagy machinery. ATG9A functions as a lipid scramblase, redistributing lipids between membrane leaflets for the expanding autophagosome membrane. Structural studies have revealed that ATG9A forms a homotrimer with an interlocked domain-swapped architecture and a network of internal hydrophilic cavities. This configuration underlies its role in lipid transfer and membrane remodeling together with the lipid transporter ATG2A. ATG9A dysfunction has also been linked to human disease, as specific ATG9A mutations cause neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative phenotypes. Additionally, ATG9A is altered in cancer, promoting pro-tumorigenic traits. However, most missense variants in ATG9A remain uncharacterized, posing a significant challenge for interpreting genomic data. In this study, we employed in silico saturation mutagenesis approach using the MAVISp (Multi-layered Assessment of VarIants by Structure) framework to predict the impact of every missense mutation in ATG9A. By analyzing multiple structural assemblies of ATG9A (monomer, trimer, and the ATG9A-ATG2A complex), we evaluated diverse mechanistic indicators of variant impact, including protein stability, long-range conformational changes, effects on multimerization interfaces, and alterations in post-translational modifications. We integrated the structure-based predictions with Variant Effect Predictors from recent deep-learning or evolutionary-based models and cross-referenced known variants catalogued in ClinVar, COSMIC, and cBioPortal. Finally, we predicted mechanistic indicators for all possible variants with structural coverage not yet reported in the disease-related databases supported by MAVISp. Our analyses identified a group of potentially damaging variants in ATG9A and the possible molecular mechanisms underlying their effects. Together, this work provides a roadmap for interpreting missense variants in autophagy regulators and highlights specific ATG9A mutations that deserve further investigation in the context of human disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PRISM: Niche-informed Deciphering of Incomplete Spatial Multi-Omics Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mu, S., Wang, Z., +10 authors, Cai, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial multi-omics data, characterizing the knowledge of diverse molecular layers, have become indispensable for the in situ analysis of tissue architecture and complex biological processes. Nevertheless, current spatial multi-omics sequencing protocols are often hindered by incompatible protocols, resulting in incomplete spatial multi-omics pairing due to inconsistent field-of-view or spatial resolution. To address this, we present PRISM, a novel computational method tailored for this scenario. PRISM leverages a niche-informed graph to propagate information from paired to unpaired regions, jointly achieving the spatial domain identification and spatial omics imputation. Extensive benchmarking on five diverse simulated and real experimental datasets demonstrated that PRISM outperformed existing methods in spatial multi-omics analysis tasks. Application to the human Parkinson's disease data revealed that PRISM accurately recovered dopamine-associated spatial domains and metabolite distributions masked by incomplete data gaps. PRISM offers a robust solution for bridging the integration gap inherent in incompatible sequencing protocols, thereby facilitating more accurate downstream biological interpretation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MosaicLev: Modified Levenshtein distance for mobile element-aware genome comparison</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Stoltz, H. K., Kuhlman, T. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Somatic genetic mosaicism arises when genomes diverge across cells during development, in part due to the activity of transposons (cut-paste) and retrotransposons (copy-paste). Standard sequence comparison methods are not motif-aware, penalizing mobile element insertions based on length rather than recognizing them as single biological events. Results: We introduce a modified Levenshtein distance (mlev) that discounts mobile element insertions via a tunable parameter (m in [0, 1]). Validation on 67 Cluster G1 mycobacteriophage genomes demonstrates bidirectional discrimination between Mycobacteriophage Mobile Element 1 (MPME1) and MPME2 elements: using MPME1 as target yields 49% discount for MPME1 carriers but only 9% for MPME2 carriers, while using MPME2 reverses this pattern. This approach classifies 35 MPME1 carriers and 11 MPME2 carriers, and identifies 14 phages showing low discount with both motifs, consistent with absence of both elements.

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Assemblies that combine chemotherapeutics with tumor-targeting proteins are promising agents for treating resistant cancers but require full biochemical characterization before therapeutic deployment. We developed and optimized a HER3 targeting capsomere, HPK2.0, which forms stable nanoscale assemblies with cytotoxic corroles via electrostatic neutralization and shape complementarity. These nanocomplexes exhibit durable serum stability, HER3 dependent tumor invasion, and efficient endosomal escape, resulting in potent and selective cytotoxicity in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. In an orthotopic metastatic TNBC model, systemic treatment with HPK2.0 corrole assemblies achieved 67 to 83% tumor regression, near-complete suppression of spontaneous lung metastasis, and a ~2 fold improvement in survival relative to mock treatment, with minimal off-target toxicity. By integrating tumor specificity with therapeutic potency, this next-generation protein corrole platform establishes a clinically scalable strategy for treating metastatic HER3 positive TNBC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">LIMK Inhibition and Metformin Block Mitochondrial Transfer Overcoming Macrophage Driven Therapy Resistance in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nwarunma, E., Miari, K. E., +21 authors, Wheadon, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemoresistance is a major contributor to poor clinical outcomes in AML patients and can arise from interactions between AML cells and the bone marrow microenvironment (BME). How immune cells, particularly macrophages (M{varphi}s), facilitate this process requires better clarification. This study shows that M2-like M{varphi}s protect AML cells from apoptosis induced by daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C). This protection occurs via co-culture and is linked to enhanced mitochondrial transfer from M{varphi}s to AML cells. M{varphi}s interacted with AML cells via tunneling nanotube (TNT)-like structures. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial transfer using cytochalasin B reduced the protective effect, indicating that mitochondria mediate this process. M{varphi}s transferred functional mitochondria to AML cells as evidenced by enhanced metabolic capacity and reduced reactive oxygen species levels in AML cells under chemotherapy stress. TH-257 (LIMK inhibitor) and metformin blocked mitochondrial transfer and M{varphi}-driven chemoprotection. Moreover, increased transcript expression levels of RhoC and cofilin correlate with inferior overall survival in AML patients. These findings suggest that M2-like M{varphi}s contribute to chemoresistance through TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer and the LIMK-Cofilin pathway, identifying potential therapeutic targets to circumvent chemoresistance in AML.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">JAK-STAT Pathway Heterogeneity Governs Immunotherapy Response in Breast Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhou, J., Zhang, H., +2 authors, Peng, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The JAK-STAT pathway (JSP) is a well-known oncogenic cascade; however, recent clinical trials have detected JSP upregulation in breast cancer following anti-PD1 immunotherapy. This paradoxical observation warrants further investigation into JSPs intercellular heterogeneity, tumor dynamics, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications for immunotherapy. JSP expression showed dynamic shifts during breast cancer progression, with higher levels in T cells and para-cancerous epithelial cells. In tumor cells, elevated JSP highly correlated with malignant phenotypes. JSP-high tumor cells overexpressed oncogenic pathways, while exhibiting increased immunosuppressive signaling via MIF-CD74 signaling axis. In T cells, higher JSP levels were associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity, improved differentiation, and reduced exhaustion, reflecting robust anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of immunotherapy datasets revealed that higher JSP levels were associated with improved responses towards PD-1 inhibitors, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, with JSP serving as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy sensitivity. As a key JSP component, STAT4 exerts dual roles in breast cancer: it drives tumorigenesis in malignant cells, sustains breast epithelial cell proliferation, and bolsters T cell anti-tumor functionality--while also acting as a highly accurate biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response. This indicates that JSP targeting demands a nuanced approach: broad inhibition may impair anti-tumor immunity, and optimized therapeutic strategies paired with precise biomarkers are critical to maximize JSPs utility in breast cancer immunotherapy. Our findings highlight JSPs functional heterogeneity in epithelial, tumor, and T cells, with high JSP activity correlating with enhanced immunotherapy efficacy in breast cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhancing Transcription Factor Regulatory Network Analysis through Data Balancing and Representation Learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xuan Tho Dang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factor (TF) and target gene interactions are pivotal in gene regulatory networks, influencing molecular biology and disease mechanisms, particularly cancer. Dysregulated TFs contribute to aberrant gene expression, driving tumor progression. While experimental methods like ChIP-seq and RNA-seq provide valuable insights, their high cost and scalability constraints necessitate computational alternatives. Machine learning offers promising solutions, yet data imbalance remains a major challenge affecting predictive accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach integrating K-means++ clustering with a data balancing strategy to enhance TF-target interaction prediction. By selecting low-frequency TFs within clusters based on an inverse information principle, our method mitigates data bias and improves model generalization. Additionally, we incorporate deep learning with random walk sampling and skip-gram embeddings to extract informative representations of heterogeneous biological networks. Experimental results using five-fold cross-validation demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.9452 ± 0.0047. Our framework enhances predictive accuracy while addressing data imbalance, offering significant applications in molecular biology and biomedical research for TF-target gene discovery and therapeutic development. .</p>
