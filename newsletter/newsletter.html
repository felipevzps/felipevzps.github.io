<h2 class="paper-title">How Much Does Protein Structure Really Help? A Case Study in Mutation-Induced Stability Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Moldwin, A. R., Shehu, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multimodal neural networks integrating protein language models (PLMs) with structure-derived features are increasingly common for predicting mutation effects, yet fundamental mechanisms remain poorly characterized. In this paper, we articulate and address two key questions: (i) do these architectures exploit mutation-conditioned structural changes, and (ii) does structure provide additive value over PLM-learned sequence embeddings afterall? Using melting temperature shift prediction as a controlled testbed, a phenotype expected to depend strongly on three-dimensional geometry, we introduce generalizable diagnostic methodologies: systematic channel ablations quantifying each modality's marginal contribution, and context-radius probing, a novel technique restricting inputs to progressively larger neighborhoods around mutations to spatially localize predictive signal. Across ten independent runs per condition, we find PLM embeddings dominate: removing structure causes minimal performance change, while removing PLMs causes performance collapse. Context-radius probing reveals signal is highly localized; mutation-site-only models recover full-context performance. Critically, comparing wild-type-shared versus mutation-conditioned structural regimes reveals no systematic gain from geometric perturbations, demonstrating that current representations function as static fold priors because downstream featurization attenuates mutation-induced changes. However, structure helps selectively: benefits concentrate in variants with atypical PLM embeddings occupying phenotypically incoherent neighborhoods where sequence-derived priors are locally unreliable. Though focused on a controlled testbed, this work surfaces a key challenge for any protein prediction task where domain knowledge suggests structure should matter: not whether to "add structure," but how to represent and integrate geometry so that it contributes distinct signal beyond strong sequence priors. We provide architecture-agnostic diagnostics to test and quantify when and how explicit structure delivers that added value.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatial transcriptomic profiling of decalcified murine musculoskeletal samples via Xenium Prime 5K</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lammlin, L., Tran, H. X., +7 authors, Maerz, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Successful generation of high-quality spatial transcriptomics data from murine musculoskeletal tissues has been impeded by the challenge of preserving RNA integrity through the harsh tissue processing steps required for histological sectioning. In particular, the need to thoroughly fix and decalcify mineralized tissues has proven problematic. We detail a comprehensive sample processing pipeline for three common murine musculoskeletal tissue samples, enabling high-quality transcript detection via imaging-based spatial transcriptomics using the Xenium Prime 5K platform from 10x Genomics. Our protocol outlines methodological details for transcardiac perfusion, fixation, decalcification, paraffin processing, and a sample co-embedding strategy facilitating anatomically consistent and simultaneous sectioning of multiple samples onto the spatial transcriptomics slide. Rigorous quality control demonstrates high-quality tissue-specific outcomes across intact knee joints, tibiae, and lumbar spines from adult mice. Our pipeline enabled 70-91% high-quality transcripts across synovium, meniscus, patellar tendon, articular cartilage, subchondral bone, cortical bone, bone marrow, muscle, fracture callus, and dorsal root ganglion tissues. The average number of detected transcripts varied markedly between tissue types - soft tissues such as synovium, patellar tendon, muscle, bone marrow, and callus exhibited ~200 - 400 transcript per cell; mineralized tissues such as subchondral bone, meniscus, and cortical bone exhibited ~ 13 - 150 transcripts per cell; highly active neuronal tissues such as dorsal root ganglion neurons yielded 750 - 1100 transcripts per cell. Canonical cell markers within each tissue confirmed successful identification and representation of key cell types. Through rigorous sample quality assessment at multiple stages of processing, this protocol yields high-quality RNA transcript detection while preserving critical anatomical context and will serve as a valuable tool enabling spatial transcriptomic profiling of intact musculoskeletal tissue samples.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">FHIR as a Unifying Format for Genomic Research Data Tracking, Aggregation, and Integration</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sanati, N., Walsh, B., +5 authors, Ellrott, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing complexity of genomic research demands standardized data sharing and integration. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification has become a well-established standard for exchanging data among health data systems. While designed primarily for clinical and patient data in health care environments, it also has applicability to represent genomic research data and offers a path for aggregating and integrating extremely rich datasets that have traditionally remained siloed and disparate. To study this potential, we developed FHIR Aggregator, an integration of seven major biomedical repositories, including the Genomic Data Commons, GTEx, HTAN, and DepMap, that covered 142334 patients, 819251 specimens, 1096491 observations and 711166 documents. We explore the various ways the FHIR standard can be applied to structure genomic research data and enable new possibilities. We demonstrate how FHIR can be used, where it succeeds or falls short, and which concepts must be extended to better support large-scale clinical and genomics research projects.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Large generative mRNA language foundation model for efficient coding sequence generation and design with mRNA-GPT</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bian, B., Zhang, Y., +2 authors, Saito, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> mRNA design plays a central role in synthetic biology, nucleic acid therapeutics, and vaccine development. Although large language models are applied in many biological fields, generative language models for de novo mRNA design remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce mRNA-GPT, a series of generative mRNA language models which for the first time covers the three domains of life as pretraining datasets. Based on a GPT-2 transformer architecture with 302 million parameters, we pre-trained three separate models on 19,676 bacterial, 4,688 eukaryotic, and 702 archaeal species, leveraging 80 million, 83 million, and 2 million mRNA coding sequences, respectively. Distinct clustering of mRNA coding sequence embeddings from animals, plants, and fungi in the pretrained mRNA-GPT-eukaryote indicates that the model captures organism-specific sequence features. Following unsupervised pre-training, we fine-tuned mRNA-GPT on a translation-efficiency dataset to generate high-performance mRNA sequence. Compared to the pretrained model, the fine-tuned mRNA-GPT produced mRNA sequences with significantly higher translation efficiency scores, demonstrating the ability of mRNA-GPT to capture sequence features underlying high translation efficiency. We further fine-tuned mRNA-GPT on datasets for mRNA stability and mRNA expression, where it likewise produced high-performance mRNA sequences. Our pretrained models are publicly available, enabling other researchers to adapt mRNA-GPT to specialized tasks such as tissue-specific mRNA expression or stability by fine-tuning on their own data. Together, our study demonstrates that generative mRNA language modeling as a promising approach for accelerating mRNA design across diverse biological fields.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NW-flex: flexible-block sequence alignment for short tandem repeats</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yu, Z., Levy, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aligning sequencing reads to short tandem repeats (STRs) is challenging because repeat copy number often differs from the reference, and small changes inside and around the repeat can yield many competing alignments. We introduce NW-flex, a simple extension of classical sequence alignment that addresses this problem. NW-flex takes a reference with a designated internal block and identifies the best-scoring alignment while allowing that block to contract to any shorter substring. Apart from this substring choice, the alignment obeys the usual substitution scoring and gap constraints. For STRs, we design the flexible block with enough repeat copies to accommodate any expected repeat count, so the algorithm contracts the reference to match the read while keeping the flanks fully constrained. NW-flex requires only a small modification to the Needleman-Wunsch/Gotoh algorithm, adds minimal computational overhead, and preserves optimality under classical scoring. We provide open-source Python and Cython implementations, worked examples, and notebooks that reproduce the figures and validate correctness against baseline alignments.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modular metagenomic analysis of pan-domain symbioses with MAGUS</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Al-Ghalith, G. A., Ryon, K. A., +11 authors, Tierney, B. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metagenomic analysis of deeply sequenced, eukaryotic-dominant symbiotic communities can be difficult for many metagenomic workflows. Here, we present MAGUS, a bioinformatic toolkit that uses a suite of custom bioinformatic methods for iterative genome assembly and filtering of pan-domain communities, where eukaryotes, bacteria, viruses, and functionally annotated gene catalogs are resolved and analyzed over a series of interconnected, modular software components. We evaluated MAGUS using deeply sequenced (median depth: 579 million reads) ten samples of hard corals, soft corals, and hydrozoans, which comprise complex, eukaryote-dominated symbiotic communities. We successfully resolved phylogenetically comparable host (N = 10), algal (N = 6), bacterial (N = 55), and viral (N = 160,925) genomes, as well as a gene catalog comprising 15,369,684 non-redundant genes (7.6% functionally annotated). MAGUS is available on GitHub (https://github.com/two-frontiers-project/2FP_MAGUS/).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">R2G2: A Python-R Framework for Seamless Integration of R/Bioconductor Tools into Galaxy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">joshi, j., cumbo, f., Blankenberg, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> R is widely used in statistical computing, data analysis, and bioinformatics. A key contributor to its success in bioinformatics and computational biology is the open-source project Bioconductor. As of its latest release (3.20), the Bioconductor community offers 2,289 software packages for biomedical research, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Given R's growing importance, integrating R and Bioconductor tools into platforms like Galaxy enhances accessibility, reproducibility, and scalability in bioinformatics workflows. The Galaxy Toolshed provides multiple tools leveraging R and Bioconductor packages. Additionally, various open-source public Galaxy servers, such as usegalaxy.org and usegalaxy.eu, already host several R and Bioconductor-based tools, highlighting the importance of past integration efforts. However, given the vast number of available packages, the full potential of R and Bioconductor within the Galaxy ecosystem remains underutilized. Galaxy's web-based interface makes these powerful tools more accessible to researchers without programming expertise, fostering broader collaboration. Despite its advantages, integrating R packages into Galaxy can be complex. It requires XML wrappers to define inputs, outputs, and parameters, which can be time-consuming. Managing dependencies from CRAN and Bioconductor, resolving installation issues, and ensuring compatibility across different package versions further complicates the process. Many tools also require custom scripting, creating a steep learning curve for non-programmers. To address these challenges, we have developed a tool that automates the generation of Galaxy wrappers for R packages. This eliminates the need for manual XML writing, reduces complexity, and saves time. Our tool provides an intuitive interface for creating Galaxy-compatible tools without programming expertise and automates dependency management for seamless execution. Bioconductor has revolutionized bioinformatics, with thousands of researchers relying on its tools. Automating its integration into Galaxy removes technical barriers, democratizing access to advanced bioinformatics tools and workflows. Our solution bridges the gap between R-based analysis and user-friendly, scalable tools, ultimately advancing research accessibility and scientific discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Queryome: Orchestrating Retrieval, Reasoning, and Synthesis across Biomedical Literature</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Punuru, P., Ibtehaz, N., +3 authors, Kihara, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has made comprehensive manual synthesis increasingly difficult to perform effectively, creating a pressing need for AI systems capable of reasoning across verified evidence rather than merely retrieving it. However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods often fall short when faced with complex biomedical questions that require iterative reasoning and multi-step synthesis. Here, we developed Queryome, a deep research system consisting of specialized large language model (LLM) agents that can adapt their orchestration dynamically to a wide range of queries. Using a hybrid semantic lexical retrieval engine spanning 28.3 million PubMed abstracts, it performs iterative, evidence-grounded synthesis. On the MIRAGE benchmark, Queryome achieved 88.98 % accuracy, surpassing prior systems by up to 14 points, and improved reasoning accuracy on the biomedical Humans Last Exam (HLE) subset from 15.8% to 19.3%. Moreover, in a task for constructing a review article, it earned the highest composite score in comparison with Deep Research from OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, and Scite.AI, reflecting its strong literature retrieval and synthesis capabilities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Predictive design of tissue-specific mammalian enhancers that function in vivo in the mouse embryo</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">CHEN, S., Loubiere, V., +5 authors, Stark, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enhancers control tissue-specific gene expression across metazoans. Although deep learning has enabled enhancer prediction and design in mammalian cell lines and invertebrate systems, it remains unclear whether such approaches can operate within the regulatory complexity of mammalian tissues in vivo. Here, we present a general strategy for designing tissue-specific enhancers that function reliably in mice. We use deep learning to train compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on genome-wide chromatin accessibility and fine-tune them via transfer learning on validated human and mouse enhancers. Guided by these models, we design fifteen synthetic enhancers for the heart, limb, and central nervous system (CNS) in mouse embryos, all of which are active in their intended target tissue. Our work establishes a generalizable framework for programmable control of mammalian gene expression in vivo, opening new avenues in functional genomics, synthetic biology, and gene therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PTEN-loss confers dependence on the guanylate synthesis enzyme IMPDH in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Padder, R., Le Le, T., +8 authors, Valvezan, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is common in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and is associated with poor prognosis. PTEN-loss drives robust activation of AKT/mTORC1 signaling to promote leukemic cell growth. We find that PTEN-loss in T-ALL confers dependence on the guanylate nucleotide synthesis enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) for cell growth and viability. This metabolic vulnerability is dependent on sustained mTORC1 signaling and can be exploited using clinically approved IMPDH inhibitors to selectively kill PTEN-deficient T-ALL cells, and extend survival in genetic and xenograft T-ALL models in mice. Mechanistically, IMPDH inhibitors cause early DNA replication stress, followed by DNA damage. In contrast to treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors, these events culminate in robust and selective cell death in PTEN-deficient T-ALL cells. These findings reveal a targetable metabolic vulnerability in T-ALL, which could provide rationale for repurposing clinically approved IMPDH inhibitors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine perception liquid biopsy identifies brain tumours via systemic immune and tumour microenvironment signature.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dana Goerzen, Mijin Kim, +11 authors, Daniel A Heller</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The detection and identification of intracranial tumours is limited by the lack of accurate biomarkers and requires invasive biopsy procedures. We investigated a machine perception liquid biopsy approach to detect and identify intracranial tumours from peripheral blood and to discover biomarkers responsible for the predictions. Quantum well defect-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes stabilized with single-stranded DNA, interrogating 739 plasma samples from brain tumour patients, were used to train and validate machine-learning models to detect intracranial tumours with 98% accuracy and identify tumour type. The protein corona of the top model-contributing nanosensor was interrogated using quantitative proteomics, resulting in the identification of tumour ecosystem-secreted factors, both previously reported and newly discovered, originating from intracranial tumour cells, the tumour microenvironment and the innate immune system of patients with glioblastoma and meningioma. Newly discovered factors elicited linear nanosensor responses and were elevated in one or both tumour types, matching the original protein corona enrichment. This investigation reveals that a perception-based detection of disease in blood can identify biomarkers responsible for the signal and also amplify cancer detection signals by detecting factors beyond tumour cells, thereby recruiting the entire tumour ecosystem for cancer diagnosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unraveling tissue-specific molecular targets of dihydroartemisinin in non-small cell lung cancer: an integrative machine learning and network pharmacology approach.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Qiang Zhou, Erdong Shen, +8 authors, Qinghua Yin</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents significant therapeutic challenges due to resistance and immune evasion. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a derivative of artemisinin, exhibits broad anti-tumor activity, but its molecular targets and mechanisms in NSCLC remain unclear. To identify the core therapeutic targets and elucidate the mechanism of action of DHA against NSCLC using an integrated computational and bioinformatics approach. Potential DHA targets were predicted using PharmMapper, SEA, SwissTargetPrediction, SuperPred, and TargetNet. NSCLC-associated targets were retrieved from OMIM, GeneCards, and CTD. Transcriptomic datasets (GSE101929, GSE118370, GSE116959, GSE159857) were integrated and analyzed for differential expression (limma) and co-expression networks (WGCNA). KEGG pathway enrichment identified key pathways. Protein-protein interaction networks, machine learning (Lasso regression, Random Forest), nomogram construction, immune infiltration analysis (ssGSEA), miRNA-mRNA network analysis (miRTarBase), and molecular docking (CB-Dock2) were performed to identify and validate core targets. We identified 1277 potential DHA targets and 44 consensus NSCLC targets. Integration of DEGs (1240 genes) and WGCNA modules (3 key modules, 2860 genes) yielded 1128 overlapping genes. KEGG enrichment revealed 15 key pathways. Machine learning on 196 pathway-enriched DHA targets identified 12 candidate genes. Validation confirmed 6 core targets: AR, CASP3, CDK1, CDK4, PTK2, MMP9. A nomogram based on the 12 targets showed excellent predictive power (AUC = 0.987). Immune profiling revealed significant alterations in 21 immune cell types in NSCLC, and correlation analysis linked core targets (e.g., CDK1/CDK4 with T cell subsets, MMP9 with myeloid cells) to immune dysregulation. Molecular docking confirmed strong binding affinities between DHA and all 6 core targets, with CDK1 exhibiting the highest affinity (- 8.8 kcal/mol). miRNA networks identified key regulators like hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-302a-3p. This study delineates AR, CASP3, CDK1, CDK4, PTK2, and MMP9 as core therapeutic targets of DHA in NSCLC. DHA exerts its anti-NSCLC effects through direct inhibition of these targets (particularly high-affinity binding to CDK1) and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, including T-cell memory, cytotoxic function, myeloid-mediated remodeling, and immunosuppressive cell subsets. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for developing DHA as a therapeutic agent or adjuvant for NSCLC, especially in combination with immunotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An Immune Nanoenhancer Revitalizes Chemotherapeutics to Tailor Tumor-Derived dsDNA for Anticancer Immunoengineering.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yiming Liu, Yachao Li, +6 authors, Xianghui Xu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment; however, most current strategies target only isolated steps of the cancer-immunity cycle and therefore struggle to achieve durable clinical success. Central to immune surveillance, the cGAS-STING pathway orchestrates innate and adaptive responses by promoting dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and durable immunological memory. However, chemotherapeutic activation of this axis remains elusive due to a paucity of safe, efficacious, and translatable inducers of tumor-derived double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Here, we report a rationally engineered immune nanoenhancer platform-C-iNE/A, that reprograms approved chemotherapeutics to initiate robust dsDNA-driven cGAS-STING activation in tumors even at low drug doses. Guided by machine learning, we optimize chemotherapeutic encapsulation and combine it with photophysically triggered mild hyperthermia to impair DNA repair while sparing healthy tissues. This cascade promotes intratumoral dsDNA accumulation, immunogenic release, and sustained immune activation. C-iNE/A elicited potent immune responses across tumor models, enhancing dendritic cell maturation, amplifying cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, suppressing metastasis, and establishing memory T cell populations. Our approach establishes a generalizable strategy to convert conventional chemotherapeutics into immune activators at safe drug doses, offering a clinically relevant platform to overcome current limitations in STING-based immunotherapy and advance the next generation of tumor-immunomodulatory regimens.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A machine-learning informed circulating microbial DNA signature for early diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yuan Li, Caiming Xu, +11 authors, Ajay Goel</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has seen a dramatic rise in incidence in developed countries over the past three decades. Early detection of its precursors-gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) is critical for cancer prevention. This study presents the development and validation of a novel liquid biopsy assay based on circulating microbial DNA (cmDNA) for the early detection of EAC and HGD. Using metagenomic sequencing, we identified significant differences in microbial diversity and composition between EAC and HGD patients, as well as between BE and GERD patients. A total of 46 microbial candidates in tissue and 419 in serum were upregulated in EAC &amp; HGD, with 11 consistently elevated in both sample types. Following qRT-PCR validation and LASSO regression, a 6-marker cmDNA panel was selected. This signature was incorporated into a diagnostic model trained with the XGBoost algorithm, achieving an AUC of 0.93 in the training cohort (52 HGD &amp; EAC cases vs. 54 BE &amp; GERD controls). Importantly, the model demonstrated robust performance in an independent testing cohort (23 HGD &amp; EAC cases vs. 22 BE &amp; GERD controls), yielding AUCs of 0.91 for EAC and 0.88 for HGD. These findings highlight the diagnostic potential of cmDNA-based profiling and support its utility as a minimally invasive, accurate, and generalizable tool for early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p>
