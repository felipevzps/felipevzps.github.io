<h2 class="paper-title">Engineered probiotics that sequester arsensite in a mouse gastrointestinal system</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nguyen, N., Wang, M., +5 authors, Chan, C. T. Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic remains a major global health concern, as arsenite is frequently present in contaminated food and drinking water and readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Once internalized, arsenite accumulates in tissues and contributes to long-term health effects, including cancer, organ dysfunction, and neurological disorders. Despite extensive efforts to reduce environmental contamination, there are currently no practical strategies to prevent dietary arsenite from entering the human body during digestion. Here, we report a synthetic biology-based approach that uses engineered probiotics to detect and sequester arsenite directly within the GI tract before systemic absorption occurs. We engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a probiotic strain, to function as a living arsenite-interception system. Central to this design is an arsenite-responsive genetic toggle switch that activates chelator expression upon exposure and sustains production under biostatic conditions, while automatically shutting off during active cell division to limit metabolic burden and enhance biosafety. In parallel, we engineered an arsenite-binding protein derived from the transcriptional regulator ArsR to eliminate DNA-binding activity while retaining high-affinity metal binding, yielding a non-toxic chelator suitable for intracellular sequestration. The resulting engineered strain efficiently removed arsenite from its surrounding environment in vitro while maintaining robust cell viability and growth. To translate these findings to an in vivo context, we developed a mass-transfer model describing arsenite distribution among the stomach lumen, engineered bacteria, and epithelial cells. This model guided the selection of a bacterial dose predicted to substantially deplete lumenal arsenite prior to epithelial uptake. Using this strategy, we demonstrated in a mouse GI model that oral administration of engineered EcN markedly reduced arsenite entry into the bloodstream compared with wild-type EcN or no-bacteria controls. Together, these results establish a programmable probiotic platform for intercepting dietary arsenite and highlight a potential strategy for preventing absorption of environmental toxicants using living microbial therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AFsample3: Generating and selecting multipleconformational states with Alphafold3</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kalakoti, Y., Wallner, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurately capturing the conformational diversity of proteins is essential for understanding their mechanisms and regulation. However, current structure prediction approaches, including AlphaFold derivatives, are largely limited to modeling one dominant conformation. Improved sampling methods have expanded this to predicting two states. Here, we present AFsample3, an enhanced sampling framework built upon AlphaFold3 that substantially improves the generation and selection of diverse protein conformations. Across a benchmark of 238 non-redundant proteins with multiple experimentally determined states, AFsample3 significantly outperforms AlphaFold3 and its predecessor AFsample2 by improved predictions for 28% (67/239) of targets ({Delta}TM &gt; 0.1) while degrading only 3% (8/239), and increases the number of high-quality alternate-state models (TM &gt; 0.8) by 54% (from 54 to 83; p 0.1) while degrading only 3%, and increases the number of targets with high-quality predictions (TM &gt; 0.8) by over 50% compared to standard AlphaFold3. Ensemble diversity is also markedly enhanced (p &lt; 0.0001), enabling accurate modeling of potential intermediate and or additional states. These results demonstrate that the improved sampling in AFsample3 can capture multiple native-like conformations, representing a significant advance in modeling of protein conformational landscapes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of an epigenetically and phenotypically distinct peritumoral glioblastoma cell population linked to inferior patient outcome</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Neves, I., Lu, X., +11 authors, Uhrbom, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive and therapy-resistant primary brain tumor with dismal prognosis. Lethality is in most patients caused by a local peritumoral (Edge) relapse near the resection cavity. This region is insufficiently studied and experimental models are scarce. We have analyzed matched tissue samples and cell cultures from bulk tumors and Edge regions of 11 GB patients. Genomic profiling displayed similar genetic alterations and subclonal distributions of matched bulk and Edge regions. Functional, phenotypic and combined single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses showed distinct differences between bulk and Edge GB cells with similar shifts across patients. Sn multiomics uncovered a subset of Edge cells defined by unique chromatin accessibility signatures and elevated mesenchymal and immune gene expression. Integrated computational and functional investigations converged on microglia-derived Oncostatin-M as a driver of the Edge-unique phenotype, and high expression of Edge-related signatures correlated with inferior patient outcome in independent GB cohorts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Menin maintains enhancer-promoter interactions in a leukemia-specific manner</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sharlandjieva, V., Chahrour, C., +13 authors, Milne, T. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inhibition of the protein-protein interaction between Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein and the adapter protein Menin is a promising therapy for both high-risk MLL-rearranged and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) acute leukemias. However, the exact function of Menin in transcription regulation remains unclear, limiting our understanding of the utility of Menin inhibitors. Here, we compared the transcriptional responses of MLL-AF4 and NPM1c leukemias to Menin inhibition. We observed broad, acute transcriptional dysregulation in MLL-AF4 cells, whereas NPM1c showed few targets directly regulated by Menin binding. Screening for Menin interacting proteins by co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry revealed a greater enrichment for transcriptional regulators and elongation factors in MLL-AF4 cells compared to NPM1c cells, pointing to protein complex and cell context-specific activity. Finally, we used high-resolution Micro-Capture-C to demonstrate that Menin regulates intragenic enhancer activity and maintains enhancer-promoter contacts in MLL-AF4 cells but not in NPM1c cells. Together, our findings show that Menin exerts distinct transcriptional effects depending on the protein complex it associates with, which is key to understanding how patients respond transcriptionally to Menin inhibition in distinct disease contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Human Recombinant Antibody Against DRP1 Serine 616 Phosphorylation Enables Detection of BRAFV600E-Associated Mitochondrial Division in Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nizard, S. T., Chen, Y., +11 authors, Chipuk, J. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continuously undergo balanced cycles of fusion and division to meet cellular demands. Mitochondrial division is mediated by Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1), a cytosolic large GTPase whose phosphorylation at serine 616 (DRP1-S616) promotes its translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane and organelle division. Dysregulated, mitochondrial division disrupts cellular homeostasis and contributes to disease pathogenesis, including cancer. Our prior work demonstrated that the oncogene-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway constitutively phosphorylates DRP1 at serine 616 (DRP1-S616), which is essential to cellular transformation and correlates with oncogene status in patient tissues. Similarly, DRP1-S616 is subject to pharmacologic control by targeted therapies against oncogenic MAPK signaling. Building upon this foundation, we developed a human recombinant monoclonal antibody with high specificity for DRP1-S616, referred to as 3G11. Using diverse biochemical platforms, we demonstrate the robust utility of 3G11 to detect DRP1-S616 in melanoma cell extracts and isolated organelles. Immunofluorescence revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of oncogenic MAPK signaling reduces DRP1-S616 levels which correlates with mitochondrial hyperfusion; while immunohistochemistry showed that elevated DRP1-S616 expression in human tissues correlates with BRAFV600E disease. Together, these findings establish 3G11 as a specific, versatile, renewable, and cost-effective tool for studying mitochondrial division, with strong potential for clinical applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inhibition of HVEM suppresses invasion and growth of mesenchymal glioblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tanabe, R., Westermark, B., +1 author, Miyazono, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mesenchymal glioblastoma is a subtype of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) characterized by pronounced inflammatory features and resistance to conventional therapies. Proneural GBM acquires a mesenchymal phenotype through proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT), in which NF-{kappa}B signaling plays a central role. Through RNA-sequencing analysis of glioma-initiating cells (GICs), we found that expression of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM, also known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 14 or TNFRSF14) is highly expressed in mesenchymal GBM cells. Functional analyses revealed that HVEM promotes GIC proliferation, neurosphere formation, and invasive capacity in vitro, and enhances tumor formation following intracranial transplantation of GICs in mice. Among the TNF superfamily ligands, APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand, also known as TNF superfamily 13 or TNFSF13) binds to HVEM and activates NF-{kappa}B signaling, thereby inducing a mesenchymal phenotype in GBM cells. To therapeutically target this pathway, we have generated nanobodies from camelid-derived heavy-chain-only antibodies against human HVEM. An anti-human HVEM nanobody significantly inhibited the invasion of mesenchymal GICs in organotypic cultures and suppressed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, HVEM expression contributed to resistance to anticancer drugs, which was relieved by knockout of HVEM expression in the mesenchymal GICs. Collectively, these findings suggest that beyond its known role in immune evasion through interaction with BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator), activation of HVEM on GBM cells promotes invasion and proliferation of mesenchymal GICs. Thus, HVEM represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of mesenchymal GBM.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Revealing the anti-tumor mechanisms of aromatic oil from Amomum villosum through integrated network pharmacology, bioinformatics, machine learning, single-cell sequencing, and cell experiments.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kai Deng, Yunyao Wei, +3 authors, Qiang Yan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The dry fruits of Amomum villosum (Av) are a traditional Chinese medicine used for gastrointestinal disease. Aromatic oil has been reported to have anti-tumor properties. However, its therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Integrated approaches of response surface design, gas chromatography-mass spectrum-driven network pharmacology analysis, transcriptomics, machine learning, clinic correlation analysis, single-cell sequencing, molecular docking, and dynamics simulation to characterize bioactive compounds in Av and further uncover their potential mechanisms against gastric cancer. The extraction process of aromatic oil was optimized using Box-Behnken design, and the optimal yield of 2.85 % was achieved under the conditions of extraction time of 6.5 h, solution ratio of 16 mL/g, and mesh size of 30. Subsequently, 28 compounds were identified from aromatic oils using the NIST 14 database. Survival curves indicated that the intersection of compound targets and cancer targets was highly correlated with gastric cancer (GC). Machine learning algorithms screened out HMOX1 as the key target from the public dataset and validated the clinic relevance. Single-cell sequencing indicated that HMOX1 might be a crucial immune regulator for myeloid cells. In vitro cell experiments showed that both aromatic oil and its primary compound, bornyl acetate, significantly suppressed HGC27 and AGS cell proliferation and migration, while downregulating HMOX1; bornyl acetate exhibited superior efficacy. Finally, molecular docking and dynamics showed that bornyl acetate had good binding affinity with HMOX1. Aromatic oil and bornyl acetate exert anti-gastric cancer effects via HMOX1, which provides a molecular basis for developing Av-derived therapy in GC therapy.</p>
