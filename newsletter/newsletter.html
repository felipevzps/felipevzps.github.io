<h2 class="paper-title">Comprehensive characterization of AP-1 adaptor complex genes in lung cancer reveals AP1AR as a novel prognostic and therapeutic biomarker.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dahlak Daniel Solomon, I-Jeng Yeh, Hsin-Liang Liu, +10 authors, Meng-Chi Yen</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality. The AP-1 adaptor complex, including AP1AR, AP1S1, AP1S2, AP1S3, AP1M1, AP1M2, AP1B1, and AP1G1, functions as a conserved hub of vesicular trafficking, selecting cargo and coordinating clathrin-mediated transport. By shaping receptor recycling, membrane composition, and signal duration, AP-1 influences core cancer phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, and therapy response. However, the family-level role of AP-1 adaptors in lung cancer is incompletely defined. We systematically profiled all eight AP-1 adaptor genes using multi-omics datasets, survival resources, pharmacogenomic panels, Human Protein Atlas data, pathway enrichment, and single-cell RNA sequencing with cell-cell communication modeling.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Brain Volume Correlations and Machine Learning Classification in Epilepsy Diagnosis.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Costarides V, Kakkos I, +7 authors, Koutsouris DD.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epilepsy is a neurological disorder associated with complex structural and functional changes in the brain. Although volumetric brain measurements can present an indication of ictal characteristics, the complex nature and variability of volumetric differences in the epileptic brain pose challenges for consistent interpretation and generalization. In this regard, his study investigates the relationship between brain region volumes and epilepsy diagnosis, utilizing MRI structural data from individuals with diagnosed epileptic conditions and healthy controls. As such specific brain regions were measured, and correlation analysis was conducted along with statistical Mann-Whitney U testing. These analyses revealed significant differences in brain volumes between healthy participants and those with epilepsy, particularly in regions implicated in seizure generation and propagation. Subsequently, machine learning classifiers were employed to differentiate individuals based on these brain metrics, alongside with demographic and clinical details, with the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers demonstrating the highest classification accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of brain volume metrics as biomarkers for epilepsy and highlight the utility of machine learning models in navigating the complexities of epilepsy diagnosis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Universal paratope-epitope interaction patterns in antibody-antigen structures.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Perez MAS, Zoete V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The binding of antibodies (Abs) to antigens (Ags) is a fundamental mechanism by which the immune system defends the body against harmful invaders. Understanding and predicting this interaction is critical for developing effective therapeutic Abs. In this study, we performed an extensive structural analysis of the largest available non-redundant three-dimensional (3D) database of Ab-Ag complexes. By examining the 3D structures of these complexes, we identified key amino acids (AAs) and their positions within the paratope-epitope interface. We stressed the significance of examining AAs at each complementarity-determining regions (CDR) position, as their interaction frequencies at specific sites can vary greatly from their overall tendency to appear in CDRs. Importantly, we standardized all the paratope-epitope interaction patterns identified, converting them into a format that can be easily utilized by researchers outside the structural biology field, especially those working on antibody development using machine learning. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing Abs, particularly in therapeutic applications, where refining the CDR loops to improve Ag binding is essential for creating effective Abs. This research may also support the development of more precise and reliable Ab-Ag prediction tools.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CD45⁺ hybrid circulating cells may reflect tumor-immune interactions and serve as transcriptomic indicators of metastatic potential in prostate cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kim BG, Jang Y, +12 authors, Joung JY.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circulating hybrid cells expressing both epithelial and immune markers have emerged as indicators of dynamic tumor-immune interactions. This study aimed to characterize circulating hybrid cells co-expressing KRT18 (pan-cytokeratin) and PTPRC (CD45), termed KP_Pos, in metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), and to assess their molecular features, tumor microenvironmental (TME) origins, and clinical relevance. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was used to examine spatial relationships between CK⁺ tumor and CD45⁺ immune cells in metastatic prostate tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from mPCa were analyzed to identify KP_Pos cells and characterize their transcriptional heterogeneity across epithelial and immune lineages. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between KP_Pos and other cells were used to generate predictive gene signatures. Random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models were applied to evaluate metastatic classification performance, and high-performing signatures were validated in bulk RNA-seq datasets and correlated with clinical parameters. IMC revealed frequent spatial proximity between tumor and immune compartments, supporting a TME-derived hybrid phenotype. KP_Pos cells were detected across multiple immune and epithelial clusters, showing heterogeneity and enrichment of immune response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Machine learning-based classifiers using KP_Pos-derived DEGs achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.7) for metastasis, and selected combinations further improved performance in internal validation sets. Signature scores significantly correlated with PSA and Gleason grade, and CD45⁺ hybrid circulating cells were more abundant in patients with advanced disease burden. CD45⁺ KRT18⁺ hybrid circulating cells (KP_Pos) represent biologically distinct populations shaped by tumor-immune interactions within the TME. Their transcriptomic features and derived gene signatures may serve as biomarkers of metastatic potential and indicators of disease progression in prostate cancer. However, their causal role in metastasis and impact on survival remain to be determined.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SenSeqNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Cellular Senescence Detection From Protein Sequences.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jiang H, Deng D, +6 authors, Liu L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular senescence, defined as the irreversible arrest of cell proliferation in response to stress, contributes to tissue dysfunction and drives the progression of age-related diseases. Accurate detection of senescent states is therefore essential for understanding aging mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. However, conventional laboratory assays are time-consuming and difficult to scale. Here, we present SenSeqNet, a deep learning framework that predicts cellular senescence directly from protein sequences. SenSeqNet integrates embeddings from the Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM-2) with a hybrid LSTM-CNN architecture to capture both sequential and higher-order structural features. The model achieved 86.43% accuracy in independent testing, outperforming traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Importantly, the high-confidence genes predicted by SenSeqNet were significantly enriched in canonical senescence-associated pathways, indicating that the model captures biologically coherent regulatory programs rather than overfitting to sequence labels. These results establish SenSeqNet as a robust and biologically informed tool for senescence detection and provide a foundation for accelerating research into aging and age-related therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Development of a decision tree diagram for classifying study designs in tumour pathology research: a multidisciplinary approach.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Craciun OM, García-Ovejero E, +22 authors, WCT EVI MAP Project Team.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours: A Living Evidence Gap Map by Tumour Type (WCT EVI MAP) project aims to develop Evidence Gap Maps of the available evidence, primarily to inform the WHO Classification of Tumours. The project, covering all tumour types, faces the challenge of reviewing a huge number of studies by reviewers from multiple backgrounds. The aim was to develop a decision tree (DT) diagram for classifying study designs reporting on tumour pathology studies, in order to support the decision-making process when assigning evidence levels across various disciplines. A modified consensus process, incorporating stakeholder workshops, was conducted in three phases: (1) development of the initial DT diagram draft (literature review and expert evaluation); (2) iterative reviews with project partners; and (3) testing the advanced DT diagram version with several sets of references to refine critical points. A total of 368 records were used for training throughout the entire process. Consensus was achieved when classifications could categorise studies consistently without causing discordance in new example sets. A DT diagram and its Glossary of Operational Definitions with 27 decision nodes and 26 categories were developed. The DT diagram is organised into six sections: WCT EVI MAP selection criteria, evidence synthesis, basic research related studies, descriptive studies, observational and experimental studies, and diagnostic test studies. The DT diagram is a valuable tool for the project's needs, successfully integrating diverse disciplinary perspectives for classifying evidence in tumour pathology research according to study design. It lays the foundation for future advancements in evidence mapping and classification within tumour pathology and related disciplines.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Translating Geroscience Into Clinical Longevity Dermatology: From Mechanisms of Aging to Skin-Centered Interventions.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Haykal D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Longevity medicine is an emerging clinical framework aimed at extending healthspan by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging rather than treating disease in isolation. Geroscience, which investigates the molecular and cellular pathways linking aging to chronic pathology, provides the scientific foundation for this approach. Dermatology is uniquely positioned within this paradigm, as the skin represents both a visible marker of biological aging and an accessible source of biomarkers.To explore how principles of geroscience can be translated into clinical dermatology and cosmetic practice, with a focus on skin-centered biomarkers, artificial intelligence (AI), and preventive longevity-oriented interventions.This piece integrates current evidence from geroscience, dermatologic aging research, microbiome science, and AI-driven analytics to examine emerging models of longevity-focused dermatologic care. Conceptual frameworks, clinical readiness of interventions, and ethical considerations are critically discussed.Advances in biological aging biomarkers, including epigenetic clocks, inflammatory signatures, mitochondrial and metabolic markers, and skin microbiome profiling, offer promising tools for assessing cutaneous and systemic aging. AI-enabled platforms facilitate the integration of multidimensional data, enabling refined biological age assessment and potential prediction of treatment responses. However, most longevity-oriented diagnostics and interventions remain in early or experimental stages, requiring rigorous validation before routine clinical adoption.Dermatology can serve as a translational bridge between geroscience and clinical longevity medicine by integrating validated skin biomarkers, aesthetic procedures, and preventive strategies within an evidence-based framework. Careful attention to scientific limitations, ethical considerations, and health equity is essential to ensure responsible implementation. Dermatologists would play a key role in shaping clinically sound, prevention-focused longevity care centered on long-term skin health and resilience.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Chromatin Profiling Reveals Distinct Male and Female Trajectories for Developmental Learning Potential.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kunzelman GW, Batistuzzo A, London SE.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adult patterns of behavior can often be explained by developmental experiences. In some cases, developmental experience can have permanent influence on brain and behavior only during specific ages; these phases are called critical or sensitive periods. Epigenetic mechanisms can regulate both maturational and experiential processes in the brain by coordinating transcription of genes involved in organization and plasticity. Epigenetics thus may have particular relevance to critical periods. As such, we employed ChIP-seq to assess accessible regulatory regions, segments of the genome where transcription factors (TFs) bind, using the epigenetic marker H3K27ac. We focused on the auditory forebrain, required for developmental sensory song learning, in juvenile male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Both sexes rely on developmental sensory learning to bias adult behaviors, though males have a defined critical period for this process, whereas it is not clear that females do. Thus, we sought to address two major questions: (1) Are H327ac peaks changing in males as they transition into their critical period, and if so, how?, and (2) How similar are the female H3K27ac peaks at the same ages of development? Our analyses revealed that age and sex affect H3K27ac-based peak profiles and enriched TF binding sites within them, as well as genes annotated to those H3K27ac-defined peaks. These findings provide new insights into how epigenetic regulation may influence auditory forebrain organization and function in the context of changing learning potential across a sensitive developmental period and create a foundation for additional studies.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Wilson CS, Falk A, +13 authors, Moore DJ.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a rare, monogenic autoimmune disorder that may manifest as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, delays progression of stage 2 T1D, but its effects in APS-1-associated diabetes are unknown.We report clinical responses of two adolescents with APS-1 and stage 2 T1D who received 14-day courses of teplizumab. In one patient, pancreatic MRI and spectral immune cell phenotyping were performed before and after treatment.Both patients exhibited improved glycemia. One who briefly required insulin recovered insulin independence 2 weeks after therapy. Pancreatic volume transiently increased, and circulating lymphocytes showed changes in homing receptors and senescence markers in the individual who underwent those studies. Nonpancreatic APS-1 manifestations were unchanged.Teplizumab may preserve β-cell function in APS-1-associated T1D. Larger studies are needed to define efficacy, durability, and immunologic and tissue mechanisms in this rare context.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Naqvi, S. M. A., Khan, F., Muslim, S. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dengue (DENV), an RNA virus, remains a significant global health threat, particularly in developing regions, with no widely effective antiviral therapy available. The CRISPR-Cas13b system, specifically the PspCas13b subtype, has emerged as a promising programmable antiviral tool capable of targeting viral RNA with high specificity. However, the efficacy of Cas13b-based interventions relies heavily on the design of potent and conserved CRISPR RNA (crRNA) spacer sequences, a task complicated by high viral genetic diversity. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, which targets double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic genomes, Cas13b directly targets single-stranded RNA, making it ideally suited for RNA virus therapeutics; however, existing computational tools predominantly focus on Cas9 DNA targeting or Cas13d for mammalian transcript knockdown, leaving a significant gap for Cas13b-specific viral antiviral design. In this paper, we propose a computational pipeline and machine learning framework for the rational design of high-efficacy Cas13b guide RNAs targeting all four Dengue serotypes. Our approach integrates large-scale genomic data extraction, conservation analysis, and a novel in silico optimization module for guide RNA (gRNA) sequences, based on recently reported Cas13b design rules (e.g., 5' GG motif preference, Cytosine penalties). To predict targeting efficiency, we benchmark classical machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) against foundation model-based predictors (Nucleotide Transformer, RNA-FM) using a dataset of experimentally validated spacers. Our results demonstrate that classical feature-engineered models significantly outperform deep learning approaches when trained on experimentally validated gRNA datasets in low-data regimes. We identify highly conserved, optimized crRNA candidates, including several pan-serotype guides with predicted high potency. This work establishes a baseline for Cas13b efficiency prediction and provides a robust computational resource for accelerating the development of CRISPR-based antivirals against Dengue and other RNA viruses.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Generative AI-based design of hybrid transcriptional activator proteins with new DNA-binding specificity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Okuda, S., Minami, A., +4 authors, Kiga, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcriptional control arises from the specific recognition of promoter DNA by transcription factors (TFs), forming the basis of cellular information processing and gene regulation. In synthetic biology, TF-promoter interactions are assembled into gene circuits to program cellular behaviors. To ensure reliable circuit performance, most synthetic gene circuits rely on well-characterized and orthogonal regulatory parts. This reliance minimizes crosstalk but constrains circuit complexity and information integration. Creating hybrid TFs that combine or interpolate promoter specificities could therefore expand the design space of synthetic regulatory systems. However, it remains unclear whether hybrid functions can be created by mixing amino acid sequences, and how such functional integration could be achieved in a principled manner. Here we show that a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on LuxR-family DNA-binding domains can generate transcription factors with hybrid and partially novel promoter recognition properties. By sampling intermediate regions of the VAE-learned latent space, we designed hybrid TFs that activate both the lux and las promoters. High-throughput sort-seq assays together with individual in vivo assays revealed that a subset of functional variants exhibited dual-responsive behavior while maintaining sequence-selective DNA recognition. Together, these results provide a data-driven strategy for exploring functional intermediate sequences between closely related proteins.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Y.-T., Triche, T. J., DeBruine, Z. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large single-cell atlases now span tens of millions of cells, yet few provide reusable and interpretable reference representations that support direct biological reasoning at atlas-scale. Here, we present an interpretable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization reference embedding of 28.5 million healthy cells and approximately 60,000 genes from the Human Cell Census. The resulting gene and cell weights define additive transcriptional programs that align with annotated cell types and organized biological pathways. New datasets can be projected into this fixed reference space without fine-tuning or retraining, as we demonstrate using an independent cystic fibrosis dataset. This resource provides a transparent coordinate system for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation, complementing deep embeddings that prioritize integration or prediction with a representation designed for interpretability and reuse.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Phylogenetic tree-aware positive-unlabeled deep metric learning for phage-host interaction identification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Y.-z., Tobias, B., Imoto, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and play essential roles in shaping microbial communities. Identifying phage-host interactions (PHIs) is crucial for understanding infection dynamics and developing phage-based therapeutic strategies. Recent deep learning approaches have shown great promise for PHI prediction; however, their performance remains constrained by the limited number of experimentally validated positive pairs and the overwhelming abundance of unlabeled or non-validated samples. Moreover, most existing models overlook higher-level phylogenetic relationships among hosts, which could provide valuable structural priors for guiding representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a phylogenetic tree-aware positive-unlabeled deep metric learning framework for phage-host interaction (PHI) identification. Unlike traditional approaches that train classification models to strictly separate positive and negative phage-host pairs, the proposed method learns representations under supervision from both confirmed positive PHIs and host phylogenetic tree constraints on non-positive samples. The proposed method can seamlessly formalize contrastive learning and deep metric learning within the same framework that explicitly optimizes PHI encoders with biological constraints in the learning functions. We show that this metric learning formulation outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that enforce separation between positive and negative samples without consistently aligning the learned representations with evolutionary distances. Experiments on the Cherry benchmark dataset and metagenome Hi-C multi-host dataset demonstrate that our approach enhances species-level prediction accuracy, improves cross-host generalization, and yields more interpretable representations of phage-host relationships.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Metabolite Fraction Libraries for Quantitative NMR Metabolomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Esselman, C., Garrison, K., +3 authors, Edison, A. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has unique strengths in metabolomics studies, particularly in quantifying mixtures and elucidating the structures of unknown molecules. One-dimensional (1D) proton (1H) NMR is the most common method; however, spectral overlap is significant, making analysis challenging. We present a new approach that utilizes chromatographically separated fractions from a pooled sample, henceforth called a metabolite fraction library (mFL). We developed an algorithm to extract highly correlated peaks from the mFL, collectively forming a metabolite basis set (mBS). The mBS can be fit to NMR profiling data, enabling comprehensive quantification. Applied to 10 mixtures of 53 metabolites, our approach accurately quantified 50, quantified an impurity and an oxidation product, and described between 91-96% of total spectral intensity. The method is demonstrated using the fungus Neurospora crassa, resulting in the identification of 45 metabolites with high confidence, 45 with medium confidence, and accounting for 94% of total spectral intensity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hippocampome.org, a resource for subicular neuron types and beyond</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tecuatl, C., Ascoli, G. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To establish the relationship between circuit organization and information processing, many neuroscientists find it useful to reason in terms of neuron types. Hippocampome.org uses axonal and dendritic morphology as a foundational approach to classify neurons in the rodent hippocampal formation, including dentate gyrus, Cornu Ammonis, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. For each identified neuron type, this open access knowledge base annotates essential properties, such as main neurotransmitter, membrane biophysics, firing patterns, molecular expression, and cell counts. Moreover, Hippocampome.org quantifies circuitry in terms of directional connection probabilities and synaptic signals between interacting neuron types. All properties are directly linked to peer reviewed experimental evidence and best-fitted with computational models. The resultant online resource provides an effective reference to design new experiments, analyses, and spiking neural network simulations. Here we illustrate the content and utility of Hippocampome.org with a focus on the subiculum, whose neuron type organization has received relatively less attention. Only 6 of the 180 Hippocampome.org neuron types are from the subiculum, compared to more than 60 in the adjacent area CA1. Specifically, we analyze the local subicular circuit and its broader interaction with the hippocampal formation with respect to both anatomical connectivity and signal transfer. Our results exemplify the potential added value of data integration in neuronal classification, while also highlighting the need for further research to fill existing knowledge gaps.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Sokolova, K., Kosenkov, D., +4 authors, Troyanskaya, O. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The growing availability of biological data resources has transformed research, yet their effective use remains challenging: selecting appropriate sources requires domain knowledge, data are fragmented across databases, and synthesizing results into reliable conclusions is labor-intensive. Although large language models promise to address these barriers, their impact in biomedicine has been limited by unsupported statements, incorrect claims, and lack of provenance. We introduce Alvessa, an evidence-grounded agentic research assistant designed around verifiability. Alvessa integrates entity recognition, orchestration of pre-validated biological tools, and data-constrained answer generation with statement-level verification against retrieved records, explicitly flagging unsupported claims and guiding revision when reliability criteria are not met. We evaluate Alvessa on dbQA from LAB-Bench and GenomeArena, a benchmark of 720 questions spanning gene and variant annotation, pathways, molecular interactions, miRNA targets, drug-target evidence, protein structure, and gene-phenotype associations. Alvessa substantially improves accuracy relative to general-purpose language models and performs comparably to coding-centric agents while producing fully traceable outputs. Using adversarial perturbations, we show that detection of fabricated statements depends critically on access to retrieved evidence. We further demonstrate application to drug discovery, where evidence-grounded synthesis enables identification of candidate targets missed or misattributed by literature-centered reasoning alone. Alvessa and GenomeArena are released to the community to support reproducible, verifiable AI-assisted biological research.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Yu, B., Liu, D., +4 authors, Sun, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large-scale single-cell CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) readouts provide critical data to map causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, translating the complex scRNA-seq outputs into reliable causal insights remains a major analytical challenge. Here we present CausalGRN, a scalable computational framework that infers causal GRNs and predicts cellular responses to unseen perturbations. CausalGRN first mitigates pervasive spurious partial correlations in sparse scRNA-seq data through a novel adaptive thresholding correction, enabling robust inference of an undirected graph. It then orients this graph using observed perturbation outcomes. The resulting directed GRN can be used to predict the downstream effects of novel perturbations via network propagation. Across both simulations and diverse experimental datasets, CausalGRN substantially outperforms existing approaches in network reconstruction accuracy and in predicting the effects of unseen perturbations, providing a principled bridge from perturbation data to causal gene regulation.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Sant'Anna-Silva, A. C. B., Abbe, P., +13 authors, Rocchi, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and despite major advances in targeted and immune therapies, durable responses remain limited due to the emergence of resistance mechanisms. Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key driver of therapy resistance, allowing tumor cells to adapt to environmental and therapeutic pressures. Here, we identify the maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) as a critical mediator of resistance in melanoma. We demonstrate that MELK stimulates intracellular accumulation of amino acids, leading to activation of mTORC1 signaling and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. This metabolic shift promotes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Importantly, preclinical MELK inhibition sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to immunotherapy, revealing a potential combinatorial strategy to overcome resistance. Our findings establish MELK as a central regulator of metabolic adaptation and therapeutic resistance in melanoma, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Systematic Review of Evidence for the Cost of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kane, B. S., Mestas, L., +4 authors, Maley, C. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Emergence of therapeutic resistance is a critical clinical challenge in cancer treatment, contributing to treatment failure, disease relapse, and overall poor prognosis. Adaptive therapy (AT), a resistance management strategy, aims to address this issue by selectively applying therapeutic pressure to promote competition between therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant clones, allowing for long-term control of tumor burden. AT relies upon the assumption that resistance comes at some fitness cost in the absence of therapy. Is that assumption justified? We conducted a systematic review of the literature on experimental tests of the fitness cost of therapeutic resistance. We conducted a search for peer-reviewed papers that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) experiments of direct competition, (ii) between therapy-resistant and therapy-sensitive clones, (iii) in a therapy-free environment. We found 47 experiments that matched those criteria. Of those experiments, approximately two-thirds (68%) found a fitness cost to resistance in a competitive environment. Of all pooled features from the studies reviewed, we found that the resistance characteristic was most significantly associated with whether resistant clones exhibited a fitness advantage in competition (p=0.0147). Further, we identify complex ecological interactions that may influence the behavior of the cancer cell population without selection by therapeutic pressure. Predicting which resistance characteristics can be exploited therapeutically with AT and identifying potential methods of modulating the costliness of the resistant phenotype may be critical to future improvements in cancer therapy.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Han, T., Sun, Z., +26 authors, Sawyers, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an increasingly frequent mechanism of resistance to androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) therapy in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). This lineage transition is dependent on upregulation of the NE-specifying transcription factor ASCL1, typically in a genetic background of RB1 and TP53 loss. Here we identify extracellular matrix-integrin-YAP1/TEAD signaling as a critical brake on NEPC lineage transition. Deletion of Itgb1, the shared B1 subunit required for collagen and laminin-mediated integrin activation, is sufficient to induce ASCL1 and NE lineage gene expression, by activating LATS1/2 kinases with subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TEAD signaling. Conversely, restoration of YAP1/TEAD signaling by pharmacological LATS1/2 inhibition, or by expression of constitutively active YAP1/TAZ mutants, prevents or reverts NEPC lineage transition. NOTCH and AR cooperate with YAP/TEAD to repress ASCL1, such that combined inhibition leads to complete reprograming of PRAD into NEPC in vitro, providing a dynamic platform to dissect the molecular events responsible for lineage transition over time. We find that lineage transition is accompanied by a redistribution of FOXA1 and TEAD cistromes from PRAD to NEPC-specific enhancers and requires the pioneering activity of FOXA1. Thus, extracellular matrix/integrin signaling in the PRAD tumor microenvironment restrains NE lineage plasticity, highlighting a potential path for pharmacological inhibitors in modulating treatment-induced lineage change.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omics characterization of IDH-mutant astrocytoma-derived cell lines reveals NOTCH-regulated plastic quiescent astrocyte-like state</h2>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Diffuse IDH-mutant astrocytomas are brain tumors typically diagnosed as low-grade but capable of progressing to higher grades. They exhibit three cellular states resembling astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neural progenitor (NPC) cells. Understanding their biology has been challenging due to the lack of relevant in vitro models. Here we established and extensively characterized four astrocytoma cell lines (LGG275, LGG336, LGG85, LGG349) derived from IDH-mutant astrocytoma at different grades, cultured in defined media and analyzed by multi-omics. These lines display growth rates in vitro and in vivo consistent with tumor grade and recapitulate key molecular alterations observed in patient tumors, including IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 mutations, activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway and, in the most aggressive line, amplification of MET and PDGFRA. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the 4 astrocytoma lines maintain the three major cellular states observed in patient tumors. A hallmark of higher-grade-derived lines (LGG85, LGG349) is the persistence of NPC-like populations without growth factors, reflecting tumor progression. The LGG275 line most accurately mirrors slow-growing astrocytomas. Using CD44 and GLAST, we isolated astrocyte-like cells (CD44/GLAST) from LGG275 that preferentially adopt a quiescent state yet retain remarkable plasticity, generating oligodendrocyte-like cells (CD44-/GLAST-). Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that astrocyte-like and oligodendrocyte-like cells populations resemble quiescent and activated neural stem (NSC) cells from the adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Finally, we found that NOTCH signaling regulates the balance between astrocytic and oligodendrocytic states, while DLL3, expressed by oligodendrocyte-like cells, modulates both proliferation and phenotype. These cell lines represent valuable resources for dissecting lineage dynamics, heterogeneity, and progression mechanisms in IDH-mutant astrocytomas.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep learning for deep learning performance: How much data is needed for segmentation in biomedical imaging?</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Junhyeok Lee, Hyungjin Chung, +2 authors, Kyu Sung Choi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning (DL) models are widely adopted in biomedical imaging, where image segmentation is increasingly recognized as a quantitative tool for extracting clinically meaningful information. However, model performance critically depends on dataset size and training configuration, including model capacity. Traditional sample size estimation methods are inadequate for DL due to its reliance on high-dimensional data and its nonlinear learning behavior. To address this gap, we propose a DL-specific framework to estimate the minimal dataset size required for stable segmentation performance. We validate this framework across two distinct clinical tasks: colorectal polyp segmentation from 2D endoscopic images (Kvasir-SEG) and glioma segmentation from 3D brain MRIs (BraTS 2020). We trained residual U-Nets-a simple, yet foundational architecture-across 200 configurations for Kvasir-SEG and 40 configurations for BraTS 2020, varying data subsets (2%-100% for the 2D task and 5%-100% for the 3D task). In both tasks, performance metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) consistently improved with increasing data and depth, but gains invariably plateaued beyond approximately 80% data usage. The best configuration for polyp segmentation (6 layers, 100% data) achieved a DSC of 0.86, while the best for brain tumor segmentation reached a DSC of 0.79. Critically, we introduce a surrogate modeling pipeline using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict these performance curves. A simple uni-directional LSTM model accurately forecasted the final DSC, accurately forecasting the final DSC with low mean absolute error across both tasks. These findings demonstrate that segmentation performance can be reliably estimated with lightweight models, suggesting that collecting a moderate amount of high-quality data is often sufficient for developing clinically viable DL models. Our framework provides a practical, empirical method for optimizing resource allocation in medical AI development.</p>
