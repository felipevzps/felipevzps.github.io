<h2 class="paper-title">NetMHCIIphosPan: a machine learning tool for predictingHLA class II antigen presentation of phosphorylated peptides.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Alvarez, H. M. G., Kaabinejadian, S., +7 authors, Nielsen, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phosphorylated peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules play pivotal roles in immune regulation, yet their characterization and prediction remain challenging due to data noise and limited HLA coverage. Here, we introduce NetMHCIIphosPan, a prediction method for HLA-II antigen presentation of phosphorylated peptides, developed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics datasets. Employing a refined peptide identification workflow, we reanalyzed earlier HLA-II phospholigand datasets and trained predictive models, achieving superior performance compared to models trained on original data. Binding motif analysis revealed that HLA-specific preferences for phospholigands closely aligned with those of unmodified ligands. Incorporating unmodified ligands into training further enhanced predictive accuracy, particularly for HLA-DP and HLA-DQ molecules. NetMHCIIphosPan outperformed existing tools, such as NetMHCIIpan-4.3 and MixMHC2pred-1.3, for prediction of HLA antigen presentation of phosphorylated peptides demonstrating robustness and utility. This work establishes NetMHCIIphosPan as a state-of-the-art tool for understanding the HLA-II phospholigandome, with potential applications in immunotherapy and vaccine design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting TCR-pMHC Binding by Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lang, J., Yu, C., +7 authors, Li, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The binding between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is fundamental to the immune system ability to recognize and eliminate pathogens. Accurate prediction of TCR-pMHC interactions holds significant promise for advancing cancer immunotherapy, vaccine design, and autoimmune disease research. However, existing approaches often treat the sequences, structures, and functions of TCRs, peptides, and MHC molecules in isolation, neglecting their interdependencies and hence limiting the prediction accuracy. In this study, we present ProTCR, a novel approach that integrates sequence, structural, and functional information within a reinforcement learning framework, offering a new paradigm for predicting TCR-pMHC binding. The reinforcement learning optimization enables ProTCR to generate TCR-pMHC sequences with enhanced binding propensity, thereby improving prediction accuracy. On benchmark datasets such as IEDB and VDJdb, ProTCR achieves an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 32.7%, while offering interpretable insights into the structural and sequence determinants of binding. We further validate ProTCR using TCRs and neoantigens derived from a cervical cancer patient via proteogenomic profiling. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between T cell clonal expansion and ProTCR-predicted TCR-peptide binding scores, supporting the biological relevance of the model. Additionally, ProTCR demonstrates robust performance in predicting SARS-CoV-2 TCR-pMHC complexes and generating MHC-specific peptides with potential applications in peptide-based immunotherapies. Collectively, these findings establish ProTCR as a powerful and interpretable tool for TCR-pMHC binding prediction, with broad utility across immunology research and translational applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Atlas-Based Spatio-temporal MRI Phenotyping of 3D Fungal Spread in Grapevine Wood</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Phukon, G., Cardoso, M., +4 authors, Fernandez, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In perennial crops, inner wood degradation often escapes detection until irreversible damage has occurred. Grapevine trunk disease (GTD) is a well-known example in viticulture that alters plants from within, years before foliar symptoms arise, making early assessment difficult. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel non-destructive 3D + t pipeline for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial quantification and monitoring of early internal tissue degradation resulting from fungal colonization. This pipeline integrates (i) anatomical alignment and rigid time-series registration of volumetric MRI scans, (ii) a generalized cylindrical coordinate transformation for cross-sectional trunk anatomy normalization, (iii) supervised classification to segment water-depleted (diseased/non-functional) regions, and (iv) population-level statistical analyses including construction of population mean images, probabilistic atlases of lesions, and 3D lesion descriptors. Applied to multiple Vitis vinifera cultivars inoculated with a fungal trunk pathogen, our approach enables time-lapse comparisons of cultivar and treatment in vivo. The results reveal consistent early degradation signals across individuals and cultivar-dependent lesion differences. By combining high-resolution MRI with advanced image processing and statistical atlas tools, this method provides a new paradigm for 3D plant phenotyping of internal disease progression. This methodological innovation allows non-invasive quantification of disease development and comparative assessment of host responses in woody plants, demonstrating its potential to advance understanding and management of GTDs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Large-scale Visuomotor Reaction Time Self-Testing Reveals Subtle Motor Changes in Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Impairment</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, X., Bindoff, A., +9 authors, Alty, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introduction: Affordable tools for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection could support drug development and early intervention. Subtle motor changes may indicate preclinical AD, but hand response selection and initiation speeds are understudied. This study assessed whether unsupervised, online visuomotor reaction time (RT) tests relate to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a validated high risk state for future conversion to AD Methods: A total of 910 participants (age 66.3 +/- 7.5, 70.8% female) completed assessments of simple and choice visuomotor RT tests at home as part of the online TAS Test protocol; they also completed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) episodic memory and executive function tests. Among them, 142 participants reported SCI. Results: On the TAS Test visuomotor tests, SCI was associated with 8.4% [1.4%, 15.4%] longer RT ( (p = .008; adjusted for task complexity), greater odds of time-out failure (OR = 1.35 [1.01, 1.81]; p = .037), and greater variance in RT (log-variance (SCI - comparison) = .094 [.028, .159]; p &lt; .001). There were no significant differences between the SCI and comparison groups on any of the CANTAB tests. After adjusting for SCI status, none of the CANTAB tests were significantly associated with RT. Discussion: SCI was associated with longer and more variable visuomotor RT, and greater odds of time-out failure, while not being associated with tests of memory and executive function. Cognitive test scores did not explain a significant amount of variance in visuomotor RT. Taken together, these results support a hypothesis that people with SCI may be experiencing earlier visuomotor deficits that are distinct from (or precede) decline in episodic memory and executive function. Visuomotor tasks that record RT may be more sensitive to preclinical manifestations of cognitive decline than more traditional tests of cognitive function.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BiomeGPT: A foundation model for the human gut microbiome</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Medearis, N. A., Zhu, S., Zomorrodi, A. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human gut microbiome encodes rich information about host health, yet current analysis pipelines remain narrowly optimized for individual tasks. This limits our ability to gain a thorough view of how the microbiome impacts health and disease. Here we introduce BiomeGPT, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on over 13,300 human gut metagenomes spanning 32 phenotypes, including healthy and 31 diverse diseases, to learn context-aware, species-level gut microbiome representations. The model captures quantitative compositional structure and intricate cross-species dependencies embedded within community profiles. When fine-tuned for predicting host health status, BiomeGPT accurately distinguishes healthy from diseased microbiomes and resolves individual disease states across a broad clinical spectrum. Furthermore, its attention patterns reveal biologically plausible microbial signatures, highlighting both shared and disease-specific microbial species linked to host phenotypes. By providing a unified, scalable framework for species-level gut microbiome representation learning and prediction, BiomeGPT enables new avenues for biomarker discovery, disease stratification, and microbiome-driven precision medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PRADA-DTI: A Prototype-Retrieval Augmented Domain-Adaptation Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhu, J., Lv, T., Pan, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drug target interaction (DTl) prediction is a fundamental task in computational drug discovery. However, most existing DTI models assume a static learning environment, whereas real-world biomedical data are dynamic, characterized by the continuous emergence of new protein families and interaction patterns. This poses major challenges for model generalization and continual adaptation, especially under privacy and data-access constraints. To address these issues, we introduce PRADA-DTI, a retrieval-augmented, parameter-efficient framework for domain-incremental DTI learning. Built on a shared physicochemical backbone, PRADADTI learns domain-specialized prompts for representation-level modulation, coupled with LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for parameter-space adaptation. At inference, protein embeddings query a compact prototype memory without storing raw molecular data, retrieving similar domains to dynamically compose the relevant prompts and LoRA parameters without requiring domain labels. This retrieval-guided composition enables continual learning from new protein domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting on previous ones. On BindingDB and BIOSNAP benchmarks, PRADA-DTI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning and parameter-efficient baselines in both predictive accuracy and forgetting mitigation with minimal parameter updates. Interpretability analysis through residue-level attribution visualization demonstrates that the model correctly attends to binding pocket regions across different protein domains, confirming that the retrieval-guided adaptation mechanism captures biologically relevant structural patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval augmented parameter adaptation for continual drug discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The combination of BCL-xL PROTAC and mTOR inhibitor sensitizes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to KRASG12D inhibitor treatment by enhancing apoptosis induction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Miyan, J., Vudatha, V., +6 authors, KHAN, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with a five-year survival rate of approximately 13%, partly because of limited treatment options and resistance to therapies. Although the recently discovered KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133 has shown promise for PDAC treatment in preclinical studies, its clinical efficacy as a single agent is expected to be limited, as is the case with KRAS G12C inhibitors. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated potential combination strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect of MRTX1133. We rationally combined MRTX1133 with the BCL-xL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) DT2216 and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which significantly potentiated the anti-tumor activity of MRTX1133 in multiple G12D-mutated PDAC cells in vitro by enhancing apoptosis induction. Mechanistically, MRTX1133 treatment increased BIM and decreased NOXA levels, while the combination of DT2216/everolimus was shown to simultaneously enhance BIM release and stabilize NOXA. In vivo, DT2216/everolimus combination significantly potentiated the anti-tumor activity of MRTX1133 in AsPC1 PDAC xenograft model. Furthermore, the triple combination of MRTX1133, DT2216, and everolimus effectively overcame acquired resistance to MRTX1133 in AsPC1 cells in vitro and in xenograft model. Collectively, our findings suggest that the single-agent efficacy of MRTX1133 is limited by apoptosis inhibition, and that its combination with DT2216/everolimus can enhance apoptosis and potentially overcome resistance in KRAS G12D-mutated PDAC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A modular patient-derived organoid-xenograft platform reveals molecular and clinical trajectories of prostate cancer progression</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Parmentier, R., Dolgos, R., +15 authors, Le Magnen, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are becoming increasingly important in prostate cancer (PCa) translational research. However, direct proof-of-concept studies demonstrating their ability to model disease evolution, identify relevant biomarkers, and accurately predict treatment response in PCa patients, remain scarce. Here, we report the establishment of serially transplantable xenografts series derived from two advanced PCa PDO lines, which can be further re-cultured as organoids. Newly-generated model series maintain key phenotypic, genomic, and functional characteristics of the original patient tumors, and emulate relevant molecular subtypes of advanced PCa. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis uncovers transcriptomic differences between xenograft and organoid models, as well as signaling pathways which are largely preserved and can be targeted ex vivo. Functional drug profiles correlate with molecular and clinical attributes, as exemplified by response to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors and glucocorticoid-mediated AR signaling activation. Longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of perturbed PDOs identifies a rare PROX1+/ALDH1A1+ cell population, which pre-exist in the treatment-naive setting and is significantly enriched upon androgen deprivation. Notably, this cell population is similarly enriched in post-treatment samples of the original patient and is associated with aggressive AR-negative PCa molecular subtypes, suggesting a potential link with PCa progression. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that organoids can mirror PCa patient-specific drug sensitivity profiles and molecular paths of disease progression, uncovering pertinent biomarkers. Ultimately, our organoid-xenograft model series provide a modular and scalable platform that can readily be used for mechanistic and translational studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The Extracellular Matrix Regulates Invasion in Fusion-Negative Rhabdomyosarcoma via YAP-PIEZO1 Signaling Axis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pan, Y., Kim, J., +2 authors, Park, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma (FNRMS) is the prevalent subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma. Its invasion often leads to recurrence and poor prognosis. This study investigates how the density of the extracellular matrix (ECM), surrounding cancer cells in the tissue, influences FNRMS invasion. We found that high ECM density activates the protein YAP, which directly triggers the expression of the mechanical sensor PIEZO1. This sensor allows calcium to enter the cells, providing a signal that facilitates invasion. Pharmacological inhibition of this axis successfully reduced the invasive potential, highlighting a novel therapeutic vulnerability for FNRMS patients.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is always driven by fusions involving one of the three retinoic acid receptors, why PML and RARA are the preferred fusion partners has remained largely unsettled. Here we demonstrate that corepressor (NCoR) binding onto the RARA moiety of PML/RARA is required for hematopoietic progenitor immortalization. We then establish that PML-mediated tethering of the UBC9 SUMO conjugating enzyme onto PML/RARA enforces SUMO2 conjugation of multiple RARA partner proteins, notably the NCoR complex, boosting its repressive power. PML mutants that fail to recruit UBC9 yield PML/RARA fusions that neither promote NCoR sumoylation nor transformation. Conversely, direct UBC9/RARA fusion drives both efficient NCoR sumoylation and immortalization. Sumoylation inhibitors re-activate retinoic acid target genes in PML/RARA-, but not RARA-, expressing progenitors and trigger APL differentiation. Thus, fusion of PML to RARA entails an unexpected key gain of function that boosts RARA-mediated transcriptional repression through sumoylation of PML/RARA-bound protein, explaining the recurrent implication of PML and RARA in APL pathogenesis.</p>
