<h2 class="paper-title">Intrinsic DNA codes govern distinct modes of nucleosome-transcription factor interactions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Carson, C. W., Umesh Nagalakshmi, S., +4 authors, Cui, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The interplay between transcription factors (TFs) and nucleosomes is central to gene regulation, yet most studies adopt a protein-centric perspective that largely overlooks DNA sequence contributions. Here, we identify four distinct nucleosomal DNA classes, including the canonical WW/SS pattern (W = A/T, S = G/C). All four nucleosome types are widespread across the human genome both in vivo and in vitro. Nucleosomes sharing the same pattern are rotationally in phase, whereas different patterns exhibit specific rotational offsets, revealing distinct DNA-encoded codes for nucleosome positioning. Analysis of 747 TFs across eukaryotes shows that the WW/SS and anti-WW/SS patterns are strongly associated with TF binding in chromatin. Differences in the proportions of these two patterns, quantified as {Delta}NPS values, correlate closely with in vitro nucleosome occupancy. Integrating {Delta}NPS with in vivo nucleosome occupancy uncovers four distinct modes of nucleosome-TF interaction and provides new insight into nucleosome-depleted regions around TF binding sites.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rapid and Consistent Genome Clustering for Navigating Bacterial Diversity with Millions of MAGs and Isolates</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">von Wachsmann, J. H., Lorenz, L. J., +5 authors, Finn, R. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bacterial genome databases now exceed 7 million assemblies; however, the massive redundancy and limited scalability of existing tools create bottlenecks for large-scale analyses. Current clustering methods struggle beyond a few thousand genomes, making database-wide organisation computationally infeasible. Here, we present gemsparcl, a tool that clusters bacterial genomes at species-level resolution over 400x faster than existing methods. We developed sketchlib.rust, implementing one-permutation MinHash with densification in binned sketches to accelerate all-versus-all comparisons. Combined with distance correction of incomplete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for accurate distance estimation and network-based quality filtering to edges, gemsparcl clusters genomes into biologically coherent species-level groups. We clustered 2.2 million bacterial genomes (1.86 million isolates and 360,000 MAGs) into 15,837 species-level genomic cohesive units (GCUs) in 12 hours using 32 cores and less than 64GB of memory. The method achieves 99.8{per thousand} species purity on high-quality isolates while maintaining accuracy across mixed-quality datasets. This advance enables routine database maintenance for resources like MGnify, as well as reference-free microbiome analysis across millions of genomes, and database-wide metagenomics studies that were previously impossible due to computational constraints. Gemsparcl transforms bacterial genome organisation from a months-long challenge requiring high-performance computing into an overnight analysis on standard hardware.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SNAP: Streamlined Nextflow Analysis Pipeline for Immunoprecipitation-Based Epigenomic Profiling of Circulating Chromatin</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Z., Da Silva Cordeiro, P., +23 authors, Baca, S. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epigenomic profiling of circulating chromatin is a powerful and minimally invasive approach for detecting and monitoring disease, but there are no bioinformatics pipelines tailored to the unique characteristics of cell-free chromatin. We present SNAP (Streamlined Nextflow Analysis Pipeline), a reproducible, scalable, and modular workflow specifically designed for immunoprecipitation-based methods for profiling cell-free chromatin. SNAP incorporates quality control metrics optimized for circulating chromatin, including enrichment score and fragment count thresholds, as well as direct estimation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) content from fragment length distributions. It also includes SNP fingerprinting to enable sample identity verification. When applied to cfChIP-seq and cfMeDIP-seq data across multiple cancer types, SNAP's quality filters significantly improved classification performance while maintaining high data retention. Independent validation using plasma from patients with osteosarcoma confirmed the detection of tumor-associated epigenomic signatures that correlated with ctDNA levels and reflected disease biology. SNAP's modular architecture enables straightforward extension to additional cell-free immunoprecipitation-based assays, providing a robust framework to support studies of circulating chromatin broadly. SNAP is compatible with cloud and high-performance computing environments and is publicly available at https://github.com/prc992/SNAP/.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-task spatial omics analytics for high-precision modeling of tissue architecture with STAX</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Guo, Z.-H., Huang, D.-S., Zhang, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid advancement of spatial omics technology has revolutionized biomedical research, unveiling unprecedented insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of biological systems. Despite this progress, a critical limitation arises from the widespread use of disparate analytical tools within a single workflow, leading to inconsistencies caused by heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines and extensive method-specific hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we aim to unify diverse analytical tasks within a multi-task learning platform, STAX, for diverse spatial omics types. STAX excels across numerous critical applications, including spatial domain identification, spatial slice integration, cohort-level spatial analysis, spatial spot completion, cell-gene co-embedding, expression profile denoising, and 3D spatial multi-slice simulation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that STAX consistently delivers superior performance, robustness, and biologically meaningful interpretations, establishing it as an indispensable tool for spatial omics research. In short, STAX effectively addresses multiple analytical challenges in spatial omics, empowering researchers with a unified platform to accelerate biomedical discoveries and deepen understanding of complex biological systems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bento: Benchmarking Classical and AI Docking on Drug Design-Relevant Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pak, M. A., Frolova, D., +8 authors, Ivankov, D. N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in artificial intelligence have introduced deep learning and co-folding approaches for predicting protein-ligand complexes, raising the question of their applicability and how they compare with classical docking methods. In this work, we present a thorough benchmarking study of eleven tools for protein-ligand interaction prediction, spanning classical molecular docking methods, deep learning-based models, and co-folding algorithms. While most related benchmarking efforts primarily assess the generalization capacity, we extend the analysis to also evaluate the performance on drug design-relevant data and across different classes of protein-ligand complexes. Here, we introduce Bento, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 11 tools for protein-ligand interaction prediction - both established and recently developed - across four test datasets and multiple derived subsets in a pocket-aware setup. We show that 1) careful dataset curation is essential - filtering by pocket structural similarity and controlling ligand complexity exposes generalization failures that are obscured in conventional benchmarks; 2) classical and deep learning-based docking tools perform similarly well on drug-like ligands, making them comparably useful for virtual screening, with physics-based methods offering a clear advantage in speed; 3) co-folding tools outperform other approaches on structurally complex ligands, whereas most methods achieve similar accuracy on regular small molecules; and 4) all methods struggle to generalize to unseen pockets, with deep learning models being the most prone to overfitting. Overall, our results show that while current docking and DL-based approaches are reliable for many drug-design-relevant scenarios, genuine pocket-level generalization remains an open challenge. Bento provides a rigorous and transparent framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding the development of more robust protein-ligand prediction models. The data and code of Bento are available at https://github.com/LigandPro/Bento.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An Empirical Analysis of Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on Bioinformatics Literature: PRSGPT and BioStarsGPT</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Muneeb, M., Ascher, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) often lack specialized knowledge for complex bioinformatics applications. We present a reproducible pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs on specialized bioinformatics data, demonstrated through two use cases: PRSGPT, focused on polygenic risk score (PRS) tools, and BioStarsGPT, trained on community forum discussions. The nine-step pipeline integrates diverse data sources, structured preprocessing, prompt-based question-answer (QA) generation (via Google Gemini), natural language inference (NLI) for quality control, semantic deduplication, clustering-based data splitting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA. We fine-tuned three LLMs (LLaMA-3.2-3B, Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma) and benchmarked them on over 14 lexical and semantic metrics. Qwen2.5-7B emerged as the best performer, with BLEU-4 and ROUGE-1 improvements of 82% and 70% for PRSGPT and 6% and 18% for BioStarsGPT, respectively. The open-source datasets produced include over 28,000 QA pairs for PRSGPT and 154,282 for BioStarsGPT. Human evaluation of PRSGPT yielded 61.9% accuracy on the PRS tools comparison task, comparable to Google Gemini (61.4%), but with richer methodological detail and accurate citations. BioStarsGPT demonstrated 59% conceptual accuracy across 142 curated bioinformatics questions. Our pipeline enables scalable, domain-specific fine-tuning of LLMs. It enables privacy-preserving, locally deployable bioinformatics assistants, explores their practical applications, and addresses the challenges, limitations, and mitigation strategies associated with their development and use.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multimodal AI for Single cfDNA Profiling and Cancer Screening</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, B., Song, L., +18 authors, Ye, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) serves as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer detection, but conventional methods face challenges due to the ultra-low abundance of tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) among normal cfDNA. Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Generative Reconstruction of Unobserved Cellular Dynamics using Single-Cell Transcriptomic Trajectories</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ray, S., Das Mandal, S., +1 author, Pyne, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The primary challenge in cellular dynamics is to capture the intermediate states between two distinct biological stages. This is because of the technical constraints in capturing transient states or the nature of single-cell sequencing protocols. To address this challenge, we introduce a new computational framework, GRAIL (Generative Reconstruction of Artificial Intermediate Lineages), which aims to bridge these missing transitions. GRAIL reconstructs biologically plausible intermediate cell states between two distinct developmental stages (A and B) through a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based cell selection strategy followed by a smooth interpolation in learned latent space. The interpolated latent representations are subsequently decoded into gene expression profiles using a trained generator from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The framework consists of three components: (a) a pretrained autoencoder that learns latent representations of stage specific transcriptomes, (b) an LSH-guided interpolation procedure that identifies anchor cells and performed interpolation in latent space, and (c) a GAN generator that extrapolates realistic intermediate expression from the interpolated samples consistent with the underlying trajectory. We benchmarked GRAIL with different state-of-the-arts (SOTA) in diverse setup of simulated dataets as well as in real life scRNA-seq datasets. Generated samples from GRAIL preserve expected marker gene expression patterns and also improve downstream analyses, including differential expression and cell clustering. Our method addresses the critical gap in studying cellular transitions when experimental intermediate samples are unavailable.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NLRP3 Inflammasome Exhibits Context-Dependent Roles in Glioblastoma-Astrocyte Crosstalk</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rajkhowa, S., Sha, L., +7 authors, Jha, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by molecular and cellular heterogeneity and poor patient survival. NLRP3 inflammasome regulates inflammation and cell death with context-specific roles in cancer, but its functions in GBM tumour and astrocyte interactions remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed NLRP3 expression and function in GBM cell lines (LN-229 and LN18), astrocytes (SVG), patient-derived tissues, and organoids. Basal NLRP3 expression was higher in astrocytes than in GBM cells and increased after LPS stimulation, altering astrocyte morphology and NLRP3 subcellular localization. siRNA-mediated silencing of NLRP3 reduced GBM proliferation, migration, and viability in GBM cells, while enhancing proliferation and cytokine secretion in astrocytes, highlighting its context-dependent effects. NLRP3 deficiency exhibited reciprocal cytokine paracrine signaling, with GBM cells releasing elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-, and astrocytes releasing elevated levels of IL-1{beta}. Glyburide treatment reduced NLRP3 expression and IL-1{beta} release in GBM cells but elevated NLRP3 and IL-1{beta} in astrocytes. Overall, these data reveal NLRP3's dual roles in GBM-astrocyte crosstalk, suggesting cell-type-selective inhibition for therapeutic exploration.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Translational control of AMPK activity in melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vadovicova, N., Leskova, A., +9 authors, Uldrijan, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The eIF4F translation initiation complex controls ERK MAPK signaling in malignant melanomas with BRAF and NRAS mutations. It also contributes to the development of melanoma resistance to therapies targeting BRAF and MEK kinases. Here, we uncovered a critical role for eIF4F in regulating the main cellular metabolic sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In melanoma cells with the most common BRAF V600E mutation, ERK and AMPK pathway activities were reported as mutually exclusive. This is because BRAF -driven ERK activity negatively impacts LKB1-mediated canonical AMPK activation. However, we observed that eIF4F inhibition can stimulate AMPK activity in melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo, despite concomitant ERK hyperactivation. Notably, the protein levels of LKB1 and its co-factor MO25 were sensitive to eIF4F inhibition, indicating a non-canonical LKB1-independent mechanism of AMPK activation. In a proteomic screen, we aimed to identify eIF4F roles in melanoma cell physiology beyond the MAPK pathway. We found that the eIF4F function is essential for maintaining cellular levels of key cell cycle and metabolic regulators, including CDK1, CDK2, TYMS, and UHRF1. Importantly, we also identified the protein phosphatase PP2A as a new eIF4F target. Our subsequent analyses showed that inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PP2A increases AMPK activity in melanoma cells, independent of LKB1. This data shows that PP2A plays a significant role in regulating AMPK activity in melanoma. Thus, eIF4F inhibition not only impairs canonical AMPK activators but also downregulates PP2A, which negatively regulates AMPK dynamics. Collectively, our data highlight a dual role of eIF4F in the control of AMPK in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. It maintains the canonical AMPK signaling pathway while simultaneously limiting the extent of AMPK activation via the eIF4F-PP2A-AMPK axis. Pharmacological inhibition of this axis can overcome the negative control of AMPK signaling by the ERK pathway. This suggests new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt melanoma growth.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Glycomimetic Lysosome-targeting Chimeras (GLYTACs) for Degradation of Growth Factors and Growth Factor Receptors in Cancer Cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Follmar, J. L., Tabuchi, T., Godula, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many cancers depend on extracellular growth factors within the tumor microenvironment to drive aberrant signaling, prolifer-ation, and survival. For example, anticancer therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor activity have been effective in blocking pro-angiogenic and pro-growth signals, including receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., Sunitinib and Soraf-enib) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Bevacizumab). However, the effectiveness of these therapies is frequently limited by compensatory growth factor signaling and incomplete blockade, contributing to drug resistance and suboptimal long-term responses. To address these challenges, we developed Glycomimetic Lysosome-targeting Chimeras (GLYTACs) that se-quester and degrade extracellular growth factors in the cancer cell environment. GLYTACs exploit growth factor interactions with cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) glycans, a feature shared by many pro-tumorigenic signals and their receptors, by com-bining an HS-glycomimetic arm for growth factor binding with a polyvalent glycopolymer ligand targeting the lysosomal recycling cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) for efficient internalization and degradation. Treating HeLa cells with a heparin-based GLYTAC prototype drove rapid uptake and degradation of extracellular fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The capacity of heparin to promote the association of FGF2 with its cognate receptors (FGFRs) led to the degradation of the entire receptor-ligand complex, thereby reducing the availability of FGFRs at the cancer cell surface, which are necessary for sustained pro-oncogenic signaling. These findings highlight the potential of GLYTACs as an alternative to existing growth factor blocking anticancer therapies and as a strategy to reshape the extracellular signaling environment of tumors.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Similarity-guided swarm of models: enhancing semi-supervised learning in computational pathology.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhilong Weng, Alexey Pryalukhin, +7 authors, Yuri Tolkach</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-precision pixel-level annotation has been a major bottleneck in computational pathology due to its time-consuming nature and reliance on expert knowledge. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a promising approach to alleviate this challenge by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data. However, existing pseudo-labeling-based SSL methods often overlook intrinsic properties, such as inter-case similarities, which are critical for generating accurate pseudo-labels in complex tissue environments. In this study, we propose a Swarm-of-Models (S-o-M) SSL framework that dynamically selects "morphology expert" models (i.e., models specialized in recognizing specific tissue structures) for each unlabeled whole-slide image (WSI) based on similarity, thereby improving the reliability of pseudo-labeling for semantic segmentation tasks. In an evaluation on a large international dataset (multi-class tissue segmentation algorithm for colorectal domain), our approach outperforms traditional supervised and semi-supervised strategies by improving the Dice score by 3.6% for tumor segmentation and 2.1% for tumor/tumor stroma segmentation. Ablation studies performed with different numbers of annotated and unannotated WSIs, as well as training in a monocentric training scenario, further confirm the robustness and superior performance of the proposed S-o-M framework. These findings highlight the value of incorporating case-to-case similarities into SSL strategies to build more effective and general computational pathology models.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine Learning-Driven Extracellular Vesicles Peptidomics Powers Precision Classification of Endometrial Cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yunhan Yang, Dandan Li, +7 authors, Liang Qiao</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Endometrial cancer (EC) molecular subtyping is critical for prognosis and treatment but remains hindered by reliance on invasive tissue biopsies and time-consuming genomic sequencing. Here, we present a minimally invasive approach integrating MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS-based peptidomic profiling of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) with machine learning for rapid EC screening and subtyping. EVs were isolated from EC patients and controls, and their peptidome fingerprints were analyzed. A machine learning model utilizing 12 discriminative MALDI-TOF MS features, the levels of CA125 and HE4, and clinical features related to cancer risk achieved an AUC of 0.867 in distinguishing EC from the controls. For molecular subtyping (POLE mutant, NSMP, MMRd, P53-abnormal), a multiclassification model demonstrated micro/macro-averaged AUCs of 0.91/0.90. LC-MS/MS identified 7,479 peptides, with fibrinogen α chain (FGA), protease serine 3 (PRSS3), and apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) emerging as key biomarkers linked to specific subtypes. This study establishes a high-throughput, cost-effective platform for EC management, bridging translational gaps in precision oncology.</p>
