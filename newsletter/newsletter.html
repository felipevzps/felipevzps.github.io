<h2 class="paper-title">DoReMiTra: An R/Bioconductor data package for orchestrating the analysis of radiation transcriptomic studies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Salah, A., Zahnreich, S., Marini, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Summary: Understanding the molecular impact of ionizing radiation exposure is essential for both biomedical research and public health. Among the possible approaches to study this phenomenon, gene expression profiling via transcriptomics assays has been a valuable approach over the last decades to unravel the mechanisms of cellular responses to radiation. To our knowledge, there is no data package gathering well-curated radiation transcriptomic datasets covering microarrays and, more recently, RNA sequencing. Therefore, we present DoReMiTra, an R/Bioconductor data package that represents the first unified radiation transcriptomics dataset collection integrated with Bioconductor's ExperimentHub for efficient distribution. DoReMiTra standardizes and harmonizes sample-level metadata and provides pre-processed SummarizedExperiment (SE) objects to facilitate comparative analyses. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight Shiny app interface for interactive visualization and preliminary exploration. DoReMiTra serves as a valuable resource and tool in radiation research for benchmarking, integrative analyses, and biomarker discovery. Availability and Implementation: DoReMiTra is available under the MIT license at https://bioconductor.org/packages/DoReMiTra.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SpaCEy: Discovery of Functional Spatial Tissue Patterns by Association with Clinical Features Using Explainable Graph Neural Networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rifaioglu, A. S., Ervin, E. H., +4 authors, Saez-Rodriguez, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tissues are complex ecosystems tightly organized in space. This organization influences their function, and its alteration underpins multiple diseases. Spatial omics allows us to profile its molecular basis, but how to leverage these data to link spatial organization and molecular patterns to clinical practice remains a challenge. We present SpaCEy (SpatialClinicalExplainability), an explainable graph neural network that uncovers organizational tissue patterns predictive of clinical outcomes. SpaCEy learns directly from molecular marker expression by modelling tissues as spatial graphs of cells and their interactions, without requiring predefined cell types or anatomical regions. Its embeddings capture intercellular relationships and molecular dependencies that enable accurate prediction of variables such as overall survival and disease progression. SpaCEy integrates a specialized explainer module that reveals recurring spatial patterns of cell organisation and coordinated marker expression that are most relevant to predictions of the models. Applied to a spatially resolved proteomic lung cancer cohort, SpaCEy discovers distinct spatial arrangements of cells together with coordinated expression of protein markers associated with disease progression. Across multiple breast cancer proteomic datasets, it consistently stratifies patients according to overall survival, both across and within established clinical subtypes. SpaCEy also highlights spatial patterns of a small set of key protein markers underlying this patient stratification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Population-Scale Single-Cell Atlas of the Human Heart Reveals Cellular Remodeling and Cell-Cell Communication in Aging and Cardiac Disease</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gong, Z., Li, M., +7 authors, Chen, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous single-cell and single-nucleus heart atlases, often limited by small sample sizes, lack the statistical power needed for phenotype association analysis, particularly for cardiovascular diseases and cardiac aging. To address this, we integrated data from 436 samples across 12 single-cell studies, harmonized the corresponding sample metadata, and constructed a comprehensive heart atlas comprising 355,762 cells and 1,436,719 nuclei. Consensus annotation identified 10 broad cell types and 54 fine-grained subsets. Associating gene expression patterns and cell type proportions with phenotypic data, we identified NRG1-expressing endocardial cells linked to multiple cardiac diseases and found that interferon (IFN) response signatures mark aging in multiple heart cell types. Importantly, we also developed PopComm, a novel computational method for inferring ligand-receptor (LR) interactions from population-scale single-cell data and quantifying interaction strength for individual samples. Using PopComm, we revealed a close association between the IFN response state and altered cell-cell communication during cardiac aging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DeepDOX1: A Dual-Drive Framework Integrating Deep Learning and First-Principles Physics for Drug-Protein Affinity Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Z., Sun, H., +8 authors, Wan, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we present DeepDOX1, a dual-drive drug-protein affinity (DPA) prediction tool features the tight integration of a concise AI architecture and a quantum mechanics based representation. The first-principle physics generated features incorporating the interactions between the drug and the protein pocket allows a relatively simple CNN model trained on a relatively small training set to exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across extensive testing. Notably, DeepDOX1 outperforms popular AI models in the tests simulating real-world drug design scenario and a highly challenging test set featuring covalent ligands, halogenated ligands and metalloproteins. In addition, we designed a series of novel covalent inhibitors targeting the diabetes target hu-FBPase using DeepDOX1. Subsequent experimental validation including enzyme-level bioactivity assays and crystal structure determination confirmed the DeepDOX1's effectiveness in real-world drug design applications. It is conceivable that the combination of AI and first-principle QM might be one of the next breakthrough points of DPA prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MisTIC: Missegmented Transcript Inference Correction for Improved Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, Y., DePasquale, E. A., +6 authors, Wang, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Imaging-based spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies, such as 10X Xenium, MERSCOPE, and CosMx, have revolutionized our ability to study gene expression within the spatial context of tissues at single-cell resolution. The acquisition of such data relies heavily on cell segmentation algorithms, which often produce imperfect boundaries, leading to transcript misassignment. These misassignments can significantly affect downstream analyses, including cell type identification, differential expression analysis, cell-cell communication, and RNA localization. We present MisTIC (Missegmented Transcript Inference Correction), a variational Bayesian model designed to correct transcript misassignment errors without requiring resegmentation. In benchmarking analyses using synthetic data with simulated transcript misassignment, MisTIC demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in removing misassigned transcripts. In real data applications, MisTIC effectively enhances cell type identification, reduces ambiguity in differential expression analysis, and improves the detection of cell-cell communication. Furthermore, RNA localization analysis based on data corrected by MisTIC revealed that, in T cells located near cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to those farther away, genes involved in T cell activation, inflammation, and cytotoxicity were depleted from cytoplasmic regions despite not being differentially expressed between the two T cell subsets. In conclusion, MisTIC is a powerful tool for correcting transcript misassignment in SRT data. It not only improves the accuracy of routine analyses but also enables novel investigations that provide deeper insights into the dynamics of gene expression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Increasing the predictive accuracy of the Resistance Gene Identifier by evaluating antimicrobial resistance gene over- and underprediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mukiri, K. M., Alcock, B. P., +1 author, McArthur, A. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational biology is paving the way towards accessible antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene (ARG) detection methods to complement canonical gold-standard phenotypic diagnostics for the purposes of antimicrobial surveillance. However, obtaining an accurate depiction of phenotypic resistance through genotypic methods requires addressing potential over- and underprediction of ARGs. This study assessed the manual curation accuracy of bit-score cutoff values associated with bioinformatic models within the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and the subsequent effects of erroneous cutoff curation, leading to potential Type I and Type II error, on its in silico resistome prediction tool, the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI). CARD models rarely overpredicted (5 of 3,900 models with &gt;5% false positive rates) but somewhat underpredicted (739 of 3,900 models with &gt;5% false negative rates) resistance-associated sequences and mutations, emphasizing RGI's conservative prediction algorithms. Isolating curation inaccuracies by AMR gene family, efflux-related families were the main contributors to overprediction (likely due to human curation error), while underprediction was primarily due to beta-lactamase families, the latter finding highlighting systemic curation deficiencies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">scPRINT-2: Towards the next-generation of cell foundation models and benchmarks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kalfon, J., Peyre, G., Cantini, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell biology has been booming with foundation models trained on large single-cell RNA-seq databases, but benchmarks and capabilities remain unclear. We propose an additive benchmark across a gymnasium of tasks to discover which features improve performance. From these findings, we present scPRINT-2, a single-cell Foundation Model pre-trained across 350 million cells and 16 organisms. Our contributions in pre-training tasks, tokenization, and losses made scPRINT-2 state-of-the-art in expression denoising, cell embedding, and cell type prediction. Furthermore, with our cell-level architecture, scPRINT-2 becomes generative, as demonstrated by our expression imputation and counterfactual reasoning results. Finally, thanks to our pre-training database, we uncover generalization to unseen modalities and organisms. These studies, together with improved abilities in gene embeddings and gene network inference, place scPRINT-2 as a next-generation cell foundation model.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Discovery of a stress-response integrative and conjugative element from Sphingopyxis granuli TFA broadly conserved across Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Garcia-Romero, I., Santos-Diaz, G., +4 authors, Rubio, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Horizontal gene transfer is a pivotal element in the evolution of microbes, enabling them to acquire novel genes and phenotypes. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are a type of mobile genetic element that can integrate into the host genome and propagate during chromosome replication and cell division. The induction of ICE gene expression results in the excision of the ICE gene, the production of conserved conjugation machinery, a Type IV Secretion System, and the potential for DNA transfer to appropriate receptors. It has been observed that ICEs frequently contain cargo genes that do not typically align with the ICE life cycle. These genes often result in the manifestation of phenotypes that are of particular interest. The bacterium Sphingopyxis granuli strain TFA is being studied for its ability to degrade the contaminant tetralin present in crude oils. Genomic analysis identified eight possible integrative mobile elements in S. granuli TFA. Most of these regions exhibited a distribution pattern that was restricted to the species, and they lacked some functional modules that are characteristic of a complete ICE. This finding suggests the presence of degenerate structures or limited mobilization capacity. However, only two of the detected elements exhibited the capacity to retain all the modules necessary for transfer, integration, and maintenance. These elements also contained a cargo module that included genes associated with lipid metabolic pathways and resistance mechanisms. Among them, ICE3 was distinguished as the sole complete functional ICE that was also present in other species. Transcriptomic analysis under multiple stress conditions revealed differential and consistent activation of ICE3 genes, demonstrating their direct contribution to bacterial resilience and suggesting a key adaptive role in response to adverse environmental changes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">scCotag: Diagonal integration of single-cell multi-omics data via prior-informed co-optimal transport and regularized barycentric mapping</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Y., Tan, Y., +10 authors, Yin, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell technologies have enabled characterization of cellular states across distinct omics layers, yielding complementary insights into the organization of biological systems. To jointly leverage these disparate modalities, computational methods have been developed to align non-overlapping cell populations profiled in different omics layers, a task known as diagonal integration, thereby facilitating more fine-grained biological interpretations. However, existing integration approaches unrealistically assume that all cells are alignable and treat prior-knowledge-derived feature correspondences as fully reliable, retaining them unrefined throughout the alignment process. In this work, we introduce scCotag, a co-optimal transport (COOT)-based deep learning framework for diagonal integration of single-cell multi-omics data, to address these limitations. scCotag first infers cell alignment and feature correspondence with prior-informed COOT in an iterative manner, and then leverages the resulting transport plans to jointly learn cell and feature embeddings via regularized barycentric mapping and graph reweighting. Systematic benchmarking on human brain, bone marrow, and blood single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets demonstrates the overall superior performance of scCotag over state-of-the-art methods in both cell alignment accuracy and embedding accuracy. In particular, scCotag excels in simulated imbalance scenarios where not all cells are alignable. Applying scCotag to data in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD (NoAD) patients further yields more fine-grained biological interpretation of regulatory mechanisms. Together, these results demonstrate that scCotag provides a robust framework for single-cell diagonal integration and regulatory inference.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Head, R. D., Barve, R. A., +7 authors, Kuster, D. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As molecular and cellular technologies have advanced, the need to analyze and interpret the resulting, often vast and multi-modal, data into actionable intelligence has become a rate-limiting factor in scientific advancement. While traditional knowledgebase-pathway tools and LLM-based AI tools both provide a degree of support in data interpretation, both exhibit limitations. Presented here is the CompBio multi-omic analysis platform built upon a novel memory-based intelligence engine, MIRaS. The system is not dependent on human-curated pathway knowledgebases, can perform statistical significance analysis, does not suffer from hallucination, and produces traceable results. Furthermore, substantial effort has been placed in the computer-human knowledge transfer components of the system to enable efficient interaction, interpretation, and learning. The system has undergone years of extensive testing, validation, and evolution in omics-based research with dozens of associated publications verifying its effectiveness. A systematic assessment of CompBio and a detailed description of the MIRaS method are provided.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">miRISC inhibition causes mitotic defects and synergizes with genotoxic agents in cancers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, M., Jiao, Z., +25 authors, La Rocca, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although individual microRNAs (miRNAs) can have tumorigenic or tumor-suppressive properties, their overall role in cancer remains controversial. Here, we show that cancer tissues and cell lines are characterized by preferential accumulation of the high-molecular-weight miRNA-induced silencing complex (HMWR), the functionally active form of the effector complex responsible for miRNA-mediated gene repression. Experimentally induced disassembly of the HMWR impairs the growth of human tumor xenografts and of autochthonous tumors in mouse models of human cancer in vivo. Furthermore, disassembly of the HMWR increases chromosome mis-segregation, which synergized with genotoxic agents to potentiate cancer cell vulnerability and improve therapeutic response. These findings suggest pharmacologic inhibition of HMWR as a novel anti-cancer strategy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cystathionine Beta-Synthase Promotes Anoikis Resistance and Transcoelomic Metastasis in Ovarian Cancer via the SP1-ITGB1 axis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shaw, P., Dey Bhowmik, A., +9 authors, Rao, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Anoikis resistance is crucial for ovarian cancer (OvCa) transcoelomic metastasis, during which exfoliated OvCa cells survive as spheroids before invading the omentum. Here, we demonstrate that cystathionine Beta-synthase (CBS), an H2S-producing transsulfuration pathway enzyme, is a key determining factor of OvCa spheroidal viability and metastatic potential. Analysis of publicly available patient datasets, as well as an in-house tissue microarray revealed that high CBS expression positively correlates with poor progression-free survival and clinically observed peritoneal/omental metastasis. Integrated functional and proteomic analyses indicated that CBS silencing induces apoptosis in 2D monolayers. Consistent with this, CBS silencing in spheroids caused apoptosis along and disrupted spheroid architecture. Mechanistically, this phenotype was associated with downregulation of oncogenic stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Further, through proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, we identified ITGB1 to be the hub protein in OvCa spheroidogenesis. Interestingly, knockdown of CBS led to abrogation of the ITGB1-mediated downstream pathway. Moreover, by proteomic and network analyses, we identified SP1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CBS-induced pro-spheroidal transcriptional programs of stemness and invasiveness. Stabilization of SP1 through persulfidation by H2S supplementation restored spheroidal viability and underlying protein signaling. Further, our results reveal that loss of CBS through ITGB1 repression disrupts spheroid architecture, leading to reduced metastatic docking on the murine omental surface in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish CBS as a central regulator of anoikis resistance and OvCa transcoelomic dissemination, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the CBS-SP1-ITGB1 axis to attenuate metastatic spread.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Immune-mediated Engagement of T Regulatory Cells with Tumor Cells Results in Trogocytosis and Tumor Cell Killing.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Erbe, A. K., Feils, A. S., +18 authors, Sondel, P. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite advances in treatment, &gt;50% of patients with advanced melanoma are unresponsive to current therapies. Using the B78-D14 melanoma model (GD2+/MHC-I-/MHC-II+), we can cure mice with a regimen that includes radiotherapy (RT) in combination with immunocytokine (IC; anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody linked to IL-2) while establishing immunological memory. We interrogated the role of T cells in the antitumor and memory responses following RT+IC. We show a requirement for CD4, but not CD8 T cells, to achieve both the initial and memory responses. Upon IC-induced cell-cell contact, subsets of CD4 T cells, including Foxp3 T regulatory cells, trogocytose GD2 from tumor cells, acquire cytotoxic granules, and kill tumor cells. These results were confirmed using human tumor cell lines. These findings reveal that CD4 T regulatory cells, upon immunologically-induced binding to tumor cells, can trogocytose tumor antigens and directly kill tumor cells, redefining their potential role in antitumor immunity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A window trial in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma reveals resistance mechanisms to targeting the KRAS-MEK pathway</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tsuda, M., Keith, D., +42 authors, Sears, R. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Copy number alterations of KRAS, mutated in over 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), and MYC occur in 30-40% of PDAC. Here we demonstrate that KRAS and MYC are frequently co-gained and accompanied with worse prognosis in PDAC. In a Window-of-Opportunity clinical trial for metastatic PDAC, serial biopsies and deep multi-omics analyses were utilized to explore resistance mechanisms to MEK inhibition, as a surrogate for KRAS inhibition. Tumors from four of 14 patients showed Ki-67/CA19-9-based biomarker response (BR). Non-BR tumors were enriched for KRAS/MYC co-gain and KRASG12D variant. A transcriptomic signature of BR tumors was inversely correlated with KRASG12D/MYC co-gain in a large PDAC dataset and predictive for KRAS inhibitor response in multiple models. Finally, co-targeting KRAS and MYC was synergistic in KRASG12D/MYC co-gain PDAC. Together, this study provides insight into KRAS inhibitor resistance and supports MYC as an important target to improve patient outcomes in this deadly disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Plasma plasmalogen levels and risk of lymph node positive breast cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yavari, M., Brantley, K. D., +20 authors, Ubellacker, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lymph node involvement is a key predictor of poor breast cancer prognosis. Systemic lipid alterations can contribute to cancer cell survival in lymph nodes, but their relevance in humans remains unclear. Here, we combine human epidemiologic analyses from the Nurses Health Study 2 and complementary mechanistic studies in mouse models to investigate how systemic lipid profiles relate to lymph node positive breast cancer. We show that in pre-diagnostic human plasma (n=511), lower levels of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)-enriched plasmalogens are associated with increased risk of lymph node positivity, with stronger associations in samples collected closer to diagnosis. Consistent with the human data, lower levels of PE and PC-enriched plasma plasmalogens are found in mice with nodal involvement. Furthermore, in mice, dietary PUFA depletion reduces lipid oxidation in breast cancer cells in lymph nodes and promotes their survival and metastatic spread. These findings suggest that reduced levels of PE and PC-plasmalogens and decreased PUFA availability creates a lipid environment that enables breast cancer lymph node involvement.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">An open-source screening platform accelerates discovery of drug combinations.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">William C Wright, Min Pan, +12 authors, Paul Geeleher</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drug combinations are essential to modern medicine, but their discovery remains slow and inefficient as experimental complexity expands rapidly with each additional drug tested. Although modern liquid handling systems enable complex and highly customizable experimental designs, a lack of strategies integrating these technologies with combination-specific analytical methods has limited throughput. Here we introduce Combocat, an open-source and streamlined framework that combines acoustic liquid handling protocols with machine learning-based inference to achieve ultrahigh-throughput drug combination screening. Using Combocat, we generate a reference dataset of over 800 unique combinations in a dense 10 × 10 matrix format across multiple cell types, and use this to train a predictive model that accurately infers drug combination effects from sparse data, drastically reducing the number of experimental measurements required. As proof of concept, we screened 9,045 combinations in a neuroblastoma cell line-the largest number of combinations tested in a single cell line to date-achieved using minimal resources. By integrating advanced drug dispensing technologies with predictive computational modeling, Combocat provides a scalable solution to accelerate the discovery of novel drug combinations.</p>
