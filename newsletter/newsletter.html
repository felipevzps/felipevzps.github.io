<h2 class="paper-title">Deciphering Cellular Ecosystems Driving Tumor Progression and Immune Escape from Spatial Transcriptomics and Single-Cell with COMPOTES</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Herpin, L., Chossegros, A., +12 authors, Bayard, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell-cell communication is central to understanding the complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment. However, current methods fail to identify recurrent communication patterns across patient cohorts from spatial transcriptomics, as they are often limited to single samples or lack essential spatial context. Yet this is essential for understanding how local environments influence cell phenotype and states, and shape the entire cellular ecosystem. We introduce a machine-learning approach that models local, spatially aware ligand-receptor interactions and uses matrix factorization to extract global multicellular programs from large cohorts representing the complex biology of cancer. Applied to a multimodal muscle-invasive bladder cancer cohort of 146 patients, it uncovered 45 communication programs defined by distinct ligand-receptor pairs and cellular niches. In particular, we identified a conserved immune program linked to stalled anti-tumor immunity and a program linking KMT2D loss-of-function mutations with early-stage (T2) tumors, intense proliferation and a favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Unified Protein Embedding Model with Local and Global Structural Sensitivity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xu, J., Pei, S., Alterovitz, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structural comparison between proteins is key to many research tasks, including evolutionary analysis, peptidomimetics, and functional annotation. Traditional structure alignment tools based on three-dimensional protein structures, such as TM-Align, DALI, or ProBiS, are accurate, but they are computationally expensive and impractical at scale. Existing protein language models (PLMs), such as TM-Vec, improve computational efficiency but only capture global structural similarity, overlooking important motif-level structural details. In this paper, we propose a novel PLM consisting of a Siamese neural network, enabling efficient embedding-based structural comparison while also capturing both global and local structural similarity. Our model was trained on a dual loss function combining TM-score, a global similarity metric, and a variation of lDDT scores, a per-residue similarity metric. We tested against two datasets: a varied TM-score dataset from TM-Vec, and a high TM-score mutant dataset from VIPUR. Against these sets, our model achieved a TM-score MAE of 0.0741 and 0.0583, respectively, and a lDDT-score MAE of 0.0788 and 0.0038, respectively. Our model fulfills two key roles: first, it rapidly detects global structural differences. Second, it supports fine-grained structural assessments, improving sensitivity to subtle but functionally important structural changes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">omicML: An Integrative Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Framework for Transcriptomic Biomarker Identification</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Debnath, J. P., Hossen, K., +6 authors, Hossain, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introduction: Transcriptomic biomarker discovery has been a challenge due to variation in datasets and platforms, complexity in statistical and computational methods, integration of multiple programming languages, and intricacy of ML workflow to evaluate biomarkers. Standard workflows necessitate several stages (quality control, normalization, differential expression), typically executed in R or Python, resulting in bottlenecks for non-experts. Existing platforms have alleviated certain challenges by offering graphical interfaces for data loading, normalization, differential gene expression analysis, and functional analysis; nevertheless, they typically do not incorporate integrated machine learning procedures for biomarker selection. Method: In this regard, we present omicML, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that combines transcriptomic data analysis with machine learning (ML)-based classification via integrating R and Python packages/libraries. It supports both RNA-Seq and microarray data, automating preprocessing (data import, quality control, and normalization) and differential expression analysis. The tool annotates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with descriptions, gene ontology, and pathway information and incorporates comparative analysis. Our extensive ML pipeline enables both supervised and unsupervised learning, integrates various datasets based on candidate gene signatures, standardizes and eliminates less significant features, benchmarks multiple ML classifiers with robust performance metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPRC), assesses feature importance, develops single-gene and multi-gene predictive models, and systematically finalizes the biomarker algorithm. All functionalities are available in omicML, hence reducing the barrier for biologists without computational proficiency. Result: In a case study, omicML identified a six-gene diagnostic model that distinguishes Mpox (monkeypox virus) infections from those caused by other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, and varicella-zoster. These results illustrate omicML's capacity to discern clinically relevant biomarkers from complex transcriptome data. Conclusion: Through the unified system, omicML (https://omicml.org), integrating data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, annotation, heatmap analysis, dataset integration, batch effect correction, machine learning approach, and functional analysis can diminish technical barriers and accelerates the conversion of expression data into diagnostic insights for clinicians and bench scientists.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Constrained Evolutionary Funnels Shape Viral Immune Escape</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Huot, M., WANG, D., +2 authors, Cocco, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how viral proteins adapt under immune pressure while preserving structural viability is crucial for anticipating the emergence of antibody-resistant variants. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that predicts the evolutionary trajectories of viral escape, revealing immune evasion is funneled through a remarkably small number of viable paths compared to total mutational space. These escape funnels arise from the combined constraints of protein viability and escape from antibodies, which we model using a generative model trained on structural homologs and deep mutational scanning data. We derive a mean-field approximation of evolutionary path ensembles, enabling us to quantify both the fitness and entropy of escape routes. Applied to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, our framework reveals convergent evolution patterns, accurately predicts mutation sites in emerged variants of concern, and explains the differential effectiveness of antibody cocktails. In particular, we show that combinations of antibodies with de-correlated escape profiles slow viral adaptation by increasing the mutational effort and viability cost required for escape.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic multicolor antigen-stabilizable nanobody platform for intersectional labelling and functional imaging.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Barykina, N. V., Carey, E. M., +3 authors, Verkhusha, V. V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a synthetic toolkit of antigen-stabilizable fluorescent nanobodies (VIS-Fbs) spanning the entire visible spectrum from 450 nm to 660 nm. By engineering over twenty fluorescent proteins (FPs) and biosensors into eight nanobodies, we established a generalizable design of VIS-Fbs, which fluoresce brightly only upon binding to cognate antigens. Our synthetic approach includes constitutive, photoactivatable and photoswitchable FPs, and intensiometric FP-based biosensors. VIS-Fbs carrying biosensors enable simultaneous monitoring of two metabolites at confined locations, while FP-based VIS-Fbs targeting biosensors allow ratiometric functional imaging in the mouse brain. We further used VIS-Fbs to track endogenous {beta}-catenin dynamics in zebrafish embryos during normal development and under Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling modulation. VIS-Fbs provide background-free visualization of intracellular proteins, multicolor detection of multiple antigens, and selective targeting of defined cell populations and compartments. This synthetic biology-driven platform enables precise studies of protein dynamics, cellular processes, and complex biological systems with high specificity and minimal background.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A database of biological thermal performances</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lopez, A., Arroyo, J. I., +4 authors, West, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We built a database of thermal performance curves that includes different variables -mostly population growth rates -for species in representative groups across major domains, including viruses, bacteria, archaea, unicellular eukaryotes (such as fungi), and multicellular eukaryotes (including plants and both invertebrates and vertebrates). To build the database, we integrated previous databases and compiled additional data from individual studies, all of which were normalized to the same units when corresponding. Our database contains data for 1300 curves across 1125 different species and 38 variable types. The database consists of four (.csv) tables and an R code that can be explored through an R package or a Shiny app. Applications of our dataset include providing a resource to studies in thermal ecology and integration with other types of data, such as geographic temperatures. This would allow us to make further predictions, such as potential species distributions based on their thermal tolerances and their changes with climate warming.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TRANCERs: Engineering enhancers into autonomous tissue-specific expression cassettes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Barrow Molina, E. K., Smith, A. L., +4 authors, Hughes, J. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The process by which a foreign gene is introduced into a cell and translated into a functional protein is referred to as transgene expression. Understanding and optimising transgene expression is crucial for a wide variety of applications which range from investigating basic biology, synthetic biology, recombinant protein production to gene therapy. However, precise control over the timing and location of transgene expression remains a key limitation, particularly in therapeutic contexts where specificity and compactness are critical. To address limitations of traditional promoter-based transgene construct approaches, we developed TRANCERs (TRanscriptionally Autonomous enhaNCERs), a modular and compact system that transforms cell type-specific enhancers into standalone sources of productive transcription. To accomplish this, we leveraged basic facets of enhancer function as well as known and novel principles of transcript stability and nuclear export. We demonstrate that TRANCERs can drive lineage-restricted expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes across multiple mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that this expression pattern faithfully mirrors the activity of the enhancer element used. Enhancer elements are the most cell type specific element in the mammalian genome and are used to drive development, differentiation and cellular responses to extrinsic signals. Therefore, the TRANCER system allows for the generation of specific stable expression constructs for all conceivable situations for which a native enhancer exists with the required activity pattern. Furthermore, we show that the TRANCER system is compatible with previously published machine learning derived artificial enhancer sequences suggesting the possibility even for specific bespoke expression patterns that do not exist in nature. This, combined with a significantly reduced vector footprint ideal for size-constrained delivery systems such as lentiviral vectors, means that the TRANCER system represent a significant step forward in our ability to control gene expression for both basic biology and therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative Biophysical Illumination of the 3D GPCRome Dynamics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Medel-Lacruz, B., Aranda-Garcia, D., +7 authors, Selent, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Achieving high-resolution insights into protein dynamics remains a major challenge, particularly for membrane proteins such as G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a highly dynamic class of cell surface receptors and key drug targets. Here, we present an integrative strategy that bridges computational and experimental biophysical methods for probing protein dynamics. To illustrate its potential, we developed GPCRmd-NMR, a platform that synergistically combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy across the 3D GPCRome. The resulting dataset maps over 20 billion NMR signals to more than 7 million conformational snapshots of GPCRs, enabling structure-resolved analysis at an unprecedented scale. Application across multiple GPCRs provides access to previously underexplored functional GPCR dynamics, receptor states, and sites, including microswitches and hidden ligand entrance gateways. Our integrated framework offers a powerful solution to long-standing challenges faced by both experimental and computational researchers. To support broad accessibility, GPCRmd-NMR is available as an open-access, web-based framework equipped with user-friendly analysis tools and is readily applicable to other dynamic protein families beyond GPCRs and other types of biophysical data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Modeling Asthma Burden in India Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Time-Varying Parameters Driven by Pollution Dynamics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bhandary, G., Kaur, G., Kumar, C. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition exacerbated by environmental pollution, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions such as India. Accurate modeling of asthma dynamics in response to pollution is challenging due to the presence of unmeasured, time-varying parameters. In this study, we develop a seven-compartment asthma pollution model incorporating susceptible, carrier, exposed, undiagnosed infected, diagnosed infected, recovered, and pollutant burden compartments. We employ a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to infer the hidden temporal profiles of key parameters, including the pollution-driven transmission rate ({xi}(t)), environmental progression rate ({lambda}1(t)), pollutant accumulation rate (A(t)), and pollutant depletion rate ({tau}t(t)), from synthetically generated noisy data. The PINN approach integrates the compartmental ODE system via a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver and minimizes a combined loss function capturing both state fidelity and parameter consistency. Evaluation of model performance demonstrates 1 excellent agreement with ground-truth trajectories, achieving mean squared errors below 10 (subscript -4) for all compartments and sub-2% deviation for inferred parameters. These results highlight the utility of PINNs for reverse function discovery in complex epidemiological systems and provide a framework for quantitatively linking environmental pollution to asthma burden in settings with limited observational data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Synthetic blood-based infrared molecular fingerprints: artificial cohorts for methodological research</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Leopold-Kerschbaumer, N., Feiler, N., Kepesidis, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Infrared molecular fingerprinting of human blood samples provides a powerful, minimally invasive approach for disease detection and health monitoring. However, ethical and legal constraints often limit the sharing of real patient data collected from clinical studies. In this work, we present a synthetic dataset of blood-based infrared molecular fingerprints, generated using multivariate Gaussian models fitted on real measurements from a large case-control study targeting various cancer types. The synthetic dataset retains the statistical and physical properties of real molecular fingerprints, enabling the development and validation of analytical methodologies without compromising patient privacy. We demonstrate that the provided artificial dataset can serve as a proxy for real data in methodological research, facilitating reproducibility and collaboration in biomedical spectroscopy. This approach offers a practical solution for overcoming ethical barriers in clinical data sharing in spectroscopic biomarker research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Somatic copy number mutations contribute to fitness in transplantation models of spontaneous human breast cancer metastasis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tran, H., Singh, G., +16 authors, Aparicio, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The contribution of somatic gene dosage mutations (CNA) to breast cancer metastasis remains poorly defined. Using 9 transplantable human neoadjuvant-naive triple-negative breast cancer xenografts, we studied the fitness of copy number clones in spontaneous metastasis from orthotopic transplant sites. Metastatic site preference was strongly patient-dependent, and the emergence of metastases exhibited a general trend toward slower growth at the orthotopic site. In our models, single-cell whole-genome sequencing of primary and metastatic sites showed that distant metastases were most often the result of minor prevalence clones at the orthotopic site, suggesting that some metastatic phenotypes may be weakly negatively fit at the primary site. We validated the existence of a fitness hierarchy of copy number clones using a previously established paradigm of remixing and retransplanting clones. Single-cell clone analysis of competitive repopulation and re-emergence of metastases showed that CNAs arising in cancer evolution can mediate metastatic fitness. Moreover, some clones displaying strong metastatic tendency exhibited weaker survival at the primary site, consistent with the notion that metastatic phenotypes could have a fitness cost at the primary site. Finally, we conducted RNA-seq analysis combined with DriverNet analysis to dissect the contribution of CNA-mediated versus genome-independent transcriptional states. CNA mutations appeared to contribute strongly to transcriptional differences between clones. Among clones of high metastatic potential, we observed CNA-mediated and CNA-independent convergence on pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), established as mediators of metastatic cell survival at distant sites. Taken together, our data point to a contribution of CNA-mediated cancer evolution to metastatic states and identify distant-site context as a key determinant of CNA-mediated fitness.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Nischarin agonist rilmenidine shows antimetastatic potential in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zivic, K., Pavlovic, M., +4 authors, Grahovac, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancer types with a dismal prognosis. Early metastatic dissemination and rich desmoplastic stroma limit therapeutic efficacy, and the discovery of new treatment approaches that will target these obstacles is of great importance. Nischarin (NISCH)/Imidazoline-1 receptor (IR-1) is a potential tumor suppressor, that is involved in the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and cytoskeletal organization. Importantly, several FDA-approved agonists target this receptor. This study aimed to examine the expression of NISCH in PDAC and the effects of its agonists with the intent of drug repurposing. NISCH was expressed in PDAC tumor tissue, in both the epithelial and stromal compartments of tumors, and higher NISCH expression was associated with longer patient survival. Out of the three tested NISCH agonists, rilmenidine was the most potent and could induce cancer cell apoptosis. Rilmenidine treatment induced transcriptional changes in cancer cells associated with so far reported NISCH function and decreased their adhesion and migration in vitro. In CAFs, rilmenidine treatment decreased the expression of activation markers and limited cancer cell-CAF cytokine communication in co-culture. Ultimately, in the in vivo tumor xenograft zebrafish model, rilmenidine reduced the metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggest that NISCH agonist rilmenidine is a promising candidate for drug repurposing as an antimetastatic agent in PDAC and that NISCH can be a potential target for the development of new PDAC therapeutics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mapping Context-Aware Phosphosite Regulation of Protein-Protein Interactions Using Deep Learning and Pan-Cancer Proteomics.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mingyue Cai, Yuqing Xiao, +4 authors, Zhongjie Liang</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phosphorylation dynamically orchestrates the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that governs cellular signaling, and its dysregulation frequently drives malignant transformation and neurodegeneration. We present PhosPPI-SEQ, an interpretable deep learning framework to identify phosphosites that functionally regulate PPIs. The model integrates a pretrained Transformer architecture with a cross-attention mechanism for fine-tuning, achieving both high predictive accuracy and biologically meaningful attention patterns. Combining PhosPPI-SEQ with a regression model based on pan-cancer multiomics data, we map context-specific phosphosites involved in PPI regulation across six cancer types, which are validated experimentally in the context of epigenetic regulation. Notably, hyperphosphorylation of HDAC1 at S421 or S423 strengthens its binding to KDM1A and correlates with poor clinical outcomes in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. A dual inhibitor targeting class I HDAC and KDM1A exhibits superior antiproliferative effects on SCLC cells expressing HDAC1 S421 or S423 phosphomimetic mutations. Our study establishes a computational-experimental paradigm for decoding phosphosites that regulate PPIs, significantly expanding the targetable PPI landscape in a phosphosite biomarker-oriented manner.</p>
