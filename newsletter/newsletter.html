<h2 class="paper-title">StrucTrace: Fourier Watermarking for Traceable Bio-molecular Assets</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, X., Huang, T. Y., +1 author, Yuan, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in protein and nucleic acid design has created unprecedented opportunities for synthetic biology, but also heightened the need for reliable provenance and intellectual-property protection. To meet this challenge, we present a Fourier domain watermarking framework that encodes digital identifiers directly into three-dimensional biomolecular structures. By perturbing only flexible backbone atoms and embedding information through frequency domain modulation, the method achieves imperceptible alterations while ensuring deterministic and reversible decoding. Large-scale validation on over 40,000 protein structures demonstrates its robustness: structural deviations remain orders of magnitude below biological thresholds, watermarks are recovered with perfect accuracy, and functional analyses confirm stability at both thermodynamic and dynamic levels. Beyond technical performance, the approach provides a foundation for a broader ecosystem of secure biomolecular asset management, integrating provenance verification, access control, and digital rights management. Together, these advances establish biomolecules as traceable and auditable digital assets, aligning the future of bio-design with emerging standards for trustworthy AI.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Biomedical Hypothesis Explainability with Graph-Based Context Retrieval</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tyagin, I., Valipour, S., +2 authors, Safro, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce an explainability method for biomedical hypothesis generation systems, built on top of the novel Hypothesis Generation Context Retriever framework. Our approach combines semantic graph-based retrieval and relevant data-restrictive training to simulate real-world discovery constraints. Integrated with large language models (LLMs) via retrieval-augmented generation, the system explains hypotheses with contextual evidence using published scientific literature. We also propose a novel feedback loop approach, which iteratively identifies and corrects flawed parts of LLM-generated explanations, refining both the evidence paths and supporting context. We demonstrate the performance of our method with multiple large language models and evaluate the explanation and context retrieval quality through both expert-curated assessment and large-scale automated analysis. Our code is available at:~url{https://github.com/IlyaTyagin/HGCR}.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatially varying cell-specific gene regulation network inference</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Y., Chen, J., Wang, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving interactions between large numbers of genes, govern expression levels of mRNA and their resulting proteins to control cell functions. As many new sequencing technologies in single-cell and spatial resolutions are raised, the construction of GRNs gains opportunities to be generalized to the cell-specific level. Here we propose SVGRN, a deep learning model to infer cell-specific GRNs using spatial transcriptomics data. We model the gene expression, GRN matrix, and spatial coordinates of cells in the structural equation model (SEM) to learn gene interactions in an unsupervised way. Conditioned on the target cell position, the model is able to tune the whole tissue GRN to the target cell through also borrowing information from neighborhood cells. Results on simulated datasets show that SVGRN achieves better performance in cases with more noises, genes, or cells, which illustrates its ability to solve more complex situations. Our model was further applied to spatial transcriptomics datasets generated using different technologies and resolutions, including a seqFISH-based mouse embryo dataset and two Visium-based datasets from human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and fallopian tube tissues. The GRNs predicted by SVGRN from these datasets reveal dynamic gene regulatory patterns in mouse organogenesis, tumor development and the functional organization of the fallopian tube, highlighting the efficiency and broad applicability of our model.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Travelling Waves in Gene Expression: A Mathematical Model of Cell-State Dynamics in Melanoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Taylor Barca, C. E., Leshem, R., +4 authors, Jensen, O. E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, known to have an ability to readily switch between different transcriptional cell states that convey different phenotypic properties (e.g. hyper-differentiated, neural crest-like). This ability is believed to underpin intratumour heterogeneity and plastic adaptation, which contributes to resistance to therapy and immune evasion of the tumour. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying acquisition of transcriptional cell states and cell state switching is crucial for the development of therapies. We model a minimal gene regulatory network comprising three key transcription factors, whose varying gene expression encodes different melanoma cell states, and use deterministic spatiotemporal differential equation models to study gene-expression dynamics. We exploit an approximation, based on cooperative binding of transcription factors, in which the models are piecewise linear. We classify stable states of the local model in a biologically relevant manner and, using a na"ive model of intercellular communication, we explore how a population of cells can take on a shared characteristic through travelling waves of gene expression. We derive a condition determining which characteristic will become dominant, which creates a partition of parameter space.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Molecular and cellular dynamics of measurable residual disease progression in myelodysplastic syndromes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, Y.-H., Bi, T., +18 authors, Bachireddy, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer relapse after treatment invariably proceeds from the persistence and progression of measurable residual disease (MRD), an ultrasmall malignant population. Despite the poor prognostic impact established by increasingly sensitive MRD detection methods, the molecular pathways defining MRD remain unknown. To identify the unique features of MRD and the molecular forces shaping its progression, we performed single-cell multi-omic profiling on DNA, RNA and protein layers for a longitudinal patient cohort with relapsed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after stem cell transplantation (SCT), the only curative modality for MDS. We provide a comprehensive molecular portrait of MRD cells with novel markers, shared across genetically heterogeneous patients. MDS relapse after SCT manifested universally with marked phenotypic evolution. Genotype and phenotype analyses revealed MRD progression as a dynamic, evolutionary process rather than a static expansionary one, driven by both subclonal sweeping and cell state transitions. Malignant cells adapted to infiltrating T cells by rewiring IFN-{gamma} responses to activate a key immunoevasive pathway. Our study demonstrates the power of longitudinal, single-cell multi-omic analysis for identifying, tracking, and understanding MRD cells, opening new avenues to target MRD persistence and progression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrative Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Hypoxia-Responsive Cell Cycle Hub Genes as Prognostic Markers in Glioblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sharma, M. K., Chongtham, J., +3 authors, Srivastava, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain malignancy, characterized by hypoxia driven proliferation, therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis. While hypoxia induced transcriptional changes are well documented, the temporal regulation of cell cycle genes under sustained hypoxia remains unclear. This study profiled transcriptomic alterations in U87MG cells cultured under normoxia and graded hypoxia for one to three days. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and analyzed using STRING, Cytoscape, MCODE, and CytoHubba to construct protein protein interaction (PPI) networks and extract hub genes. Functional enrichment was assessed through DAVID, ClueGO, and KEGG, while prognostic relevance was evaluated using GlioVis and ONCOMINE datasets. qRTPCR validated expression of selected hub genes. A total of 294 DEGs were identified, forming two main functional modules enriched in cell cycle regulation and chemokine signaling pathways. Eighteen hub genes (KIF20A, CCNB1, AURKA, EGR1, CDCA3, CENPF, CDCA2, ASPM, KIF11, CCL2, CCNA2, DLGAP5, RACGAP1, TPX2, PTGS2, CTGF, and KIFC1) were significantly associated with mitotic processes and GBM progression. Survival analysis demonstrated that 17 of these genes correlated with poor overall survival (p &lt; 0.05). qRTPCR confirmed that hub gene expression peaked during early hypoxia and declined with prolonged exposure, indicating dynamic regulatory adaptation. These findings identify key hypoxia-responsive genes governing cell cycle progression and highlight their prognostic and therapeutic potential in glioblastoma.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatially-resolved Photoproximity Profiling of MYC Identifies a MYC-BAF Liability in Cancer Cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Carlos, A., Huang, S., +6 authors, Moellering, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The c-MYC transcription factor is aberrantly expressed in most human cancers to enhance expression of proliferative gene programs. Owing to its pseudo-ordered structure and reliance on extensive and dynamic protein-protein interactions in distinct transcriptional regulatory complexes, defining context-specific MYC interactors has remained challenging. Therefore, mapping MYC-centered complex topologies in disease relevant models could identify components critical for its function which may serve as therapeutic targets in MYC-driven cancers. Here, we present a matched pair of photoproximity probes coupled with quantitative proteomics which enable context-dependent mapping of protein complex topology inside cells. We applied this spatially resolved, intracellular photoproximity (siPROX) profiling workflow to map MYC interactomes across temporal, spatial and disease-relevant contexts. Basal and inhibitor-treated profiles confirmed interactions with a wide range of known chromatin-associated transcriptional regulatory factors that define the extended MYC transcriptional bubble in live cells. Time-resolved mapping of inhibitor treated cells identified dynamic remodeling of numerous transcriptional regulatory factors and identified several BAF complex members (e.g., PBRM1 and SMARCC1)1 that persist in the presence of bromodomain inhibition. Furthermore, spatial MYC topology maps in small cell lung cancer cells confirmed the presence of BAF complex members under conditions where MYC induced target gene expression, altered cell morphology and enhanced proliferation. Lastly, loss of BAF function via inhibition of SMARCA2/4 ATPase activity resulted in rapid loss of chromatin-bound and nuclear MYC levels, downregulation of MYC-dependent transcripts and MYC-specific cell growth in several cancer cell models. Together, these data highlight the potential for siPROX to identify spatially resolved, dynamic TF interactors and highlight MYC-proximal BAF interactions as a targetable liability to regulate MYC-dependent transcription and proliferation.</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite extensive efforts to develop insulin-like growth factor (IGF1R)-targeted therapies for various malignancies, none has received clinical approval in the past two decades. Here, we reveal that N-glycan sialylation significantly decreases recognition by the humanized monoclonal anti-IGF1R antibody ganitumab across various cancer types, reducing its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Sialoforms of IGF1R are virtually absent in normal cells, indicating that the modification is tumor-specific. Pharmacological inhibition of sialyltransferases significantly sensitizes metastatic tumors to ganitumab in a ganitumab-resistant ovarian cancer model. Enzymatic removal of sialic acids from tissue sections resulted in marked enhancement in antibody binding to ovarian cancer patient tumors, but not normal tissues. Upregulation of 2-6 sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 in tumor tissues was found to be responsible for sialylation of IGF1R. Consequently, ST6GAL1-high tumors were more likely to benefit from desialylation-mediated enhancement of ganitumab binding. Furthermore, through comprehensive glycoproteomics analysis, structural prediction, and molecular dynamics simulation, we identify Asn-607 (N607) as a crucial site harboring sialylated glycans. Mechanistically, N607 glycosylation destabilizes the IGF1R-ganitumab complex. Overexpression of IGF1R Asn-607-Gln (N607Q) mutant in IGF1R-knockout cancer cells increases ganitumab efficacy compared to wild-type IGF1R in vivo. Taken together, these findings highlight sialylation as a common barrier in IGF1R-targeted therapies and provide crucial insights for therapy enhancement in cancer and patient stratification for future clinical trials.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Aberrant splicing of MBD1 reshapes the epigenome to drive convergent myeloerythroid defects in MDS</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, H. T., Joshi, P., +25 authors, Hope, K. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) feature hematopoietic deficits driven in part by transcript splicing abnormalities. Thus far, such disease-driving transcripts have been identified in association with specific splicing factor mutations. However, it remains unclear whether there also exists a set of disease-wide conserved pathological transcripts, which drive MDS independently of mutational status. Here, we characterize an MDS-associated long isoform of MBD1 (MBD1-L) as the first described member of this class of transcripts. Overexpression of MBD1-L in healthy human HSPCs recapitulates archetypal defects of MDS including deficits in erythroid differentiation and reconstitution capacity. These defects arise from an isoform-specific switching of MBD1's binding behavior, refocusing its heterochromatin-promoting activity from methylated to unmethylated CpGs and enacting broad downregulation of CpG-rich promoters as well as secondary epigenetic effects mediated by its downstream target BCOR. Remarkably, we also find that directly reversing abnormal MBD1 splicing in primary human MDS using nanoparticle-encapsulated ASOs enhances erythroid differentiation.</p>
