<h2 class="paper-title">HalluDesign: Protein Optimization and de novo Design via Iterative Structure Hallucination and Sequence design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fang, M., Wang, C., +9 authors, Cao, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning has revolutionized biomolecular modeling, enabling the prediction of diverse structures with atomic accuracy. However, leveraging the atomic-level precision of the structure prediction model for de novo design remains challenging. Here, we present HalluDesign, a general all-atom framework for protein optimization and de novo design, which iteratively update protein structure and sequence. HalluDesign harnesses the inherent hallucination capabilities of AlphaFold3-style structure prediction models and enables fine-tune free, forward-pass only sequence-structure co-optimization. Structure conditioning at different noise level in the structure prediction stage allows precise control over the sampling space, facilitating tasks from local and global protein optimization to de novo design. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by optimizing suboptimal structures, rescuing previously unsuccessful designs, designing new biomolecular interactions and generating new protein structures from scratch. Experimental characterization of binder design spanning small molecule, metal ion, protein, and antibody design of phosphorylation-specific peptide revealed high design success rates and excellent structural accuracy. Together, our comprehensive computational and experimental results highlight the broad utility of this framework. We anticipate that HalluDesign will further unlock the modeling and design potential of AlphaFold3-like models, enabling the systematic creation of complex proteins for a wide range of biotechnological applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering butyrate-producing Lachnospiraceae to treat metabolic disease</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Arnold, J., McClure, S., +7 authors, Mimee, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Engineering native gut bacteria offers a route to persistent, programmable therapeutics, yet many dominant taxa remain genetically intractable. Lachnospiraceae are a prevalent and abundant family in the human gut microbiome, possessing metabolic functions generally associated with health. Despite their promise as engineered live biotherapeutics, genetic manipulation of Lachnospiraceae remains challenging. Here, we develop a modular toolkit for Lachnospiraceae engineering, including constitutive and inducible expression and chromosomal integration systems. Applying this toolkit to the native commensal Coprococcus comes, we program secretion of the mammalian cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) in the mouse intestinal tract where it elicits ileal transcriptional responses consistent with cytokine signaling. In a mouse model of metabolic associated steatotic liver disease, IL-22-secreting C. comes improves glucose homeostasis and attenuates hepatic steatosis. This work demonstrates that a native Lachnospiraceae chassis can be genetically programmed to modulate host metabolic and immune physiology. The toolkit provides a generalizable foundation for Lachnospiraceae-derived microbiome therapeutics and for probing causal links between Lachnospiraceae gene programs and host phenotypes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Seqwin: Ultrafast Identification of Signature Sequences in Microbial Genomes</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, M. X., Kille, B., +3 authors, Treangen, T. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enables rapid, cost-effective diagnostics but requires prior identification of genomic regions that allow sensitive and specific identification of target microbial groups, herein referred to as microbial signature sequences. We introduce Seqwin, an open-source framework designed to automate microbial genome signature discovery. Tens of thousands of microbial genomes are now available, limiting the application of existing manual and automated approaches for identifying signatures. Modern approaches that are capable of leveraging all available microbial genomes will ensure sensitive and accurate DNA signatures identification and enable robust pathogen detection for clinical, environmental, and public health applications. Results: Seqwin builds weighted pan-genome minimizer graphs and uses a traversal algorithm to identify signature sequences that occur frequently in target genomes but remain rare in non-targets. Unlike earlier tools that depend on strict presence or absence of sequences, Seqwin accommodates natural sequence variation and scales to very large genome collections. When applied to genomes from C. difficile, M. tuberculosis, and S. enterica, Seqwin recovered more high-quality signatures than alternative methods with lower computational burden. Seqwin analysis of nearly 15,000 S. enterica genomes yielded over 200 candidate signatures in less than 10 minutes. Seqwin provides an open-source solution for the long-standing need for scalable microbial signature discovery and diagnostic assay design. Availability: Seqwin is freely available for academic use (https://github.com/treangenlab/Seqwin) and can be installed via Bioconda.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">TriLeukeVax: A CD80/IL-15/IL-15Rα Expressing Autologous AML Cell Vaccine Elicits Robust Anti-Leukemic Cytolytic Activity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Du, J., Wijayaratna, U. N., +6 authors, Gaensler, K. M. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is associated with poor outcomes due to frequent relapse after remission induction. While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve survival, many individuals, especially older patients, are ineligible. Prior immunotherapies have not reliably induced effective anti-leukemic immunity and have been associated with severe and unpredictable toxicities. Thus, there is a need for safe and effective therapies that reduce relapse and increase overall survival (OS). We have developed a universally applicable, patient-specific, lentivirally engineered autologous AML cell vaccine, TriLeukeVax (TLV), designed to stimulate leukemia-specific cytolytic immune responses in AML patients in remission. To generate TLV, AML cells are engineered to express the highly synergistic combination of the co-stimulatory protein CD80 and the IL-15/IL-15-receptor alpha (IL-15R) heterodimer. Prior proof-of-concept (POC) studies demonstrated eradication of disease in &gt;80% of leukemic mice with serial administration of TLV. In the current studies, TLV was generated from 59/60 cryopreserved, diagnostic bone marrow-derived patient AML samples. Ex vivo priming of post-remission patient T-cells by ex vivo co-culture with autologous TLV stimulated robust proliferative and cytotoxic responses. In secondary co-cultures, T-cells previously primed by initial co-culture with TLV, showed greater clonal expansion and leukemia-specific cytolytic activity towards de novo autologous AML blasts than did control, unprimed T-cells. The enhanced anti-leukemic activity of TLV-primed T-cells against de novo AML confirms the potential for vaccine administration to effectively target minimal residual disease (MRD) persisting after chemotherapy and reduce relapse.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Applications of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology in vaccine development.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yadollah Bahrami, Mansoor Bolideei, +5 authors, Mohammad Javad Mehran</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Vaccines have long been crucial in safeguarding public health by preventing and controlling infectious diseases. However, traditional vaccine development methods face challenges in efficiency, cost, and response time to emerging pathogens. Recent progress in art AI and nanotechnology is revolutionizing this landscape, offering innovative solutions for vaccine design, delivery, and optimization. This manuscript examines the transformative impact of AI and nanotechnology on advancing vaccine development, highlighting their synergistic effect in overcoming traditional limitations. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, facilitates rapid identification of immunogenic antigens and epitopes by analyzing vast genomic, proteomic, and immunological datasets. These computational tools optimize vaccine design by predicting antigen stability, immunogenicity, and efficacy, as exemplified by the expedited development of COVID-19 vaccines. Nanotechnology complements these advancements by providing engineered nanoparticles (NPs), including liposomes, polymeric NPs, and biomimetic systems, that enhance antigen delivery, stability, and immune activation. Innovations such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) further enhance vaccine safety and efficacy by mimicking natural infection processes to trigger robust, targeted immune responses. Integrating AI and nanotechnology presents remarkable opportunities for developing personalized immunization strategies. AI algorithms can assess individual immune profiles to design customized vaccines, while nanotechnology enables precise delivery and controlled release of antigens. This interdisciplinary approach accelerates vaccine development, ensuring both safety and efficacy, and lays the foundation for universal vaccines and cancer vaccines that target complex pathogens and non-infectious diseases. Together, AI and nanotechnology herald a new era in vaccinology, enabling the development of vaccines that are faster, more precise, and highly adaptable to emerging and complex health challenges.</p>
