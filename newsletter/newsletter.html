<h2 class="paper-title">Modelling multicellular coordination by bridging cell-cell communication and intracellular regulation through multilayer networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Trimbour, R., Ramirez Flores, R. O., +1 author, Cantini, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In multicellular organisms, cells with various roles and locations coordinate to provide systemic and cohesive response to perturbations. These complex behaviors emerge from a complex interplay between intracellular regulation and intercellular signals that mediate cell-cell communication. While single-cell technologies opened the possibility of studying both, most methods focus solely on one of these aspects. Thus, they are only able to partially recover in vivo and multicellular behaviors. We here introduce ReCoN (REconstruction of multicellular COordination Networks from single-cell data), a framework combining intracellular gene regulation and cell-cell communication to provide insights into multicellular coordination from single-cell data. First, ReCoN infers from single-cell data a heterogeneous multilayer network containing both cell-type-specific intracellular subnetworks and ligand-receptor interactions. Through random walk with restart explorations, ReCoN then infers the response of each cell type to both intra- and extracellular perturbations, such as a gene knock-out or a cytokine, respectively. ReCoN was evaluated on predicting the in vivo response of immune cell-types to different cytokines and on recovering cardiac cell-type response in heart failure. It highlighted the role of indirect effects, where cells emit secondary messengers in response to the initial perturbation to coordinate multicellular transcriptomic responses. Additionally, ReCoN predicted distinct fibroblast states emerging in different microenvironments reconstructed from spatial data. ReCoN provides an interpretable modeling framework for multicellular systems that allows for the simulation of perturbations, including the assessment of the cellular selectivity of these treatments in vivo. Ultimately, it can help design patient-specific molecular therapies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ultra-Content Screening (UCS): Toward the Big Blood Picture</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kloubert, S. B., Renders, S., +3 authors, Willbold, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present Ultra-Content Screening (UCS), a novel, scalable method combining cyclic immunostaining with high-dimensional image-based single-cell proteomics. UCS utilizes fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies and iterative staining-photobleaching cycles to analyze up to 40 markers in up to 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells per experiment. Through precise image registration, nuclear segmentation, signal harmonization, and normalization, UCS ensures the robust tracking of individual cells across all staining cycles. Data analysis via SPADE trees allows qualitative evaluation of expression patterns and cellular phenotypes. Application to samples from acute myeloid leukemia patients demonstrates UCS potential to uncover disease-specific expression profiles and immune subpopulations. The method provides unprecedented depth in single-cell proteomic analysis of blood samples, offering valuable insights for diagnostics, personalized medicine, and therapeutic approaches.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PCPpred: Prediction of Chemically Modified Peptide Permeability Across Multiple Assays for Oral Delivery</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shendre, A., Gahlot, P. S., Raghava, G. P. S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemically modified peptides, including cyclic peptides, have emerged as promising candidates for oral delivery yet they face the challenge of low membrane permeability. In this study, the datasets were sourced from CycPeptMPDB, a database for membrane permeability of peptides obtained from different assays. Our quantitative analysis showed a clear discordance between permeability measured using PAMPA and cell-based assays (Caco-2, MDCK, and, RRCK), thereby explaining its limits as surrogate for cell-based assays. Therefore, we developed assay-specific predictive models to more accurately capture permeability determinants in each system. We systematically compute diverse features of modified peptides using open-source software and used fine-tuned peptide embeddings generated using pretrained chemical language models. Baseline models were developed using the generated multi-hierarchical molecular features. We also developed a stacked ensemble architecture, which utilizes multi-hierarchical features in models as base learners. The ensemble model achieved the best PAMPA test set performance with an MSE of 0.200, R2 of 0.685, and PCC of 0.830; and a R2 of 0.783 on Caco-2 test set. Model trained on 2D Mordred descriptors attained the highest performance on the Caco-2 test-set with MSE of 0.129, R2 of 0.793, and PCC of 0.892, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches such as CPMP. To support widespread adoption, we developed an open-access web-server (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pcppred/) for users to design modified peptides using human comprehensible MAP (Modifications and Annotations of Proteins) format, converting MAP to SMILES format, and predict permeability across assays with result visualization. To ensure widespread adoption, and reproducibility, we also provided a standalone on GitHub (https://github.com/raghavagps/pcppred).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SigDyn: single-cell mutational signature dynamics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Costa, S. B., Goncalves, J. P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Cancer is driven by mutations that confer tumor cells proliferation advantages but also vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential. Underlying tumor progression are mutational processes that imprint signatures of co-occurring mutation types in tumor cell genomes. The discovery of signatures and their etiologies offers insight into disease mechanisms and treatment opportunities, however acquisition of mutations by tumor cells over time leads to intratumor heterogeneity that may challenge treatment efficacy. Understanding which mutational processes contribute to the evolution of each tumor can reveal therapeutic strategies, but it requires single-cell mutational signature analysis, which remains unexplored. Results: We present SigDyn, a framework enabling analysis of tumor mutational signature dynamics at single-cell resolution. To do this, SigDyn combines variant detection, tumor phylogeny inference, and signature identification. We applied SigDyn to scRNA-seq of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Inferred phylogenies recapitulated tumor markers and progression from normal tissue to tumor metastasis. Tumor-specific processes beyond aging, like cellular disruptions or patient treatments, were only exposed at single-cell level reinforcing the importance of granularity. For IDC, prominence of signature SBS26 with tumor evolution pointed to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, supported by downregulation of MMR genes. For LSCC, metastasis enrichment with SBS32-active cells and immune markers suggested influence of immunosuppressant treatment azathioprine, linked to increased risk of SCCs. The dynamics uncovered by SigDyn confirm its potential as a tool to investigate mechanisms of tumor evolution and heterogeneity. Availability: github.com/joanagoncalveslab/sigdyn.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ARID-sf: A physics-informed Deep Learning scoring function to improve Antibody-Antigen docking model ranking</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Grandguillaume, I., Barroso da Silva, F. L., Etchebest, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complexation is crucial for understanding immune responses, diagnostics, and the development of therapeutic antibodies. While molecular docking generates conformations, current scoring functions struggle to identify near-native poses, particularly for Ab-Ag interactions. We present ARID-sf (Antibody-antigen Residue Interface Docking scoring function), which combines classical force field potentials with structural features and protein language model embeddings through a self-attention-based neural network architecture. ARID-sf was trained on &gt;1.5 million docking models and evaluated across four independent test sets comprising 806 cases and 700,000+ docking models. ARID-sf consistently outperforms other functions on increasingly challenging docking scenarios. Critically, ARID-sf maintains performance across diverse sequence identities and increasing conformational change required to reach the bound state, starting with unbound components, demonstrating robust generalization. ARID-sf is parallelizable and can process thousands of docking models per minute, enabling practical application in computational Ab engineering pipelines. The code, trained network, and complete pipeline are freely available at https://github.com/DSIMB/ARID-sf.git.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine-learning-driven prediction and design of intrinsic transcription terminators</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kundlatsch, G. E., Neto, A. P. d. S., de Paiva, G. B., +2 authors, Pedrolli, D. B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intrinsic transcription terminators are biological parts critical for controlling gene expression in natural genomes and are fundamental to the modularity and predictability of synthetic gene circuits. Despite their simplicity of structure and function, we have not yet been able to rationally engineer synthetic terminators with a pre-defined strength, nor to accurately predict their strength from sequence. Here, we leveraged a curated library of bacterial terminators to train a data-driven predictive model, and, building on this surrogate, developed open-source software tools for predicting terminator performance and designing new intrinsic terminator sequences. Model interpretability analysis indicates that U-tract features emphasize a distal region longer than previously anticipated and that the initial hairpin GC content influence extends beyond the reported range. Using the final trained model, we implemented two software tools. The Terminator Strength Predictor (TerSP) computes the full feature representation directly from an input sequence and outputs a quantitative strength prediction together with a binary strong/weak classification. We validated TerSP using experimentally characterized terminators from bacteria other than E. coli. The Terminator Factory (TerFac) implements a surrogate-based optimization framework for target-driven terminator design under user-defined strength and length constraints. Using TerFac, we enumerated length-specific sets of maximally strong terminators, designed optimized synthetic terminators, and optimized a wild-type terminator. The designed terminators were validated in vivo in E. coli and in vitro, using a newly developed assay based on fluorescent RNA aptamers. The TerFac-designed terminators showed the expected strength, and the strongest one outperformed the best reference terminator in the training dataset, both in vivo and in vitro. These results indicate that the model captured sequence-to-function rules that are informative both for forward prediction (TerSP) and for the design of terminators with defined strength (TerFac).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">AMPBAN: A Deep Learning Framework Integrating Protein Sequence and Structural Features for Antimicrobial Peptide Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bai, W., Yang, W., +3 authors, Wang, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The escalating crisis of antimicrobial resistance poses a devastating and immediate threat to human life. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising antibiotic substitute to combat antimicrobial resistance. Compared with the traditional wet-lab screening approaches, computational models have largely improved the efficiency of predicting antimicrobial peptide. However, most computational models overlook or underutilize the evolution and structural information of peptides, which is crucial for understanding the peptide functions. Here, we proposed a sophisticated deep learning model to predict AMPs, Antimicrobial Peptide Bilinear Attention Network (AMPBAN), which incorporates peptide evolution features from ESM3 protein language model, structure features from ESMFold predicted with equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), and the joint information from sequence and structure learned via Bilinear Attention Network. AMPBAN consistently demonstrated superior accuracy and generalization compared to nine state-of-the-art AMP prediction models across multiple independent benchmarks. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms that our multimodal fusion strategy significantly refines the integration of sequence and structural signals, yielding superior predictive balance over single-modality models. This framework provides a robust tool for the accelerated discovery of novel AMPs and the advancement of next-generation antimicrobial drug development. The datasets, source code and models are available at https://github.com/baiwenhuim/ampban.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EpiTADformer: A Transformer-Based Model for High-Resolution TAD Boundary Detection Using Epigenomic Signal Embeddings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nguyen, M., Tang, S., +2 authors, Dozmorov, M. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human genome is partitioned at different levels of 3D genome organization, with topologically associating domains (TADs) being among the most well-known and biologically important structures. TAD boundary disruption is associated with a wide range of diseases such as cancer, neurological and developmental disorders. Numerous methods have been developed to detect TAD boundaries from chromatin contact maps obtained with Hi-C technology. However, these methods are largely limited by the resolution of Hi-C data, typically 1 Kb to 100 Kb. In contrast, functional DNA loci, collectively referred to as epigenomic data, are profiled at a much higher resolution (100-200 bp for a typical ChIP-seq experiment). To improve the resolution of boundary detection, we hypothesize that the patterns of epigenomic signals associated with regions in proximity to TAD boundaries can serve as embeddings for these genomic regions, defining region similarity. These embeddings, along with their positional relationships, can be effectively modeled using deep learning to achieve more precise boundary prediction. We present EpiTADformer, a transformer-based model that takes as input transcriptional and histone modification signals of neighboring regions centered around TAD boundaries. We demonstrate that EpiTADformer outperforms feedforward neural network, convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network architectures. These results suggest the positional information of epigenomic signals surrounding TAD boundaries provides a strong predictive signal, enabling improved performance of the transformer model. Our findings highlight the potential of epigenomic signals to serve as region embeddings for refining the epigenomic language of TAD domains and 3D genome organization.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ButterflyVI: enabling high-throughput variant interpretation and biomarker discovery with functional genomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sesia, D., Hatos, A., +1 author, Ciriello, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Characterizing the functional and therapeutic relevance of cancer mutations is a primary goal and a major challenge in precision oncology. Whereas predictive approaches exist, they often lack functional validation, which cannot scale to large numbers of cancer-associated variants. Here, we integrated statistical learning with experimental evidence from high-throughput functional screenings to annotate &gt;20000 unique variants. We defined a variant as functional if it altered the effect of gene loss, and classified four possible outcomes: oncogene and tumor suppressor dependencies, mutation tolerance, and bypass-of-essentiality. Up-to-60% of variants annotated as functional were previously considered of unknown significance. Paradoxically, bypass-of-essentiality was common among loss-of- function (LoF) variants at several tumor suppressors, including VHL, ARID1A, and RBM10. In these cases, loss of the wild-type genes was deleterious, independently of the tissue of origin, but not when they already harbored recurrent LoF variants, suggesting loss of these tumor suppressors provides a context-specific advantage. Using our annotations, we discovered somatic variants that increased sensitivity to loss of therapeutically targetable genes, representing new candidate biomarkers. Among these, we validated RPL5 LoF mutations as a biomarker of response to selective MDM2 inhibitors. A dedicated web portal (butterflyvi.unil.ch) enables exploration of all variant annotations and candidate biomarkers. This study highlights the potential and need to expand large-scale functional screenings to empower variant interpretation in the clinic.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clinical proteomics has the potential to add a valuable data layer to genomic and histopathological analyses in precision oncology, but its application to limited clinical material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables in-depth proteomic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), including small biopsies and single tissue sections mounted on glass slides. Despite minimal input material, single-slide analyses of clinical lung tumor specimens yielded biologically and clinically informative data, supporting detection of actionable proteins, immune-related signatures, and multivariate biomarkers. These results establish the feasibility of proteomics for retrospective FFPE studies and routine clinical practice, expanding opportunities for biomarker discovery and precision medicine from scarce tissue material.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">IL-1α drives a tumor-stroma-neutrophil axis through inflammatory fibroblast activation in head and neck cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hanschmann, E.-M., Bruderek, K., +15 authors, Brandau, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) density is a robust biomarker of poor prognosis. TANs predominantly localize to the stroma and their intratumoral density strongly correlates with adverse outcome. Here, we investigated how tumor-stroma communication regulates TAN recruitment, activation, and spatial organization. We identified interleukin-1 (IL-1), released by viable or necrotic tumor cells, as an upstream signal that induces an inflammatory cancer associated fibroblast (iCAF)-like transcriptional program in patient-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of the oral cavity. IL-1-stimulated MSCs secrete factors associated with neutrophil recruitment, survival, and function, together with mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Notably, the IL-1-induced iCAF-like transcriptional program closely resembles CAF subsets in HNSCC that are associated with poor clinical outcome. Functionally, conditioned media from IL-1-stimulated MSCs promoted tumor growth and enhanced polymorphonuclear neutrophil survival, activation, trans-well migration and infiltration into spheroids, in vitro. In zebrafish xenografts, co-injection of IL-1-overexpressing tumor cells and MSCs markedly amplified neutrophil infiltration. TCGA analysis demonstrated robust correlations between the IL-1-induced MSC gene signature and neutrophil signatures across multiple TAN subsets in human HNSCC. Spatial analysis of HNSCC tissues showed that stromal regions adjacent to IL1A-positive tumor islets were enriched for CXCL8/CSF3 double-positive cells and exhibited increased TAN density, including higher frequencies of NE- and MPO-positive neutrophils. Collectively, these findings define an IL-1-dependent tumor-stroma signaling circuit that links tumor inflammation to stromal remodeling and neutrophil infiltration in HNSCC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Protein buffering of aneuploidy is driven by coordinated factors identified through machine learning.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Erik Marcel Heller, Karen Barthel, +3 authors, Zuzana Storchová</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer, alters chromosome copy numbers and with that the abundance of hundreds of proteins. Evidence suggests that levels of proteins encoded on affected chromosomes are often buffered toward their abundances observed in diploids. Despite its prevalence, the molecular mechanisms driving this protein dosage compensation remain largely unknown. It is unclear whether all proteins are buffered similarly, what factors determine buffering, and whether dosage compensation varies across different cell lines or tumor types. Moreover, its potential adaptive advantage and therapeutic relevance remain unexplored. We established a novel approach to quantify protein dosage buffering in a gene copy number-dependent manner, showing that dosage compensation is widespread but variable in cancer samples. By developing multifactorial machine learning models, we identify gene dependency, protein complex participation, haploinsufficiency, and mRNA decay as key predictors of buffering. We show that dosage compensation affects oncogenic potential and that higher buffering correlates with reduced proteotoxic stress and increased drug resistance. These findings highlight protein dosage compensation as a crucial regulatory mechanism with therapeutic potential in aneuploid cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">RaMBat: Accurate identification of medulloblastoma subtypes from diverse data sources with severe batch effects.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mengtao Sun, Jieqiong Wang, Shibiao Wan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As the most common pediatric brain malignancy, medulloblastoma (MB) includes multiple distinct molecular subtypes characterized by clinical heterogeneity and genetic alterations. Accurate identification of MB subtypes is essential for downstream risk stratification and tailored therapeutic design. Existing MB subtyping approaches perform poorly due to limited cohorts and severe batch effects when integrating various MB data sources. To address these concerns, we propose a novel approach called RaMBat for accurate MB subtyping from diverse data sources with severe batch effects. Benchmarking tests based on 13 datasets with severe batch effects suggested that RaMBat achieved a median accuracy of 99%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art MB subtyping approaches and conventional machine learning classifiers. RaMBat could efficiently deal with the batch effects and clearly separate subtypes of MB samples from diverse data sources. We believe RaMBat will bring direct positive impacts on downstream MB risk stratification and tailored treatment design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Advances in MS-based glycomics for biomedical research.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Joy Solomon, Akeem Sanni, +6 authors, Yehia Mechref</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glycosylation is a highly complex and functionally diverse post-translational modification that modulates protein folding, stability, cell signaling, and immune response. Aberrant glycosylation is associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infections, making glycans attractive targets for biomarker discovery and therapeutic development. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a widely used analytical tool, for glycomics analysis due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and structural resolution. This review highlights advances in MS-based glycomics, encompassing sample preparation, ionization techniques, and fragmentation strategies. Quantitative strategies, including stable isotope labeling, isobaric tagging, and label-free approaches, are also examined for their roles in precise glycan quantification. The review also explores bioinformatics tools and the growing integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning for glycan structure prediction and data interpretation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Radiological and biological dictionary of radiomics features: addressing understandable AI issues in personalized breast cancer; dictionary version BM1.0.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gorji A, Sanati N, +4 authors, Salmanpour MR.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective.Radiomics-based artificial intelligence (AI) models show potential in breast cancer diagnosis but lack interpretability. This study bridges the gap between radiomic features (RFs) and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors through a clinically interpretable framework.Methods. We developed a dual-dictionary approach. First, a clinical mapping dictionary (CMD) was constructed by mapping 56 RFs to BI-RADS descriptors (shape, margin, internal enhancement (IE)) based on literature and expert review. Second, we applied this framework to a classification task to predict triple-negative (TNBC) versus non-TNBC subtypes using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data from a multi-institutional cohort of 1549 patients. We trained 27 machine learning classifiers with 27 feature selection methods. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we interpreted the model's predictions and developed a Statistical Mapping Dictionary for 51 RFs, not included in the CMD.Results. The best-performing model (variance inflation factor feature selector + extra trees classifier) achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.02. Our dual-dictionary approach successfully translated predictive RFs into understandable clinical concepts. For example, higher values of 'Sphericity', corresponding to a round/oval shape, were predictive of TNBC. Similarly, lower values of 'Busyness', indicating more homogeneous IE, were also associated with TNBC, aligning with existing clinical observations. This framework confirmed known imaging biomarkers and identified novel, data-driven quantitative features.Conclusion.This study introduces a novel dual-dictionary framework (BM1.0) that bridges RFs and the BI-RADS clinical lexicon. By enhancing the interpretability and transparency of AI models, the framework supports greater clinical trust and paves the way for integrating RFs into breast cancer diagnosis and personalized care.</p>
