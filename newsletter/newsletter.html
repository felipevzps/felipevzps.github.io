<h2 class="paper-title">AI-driven multi-omics integration in precision oncology: bridging the data deluge to clinical decisions.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chou-Yi Hsu, Shavan Askar, +5 authors, Hamed Soleimani Samarkhazan</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer's staggering molecular heterogeneity demands innovative approaches beyond traditional single-omics methods. The integration of multi-omics data, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and radiomics, can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when accompanied by rigorous preprocessing and external validation; for example, recent integrated classifiers report AUCs around 0.81-0.87 for difficult early-detection tasks. This review synthesizes how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning and machine learning, bridges this gap by enabling scalable, non-linear integration of disparate omics layers into clinically actionable insights. We explore cutting-edge AI methodologies, including graph neural networks for biological network modeling, transformers for cross-modal fusion, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparent clinical decision support. Critical applications are highlighted, such as AI-driven therapy selection (e.g., predicting targeted therapy resistance), proteogenomic early detection, and radiogenomic non-invasive diagnostics. We further address translational challenges: data harmonization, batch correction, missing data imputation, and computational scalability. Emerging trends, federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, spatial/single-cell omics for microenvironment decoding, quantum computing, and patient-centric "N-of-1" models, signal a paradigm shift toward dynamic, personalized cancer management. Despite persistent hurdles in model generalizability, ethical equity, and regulatory alignment, AI-powered multi-omics integration promises to transform precision oncology from reactive population-based approaches to proactive, individualized care.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">STAMPS: Signal-peptide Transformer for Augmenting Mammalian Protein Secretion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gabrielli, J., Esposito, M., +4 authors, Ceroni, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While secretion plays a key role in the diverse applications of cell engineering, to date only a handful of mammalian signal peptides have been characterised in depth and systematic efforts to build novel variants remain sporadic. We present STAMPS (Signal peptide Transformer for Augmenting Mammalian Protein Secretion), a generative, autoregressive transformer fine-tuned on ~6,000 mammalian signal peptides to design de novo sequences that modulate and enhance secretion across proteins and hosts. We show that STAMPS can be used to identify candidate signal peptides that outperform the widely used IgG {kappa} light-chain leader (IgKL) when used to secrete EGFP in HEK293T and CHO cells, and hEPO in HEK293T cells. When incorporated in an industrial cell line development framework, STAMPS leads to the generation of signal peptides that yield ~2.3-fold gain in secretion of a VHH-Fc compared to the internal industrial benchmark in CHO G22 cells, with the same candidates ranking highly in both CHO and HEK293T hosts. Sequence-to-function analysis highlights a longer, strongly hydrophobic core and a tightly positioned cleavage site as drivers of this strong performance. Together, these results establish data-driven, generative design of mammalian signal peptides as a practical route to tune and improve secretion for bioproduction and cell engineering applications.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inferring and Evaluating Network Medicine-Based Disease Modules with Nextflow</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kersting, J., Spindler, L. M., +12 authors, List, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Most human diseases result from complex molecular interactions of genes and proteins. Various network-based computational methods characterize these mechanisms by expanding seed genes into disease-associated subnetworks, or disease modules. Evaluating these diverse methods is tedious due to unique installation and data preparation requirements. Moreover, the underlying algorithmic strategies differ, making it difficult to determine which of the created modules are most useful or biologically plausible. To address this challenge, we developed an all-in-one Nextflow pipeline that enables automated and reproducible analyses. It handles installation, input preparation, execution, and systematic evaluation of six widely used module detection tools, considering module topology, functional coherence, robustness, and the capacity to recover seeds. In addition, it annotates the resulting disease modules with biological context information, prioritizes potential drug candidates, and generates visualizations and a comprehensive summary report. To showcase the value of our pipeline and offer guidance to potential users, we performed a comprehensive evaluation across 50 different disease-network combinations, revealing substantial variability among the derived disease modules. We show that this variability is driven by differences in modeling approach, input network, and seed composition. While most methods are robust to minor perturbations, they struggle to recover omitted seeds, and none consistently outperforms others, underscoring the need for careful method selection. Our work enables the research community to systematically compare approaches for disease module discovery, promoting reproducible network medicine research. Integrated into the nf-core project (https://nf-co.re/diseasemodulediscovery), it is intended as an extendable, long-term resource for tracking progress in the field.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Analyzing the Performance of Deep Learning Splice Prediction Algorithms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fortier, N., Rudy, G., Scherer, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> SpliceAI has become the leading computational tool for predicting splice-altering variants, but restrictive licensing has limited its adoption by commercial clinical laboratories. While open-source reimplementations have emerged with author-reported comparisons, independent benchmarking across diverse datasets is needed to establish their practical equivalence. We compared the original SpliceAI algorithm against two open-source alternatives (OpenSpliceAI and CI-SpliceAI) across three independent benchmarks: a curated dataset of 1,316 functionally validated variants, 213 variants with experimental splice assay data, and 58,064 clinically classified variants from ClinVar. All deep-learning methods were also compared with a legacy ensemble of four traditional splice prediction algorithms (MaxEntScan, NNSplice, GeneSplicer, and PWM), enabling direct comparison between modern and conventional approaches. Across all benchmarks, the deep-learning models consistently outperformed the ensemble of traditional algorithms. We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy for each algorithm, and performed statistical testing to assess significance of performance differences. Additionally, we conducted a correlation analysis on 100,000 variants to quantify the concordance of splice-scores and the agreement on splice site positions between implementations. All three deep learning algorithms demonstrated comparable performance on the literature-curated benchmark (balanced accuracies: 89.5-90.7%) and the ClinVar dataset (88.9-89.5%). While both open-source solutions achieved a statistically significantly higher accuracy than SpliceAI on the ClinVar dataset, the magnitude of this improvement was small and unlikely to be of practical significance. On the functional splice assay dataset, the original SpliceAI achieved the highest accuracy (83.6%), while OpenSpliceAI showed significantly lower performance (74.6%, p = 0.019). Correlation analysis revealed that CI-SpliceAI maintained balanced concordance across splice event types ({rho} = 0.786-0.883), whereas OpenSpliceAI exhibited asymmetric performance with stronger correlation for loss events ({rho} = 0.924-0.940) than gain events ({rho} = 0.668-0.677). Both implementations demonstrated high spatial agreement with SpliceAI, with exact splice site position match rates exceeding 90% for all event types. Together, these results demonstrate that both open-source reimplementations of SpliceAI successfully reproduce the predictive behavior of the original algorithm across multiple evaluation contexts, while consistently outperforming traditional splice prediction methods.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A frameshift mutation in the methyltransferase rlmN is associated with increased linezolid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Reimer, B. M., Green, A. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Linezolid is a key component of treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Resistance to linezolid in MTB has traditionally been attributed to mutations in the 23S rRNA (rrl) and ribosomal protein L3 (rplC), but only a fraction of clinically observed linezolid resistance is explained by mutations in these two genes. We report that an analysis of strains with paired whole-genome sequencing and linezolid minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) phenotyping from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) reveals that a relatively common frameshift mutation in MTB methyltransferase rlmN (5.3% of assessed isolates) is significantly associated with increased linezolid MIC. In additional to statistical associations, we provide evolutionary evidence of homology to an established linezolid resistance mechanism in Staphylococcus aureus, and structural evidence that the frameshift mutation likely ablates rlmN methyltransferase functionality.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Pandia, B., Regati, D., +3 authors, Chandra, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cutibacterium acnes is a predominant member of the human skin microbiome, generally as a beneficial or a benign inhabitant, which under specific conditions transforms into a pathogen, causing acne and associated inflammatory responses. While there is a wealth of data on the microbiology and genomics of the microbe, there is a lack of comprehensive annotation of the proteins coded by the genome, slowing progress in understanding its unique metabolic versatility and survival in host hypoxic sebaceous niches. We configured an integrated pipeline for functional annotation of the C. acnes genome, combining gene calling, domain and ontology mapping, KEGG pathways assignment, proteome-scale structural modeling, predicting Pockets and associating the small-molecule metabolites based on binding site similarity to facilitate structure-to-function annotation. Structural predictions using ColabFold covered nearly the full proteome, with 67.4% of models showing high confidence. To infer protein function, ligand-binding sites in the C. acnes modeled proteome were predicted using a consensus of three independent algorithms, PocketDepth, SiteHound, and FPocket. The resulting pockets were matched with known small-molecule binding sites in PDB to map potential ligands, resulting in the C. acnes predicted metabolome (CApM) comprising 1,954 ligands across 1,865 proteins. CAcnesDB is a comprehensive up-to-date database of the C. acnes genome, hosting functional annotation from multiple levels of input and analyses, covering 2297 protein-coding genes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Generating Hybrid Proteins with the MSA-Transformer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tule, S., Davis, S., +2 authors, Boden, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein superfamilies display extensive sequence and functional divergence, providing a rich landscape for engineering hybrid or functionally enhanced proteins.ergence, providing a rich landscape for engineering hybrid or functionally enhanced proteins. We present a stochastic, iterative framework that leverages the MSA-Transformer to generate intermediate sequences that define a pathway between a user-defined homologous 'source' and 'target' protein in sequence space. Targeted site selection for masking is guided either by embedding-based dissimilarity or by row-attention information, while beam search concurrently explores multiple mutational pathways. Pretrained sparse autoencoders combined with sequence and structural analyses are used to trace the inheritance and exchange of features across the mutational pathways, revealing hybrid sequences that integrate properties of both source and target proteins. Applied across diverse protein families, the framework produces sequences that occupy biologically meaningful regions of sequence space and achieve higher consistency and plausibility scores than random baselines according to in-silico metrics. In the B1/B2 metallo-beta-lactamase family, the generated hybrids largely retain their core fold recombining structural and active-site motifs from both subclasses, demonstrating the model's capacity to preserve catalytic features while exploring novel structural permutations. Code availability: The implementation is available via GitHub at https://github.com/santule/protmixy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Global Discovery of Antimicrobial Peptides in Deep-Sea Microbiomes Driven by an ESM-2 and Transformer-based Dual-Engine Framework</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, B., Mou, X., +3 authors, Li, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The escalating global threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens underscores the urgent demand for innovative strategies in antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery. Notably, deep-sea-related data resources remain underexplored, despite their potential as valuable sources of novel AMPs. Current AMP prediction methods, however, are limited by dataset biases such as sequence length imbalance between AMPs and non-AMPs, N-terminal methionine artifacts in non-AMPs, and microbial origin specificity. To overcome these constraints, we developed a dual-engine predictor named XAMP, which integrates two complementary architectures: XAMP-E, built on ESM-2 for high-accuracy feature representation, and XAMP-T, built on one-layer Transformer for accelerating large-scale screening. This dual-engine design ensures both robust feature learning and enhanced generalization capability. By constructing length-balanced datasets, removing N-terminal methionine from non-AMPs, and training microbial-specific variants, XAMP achieved a median area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.972, representing an approximately 10% improvement over state-of-the-art predictors. Using an integrated AMP mining pipeline incorporating these models, we screened large-scale deep-sea metagenomic data and identified 2,355 promising AMP candidates. This study establishes a robust deep-learning framework that facilitates targeted discovery of bioactive peptides from extremophile microbiomes through systematic multi-omics validation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">IRCAS: a novel end-to-end approach to identify, rectify and classify comprehensive alternative splicing events in a transcriptome without genome reference</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shen, C., Zhang, Q., +4 authors, Zhang, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental post-transcriptional mechanism that amplifies proteomic diversity and enables adaptive responses across eukaryotes. Current AS detection methods rely heavily on reference genomes, limiting their applicability to non-model organisms. Existing reference-free approaches suffer from inaccurate splice site prediction and treat detection and classification as separate processes, resulting in cascading errors. We present IRCAS, an integrated end-to-end framework for reference-free AS analysis, comprising three modules: identification, rectification, and classification. IRCAS employs colored de Bruijn graphs for AS detection, an attention-based CNN for splice site rectification, and a hybrid Graph Neural Network combining GAT and Transformer layers for classification. Evaluation across four species demonstrates substantial improvements: splice site accuracy increased to 92-96% versus 50-55% for existing methods, and end-to-end accuracy reached 83.4% compared to 41.2% for the previous best method. IRCAS establishes a new benchmark for reference-free AS detection in non-model organisms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA language models (DNA-LMs) are transforming how genomic sequence information is represented and interpreted. Yet most current approaches treat DNA as a single sequence, overlooking the diploid structure and zygosity information that distinguish the two parental copies of the genome. Here, we systematically evaluate explicit diploid, zygosity-aware representations in DNA-LMs for two downstream tasks: ancestry classification and gene expression prediction. For ancestry, we use HyenaDNA embeddings of the extended MHC region and show that concatenating maternal and paternal haplotype embeddings consistently improves predictive performance across five superpopulations compared to single-haplotype inputs. For gene expression, we compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained from scratch with Nucleotide Transformer models using reference-only, single-copy, and two-copy (zygosity-aware) sequence encodings. CNNs showed increased performance by incorporating genetic variation and zygosity via simple additive genotype encoding, whereas naively injecting variation into pretrained Nucleotide Transformer models yields mixed effects, highlighting a mismatch between current pretraining objectives and variation-sensitive prediction. Together, our results demonstrate that zygosity-aware representations can capture biologically meaningful information beyond reference-only views and underscore the need for diploid- and population-aware pretraining strategies in future DNA-LMs for variant interpretation and precision medicine.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Hidden-driver inference reveals synergistic brain-penetrant therapies for medulloblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, J., Yang, X., +16 authors, Yu, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Effective therapies for high-risk medulloblastoma (MB), particularly MYC-driven Group 3 (G3) MB, remain elusive due to limited druggable mutations, poor blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and rapid resistance. We developed SINBA (Synergy Inference by Data-driven Network-Based Bayesian Analysis), a systems biology framework that predicts synergistic, BBB-permeable drug combinations by identifying hidden drivers that sustain oncogenic programs without detectable genetic or transcriptional alterations. Integrating MB specific gene networks, transcriptomic data, and drug gene interactions, SINBA prioritized 32 candidate combinations, of which 19 were experimentally validated as synergistic. The MEK inhibitor mirdametinib and p38 inhibitor regorafenib emerged as the top brain-penetrant pair, suppressing G3 MB progression and extending survival in human xenograft and immunocompetent mouse models, with efficacy enhanced by low-dose radiation. Single cell analysis revealed selective targeting of the developmental origins of G3 MB, accompanied by immune microenvironment reprogramming. These findings establish hidden-driver inference as a generalizable framework for rational drug combination discovery.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">E3 ubiquitin-ligase Hakai induces LRP4 degradation and regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in colorectal cancer cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rodriguez-Alonso, A., Jove, L., +4 authors, Figueroa, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely linked to the acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, which contribute to treatment resistance and metastasis. This study investigates the role of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase Hakai, the first identified post-translational regulator of E-cadherin stability, in promoting CSC traits in colorectal cancer (CRC). To examine Hakai's involvement in CSC regulation, we used an inducible shRNA in a HT29 cells. Under conditions that promote CSC characteristics, we silenced Hakai and evaluated tumoursphere formation and CSC marker expression. Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify Hakai-regulated proteins in tumoursphere cultures. Additionally, Western blot, RT-qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and TOPFlash assays were employed to study CSC-related protein regulation in response to Hakai expression. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of Hakin-1, the pharmacological inhibitor specifically targeting Hakai's HYB domain responsible for its E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity, on tumoursphere properties. Hakai silencing significantly reduced tumoursphere size and number accompanied by decreased expression of CSC markers and Wnt target genes. CSC-related proteins regulated by Hakai were identified, including LRP4, a negative regulator of Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. Hakai interacts with LRP4, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, Hakai overexpression induces hyperactivation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin sand disrupts LRP4's inhibitory effect. Treatment with Hakin-1 effectively inhibited self-renewal and promoted differentiation within tumourspheres. These findings suggest that Hakai promotes CSCs properties by hyperactivation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway via LRP4-mediated modulation. Additionally, Hakin-1 emerges as a promising therapeutic agent targeting CSCs by enhancing differentiation and attenuating Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity, highlighting Hakai as a potential target for improving CSC treatment.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mevalonate pathway activation in Ewing sarcoma reveals a 3D-specific synergy between statins and BCL-xL inhibition</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Radic-Sarikas, B., Markovic, M., +8 authors, Kovar, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bone sarcomas are rare and aggressive pediatric cancers with limited progress in targeted therapy development, in part due to the poor physiological relevance of conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems used for preclinical testing. To address this gap, we developed a standardized three-dimensional (3D) culture and drug-testing platform for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma (OS) that more accurately recapitulates in vivo tumor biology. Across 3D spheroids, bioprinted constructs, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cultures, we observed a consistent activation and dependency on the mevalonate pathway in ES. Leveraging this platform, we identified a selective therapeutic synergy between statins, which inhibit mevalonate pathway flux, and BCL-xL inhibitors, a vulnerability that was not detectable in 2D cultures. These findings highlight the mevalonate pathway as a targetable metabolic dependency in ES and demonstrate how physiologically grounded 3D models can uncover clinically actionable treatment strategies that remain hidden in traditional 2D systems. Our findings show that 3D tumor models can expose actionable metabolic vulnerabilities obscured by traditional approaches, supporting their use in rational combination therapy discovery for aggressive pediatric sarcomas.</p>
