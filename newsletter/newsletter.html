<h2 class="paper-title">CellBin:a generalist framework to process spatial omics data to cell level</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Y., Liu, H., +17 authors, Li, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial omics has rapidly expanded with increasingly diverse imaging modalities,molecular targets,and chip sizes.However,no general framework currently exists to construct cell level matrices that are robust across platforms and omics types.Here we present CellBin,a universal and scalable framework that unifies image stitching,cell segmentation,and spot-to-cell mapping for multiple spatial omics technologies.CellBin integrates a multi-field weighted stitching algorithm for large-area images, a family of U-Net-based models trained across diverse staining modalities,and an optimized computational architecture for high-throughput processing.Across five technological platforms and three omics data types,CellBin achieves robust segmentation and accurate single-cell matrix construction,consistently outperforming seven state-of-the-art methods in F1-score, cell size precision, and annotation accuracy.By providing a generalizable,cross-platform solution,CellBin bridges multiple spatial omics,enabling unified, high-resolution cell level analyses across technologies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">High-throughput plasma proteomic platforms: Insights from a multi-ethnic Asian cohort</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bahai, A., Wang, H., +21 authors, Sadhu, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We compared three leading affinity-based and mass-spectrometry-based proteomic platforms (SomaScan11K, Olink Explore HT, Orbitrap Astral with Seer Proteograph [MS-Seer]) in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort, to inform biomarker discovery and functional genomic studies of global populations. We found limited overlap (1,740 proteins) across the three platforms, with modest correlations (0.34-0.10). SomaScan had lower missingness (&lt;1%) and CV (&lt;10%), compared to Olink (51%, 23%) and MS-Seer (12%, 19%). The new assays in Olink Explore HT (absent in Explore3072) primarily drove its higher missingness and CV. The number of phenotypic associations varied by trait, while the number of genetic associations (cis-pQTLs at P&lt;5e-08) were similar for Olink and SomaScan. Protein levels differed between ethnicities, with SomaScan identifying more ethnicity-differentiated proteins than Olink (FDR&lt;0.05). Finally, SomaScan ANML normalization attenuated biologically relevant associations in our study. These findings underscore the importance of platform evaluation and data normalization strategies for application in large-scale, diverse population cohorts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cell-cell communication analysis demonstrates early-stage common pathways linking ageing, Alzheimers disease, and Type 2 diabetes-related brain dysfunction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wei, B., Stitt, A., Little, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ageing promotes to the development of age related diseases and cognitive decline. In this study, we integrated and analysed four single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets encompassing Alzheimers disease, type 2 diabetes, and ageing in mouse brain tissue to identify early pathological factors that may drive normal ageing toward disease through alterations in cell to cell communication (CCC). Building on our previously established CCC change modelling framework, we found that both Alzheimers disease and ageing were characterized by a loss of intercellular communication, whereas type 2 diabetes exhibited an overall gain of new communication pathways. Notably, vascular communication changes were more prominent in age related diseases than in normal ageing. Furthermore, we identified a series of CCC molecules that play key roles in brain ageing and disease through pseudo covariance and conflicting resolving CCC algorithms. Among them, the LRP1 receptor on astrocytes emerged as a central CCC hub implicated in both ageing and disease pathology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NetFlow: A Framework to Explore Topological Representations of High-Dimensional Biomedical Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Elkin, R., Oh, J. H., +1 author, Deasy, J. O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomedical datasets are increasingly high-dimensional and multi-modal, theoretically enabling a more comprehensive understanding of biological systems. However, common clustering and dimensionality reduction methods often oversimplify continua and obscure complex, biologically relevant patterns, hindering our ability to meaningfully probe sample relationships. To address this challenge, we developed NetFlow, a computational framework that constructs graph representations of structural relationships between samples by integrating a data-driven, lineage-tracing-inspired pseudo-ordering with sparse similarity networks. NetFlow is suitable for small cohorts, features a flexible, modular design, supports multi-modal data fusion, and provides interactive visualization, enabling nuanced exploration of heterogeneity across biological samples. Applied across uni- and multi-modal cancer datasets, NetFlow refined clinically relevant subtypes, identified biomarker associations, and revealed more informative and structured relational patterns when benchmarked against current approaches. NetFlow thus delivers an interpretable graph representation of sample relatedness that supports precision oncology, hypothesis generation, and general high-dimensional data analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SARS-CoV-2 infection induced alterations in ADAR editing patterns differ between patients who developed critical compared to non-critical COVID-19</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nair, A. M., Piontkivska, H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations even among individuals with similar demographics. Disease severity has been linked with viral recognition- triggered expression of Interferons (IFNs) and Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Among these ISGs, ADARp150 is a member of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) enzyme family. ADARs are RNA editing enzymes that contribute to transcriptome diversity and modulate immune response during viral infections. While previous studies have identified altered ADAR expression and editing patterns during SARS-CoV-2 infection, it remains unknown whether ADAR expression and activity differ between patients with varying severities of COVID-19, specifically, in individuals who developed critical compared to non-critical COVID-19. We address this question by analyzing a publicly available, deeply sequenced whole blood RNA-seq dataset from individuals with either critical or non-critical COVID-19, matched for age, sex, and presence of comorbidities. Our results show differential expression of thousands of genes, including those involved in neutrophil degranulation, and upregulation of ADAR1 and its isoform ADARp110 in patients with critical COVID-19. We further identify global differences in the total number of edits, driven by ADAR1 and ADAR2 expression levels in critical but not in non-critical patients. ADAR activity also differed within Alu elements and in the proportion of edits with varying functional consequences. We further identified severity specific editing events, including nonsynonymous edits, within distinct biological pathways. Moreover, we identified 140 high confidence editing sites within 126 genes, that are differentially edited between the two patient groups. These genes were enriched in infectious disease, cell cycle, signal transduction, RNA and protein metabolism in addition to inflammatory pathways such as neutrophil degranulation and signaling by interleukins. Enrichment/modulation of neutrophil degranulation pathway at transcriptional and post transcriptional levels suggest the importance, complex regulation, and contribution of this pathway in COVID-19 disease severity. Finally, using a random forest classifier, we identified a set of differentially edited sites that could serve as molecular markers for COVID-19 disease severity. Together, our study demonstrates varying expression and editing patterns of ADARs between critical and non-critical patients, suggesting a potential role of ADAR editing in varying severity of COVID-19 pathogenesis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">HDCluster: High-Degree Graph Clustering for Robust Analysis of Single Molecule Localization Microscopy</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Khater, I. M., Nabi, I. R., Hamarneh, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis: grouping similar objects together into distinguishable subsets. Here, we introduce HDCluster, a novel high-degree graph-based clustering algorithm designed to effectively and rapidly handle various real-world clustering applications, particularly in the context of super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). HDCluster efficiently handles datasets with large and variable numbers of clusters, without requiring prior knowledge of the cluster count, relying on only one parameter. The high speed and efficiency of HDCluster allow it to handle large SMLM datasets with millions of localizations. A comprehensive quantitative comparison against state-of-the-art clustering methods using simulated, public, and real-world datasets demonstrates that HDCluster outperforms other clustering algorithms in terms of time efficiency and clustering performance measures, such as ARI and AMI. HDCluster is particularly robust to noise, making it a promising and effective tool for various clustering tasks in big-data settings, such as SMLM.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MetaboFM: A Foundation Model for Spatial Metabolomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ozturk, E., Moctezuma, F. G. R., Coskun, A. F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides molecularly resolved maps of metabolites and lipids across tissues, yet the lack of large scale, unified representation learning frameworks limits its potential for generalization and downstream analysis. Here, we introduce MetaboFM, a foundation model for spatial metabolomics that consolidates thousands of public MSI datasets into standardized spatial spectral tensors and extracts transferable embeddings using pretrained Vision Transformers. We curated and standardized around 4000 publicly available MSI datasets from the METASPACE repository, spanning multiple organisms, tissue types, ionization modes, and instruments. Across six metadata prediction tasks: encompassing organism, ionization polarity, tissue type, condition, analyzer type, and ionization source, embeddings from pretrained MetaboFM encoders achieved a mean macro F1 of 0.74 and accuracy of 0.80 with linear probes, demonstrating substantially higher discriminative power than classical principal component analysis (PCA) or randomly initialized baselines by over 20 percentage points. To interpret the learned representations, we mapped embedding directions back to the m/z domain, revealing distinct spectral regions that drive class separation across tissues, conditions, and ionization sources. A multimodal visual question answering (VQA) extension further links MSI embeddings with natural-language queries through a cross-attention fusion module, attaining an average macro F1 of 0.61 across tasks. Finally, an interactive Gradio interface enables users to visualize MSI patches and query sample metadata in free form language. Together, MetaboFM establishes a scalable foundation model paradigm for MSI, unifying representation learning, spectral interpretability, and multimodal interaction within a single framework for spatial metabolomics.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">FuFiHLA: A tool for Full-Field HLA typing from long read data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hu, J., Qin, Q., +1 author, Zhou, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation Allele typing for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes has many important clinical applications. Popular short-read typing can only accurately distinguish alleles at the peptide level, which potentially limit our understanding of the effect of variants in non-coding region. Recently, a few methods were declared to distinguish full-field HLA alleles from de-novo assemblies, which motivates us to develop an accurate HLA typing method directly from long reads. Results We developed FuFiHLA, a lightweight open-source software, to type HLA alleles. Currently it supports typing alleles of six HLA genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1) from long reads. Evaluation using 47 PacBio HiFi samples from HPRC shows that FuFiHLA achieves 99.57% accuracy in the full field allele typing and QV as 50.1 for consensus allele sequence construction. Additional testing on four Nanopore R10 reads demonstrates slightly reduced accuracy in the fourth field.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">M-DeepAssembly2: A Web Server for Predicting Multiple Conformations of Multi-domain Proteins Using Deep Learning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cui, X., Ge, L., +2 authors, Zhang, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The biological functions of proteins often depend on dynamic transitions between multiple conformational states, and for multi-domain proteins, inter-domain dynamics play a critical role in their biological functions. Despite significant advances in static structure prediction, accurately modeling these multiple conformations remains a major challenge. Here, we present M-DeepAssembly2, a web server designed for modeling multiple conformations of multi-domain proteins using deep learning-predicted inter-domain and intra-domain constraints. The server operates in three stages. Firstly, evolutionary, physicochemical, and geometric features are extracted from the input and fed into AlphaFlex, a flexible residue prediction network. This process generates multiple distance maps that effectively capture both inter-domain and intra-domain interactions. Secondly, supplementary distance maps that characterize inter-domain interactions are generated using the DeepAssembly method. Finally, all distance maps are integrated as constraints in a multi-objective protein optimization to generate multiple conformational states of the protein. Compared to its predecessor, M-DeepAssembly2 leverages a flexible residue prediction network that directionally decouples coevolutionary information to generate heterogeneous distance maps. Benchmark results demonstrate that this strategy enables accurate prediction of protein multiple conformations and significantly improves the precision of static multi-domain protein structure prediction.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimizing Genomic Data Compression with Genetic Algorithms</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ferrolho, R., Pinho, A. J., Pratas, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid growth of genomic data, especially in clinical settings, has highlighted the need for efficient lossless compression. Preserving full sequence information is critical, as even small data losses can affect analyses or diagnoses. With increasing dataset size and complexity, optimized compression is vital for storage, transmission, and processing. Fixed-parameter compression tools often fall short across diverse genomes, demonstrating the need for adaptive tuning strategies tailored to each dataset. In this paper, we investigate the use of metaheuristic search algorithms, particularly Genetic Algorithms (GAs), to optimize parameter configurations for JARVIS3, a genomic sequence compression tool. Due to JARVIS3's large and complex parameter space, exhaustive search is infeasible. To tackle this, we developed OptimJV3, a modular framework that integrates multiple GA variants, including a multi-objective approach that also considers computational time. We evaluated OptimJV3 on various genomic datasets (FASTA format), namely Human Chromosome Y (CY), Cassava, and the full Human Genome (HG), and observed notable compression gains. For large sequences like Cassava and HG, we applied sampling-based optimization: optimal parameters were first identified from smaller segments and then used for full sequence compression. These small segments proved effective for guiding parameter tuning. Further improvements were achieved by increasing the number of GA generations, especially for HG. For example, using a 10 MB sample and 500 generations, OptimJV3 reached a compression rate of 1.431 bits per base on HG - among the best results reported so far.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Amoeboid-Mesenchymal Transition and the Proteolytic Control of Cancer Invasion Plasticity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Olson, A. W., Li, J., +9 authors, Weiss, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Invasion plasticity allows malignant cells to toggle between collective, mesenchymal and amoeboid phenotypes while traversing extracellular matrix (ECM) barriers. Current dogma holds that collective and mesenchymal invasion programs trigger the mobilization of proteinases that digest structural barriers dominated by type I collagen, while amoeboid activity allows cancer cells to marshal mechanical forces to traverse tissues independently of ECM proteolysis. Here, we use cancer spheroid-3-dimensional matrix models, single-cell RNA sequencing, and human tissue explants to identify the mechanisms controlling mesenchymal versus amoeboid invasion. Unexpectedly, collective/mesenchymal- and amoeboid-type invasion programs, though distinct, are each characterized by active tunneling through ECM barriers, with expression of matrix-degradative metalloproteinases. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of a single membrane-anchored collagenase, MMP14/MT1-MMP, ablates tissue-invasive activity while co-regulating cancer cell transcriptional programs. Though changes in matrix architecture, nuclear rigidity, and metabolic stress as well as the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts are proposed to support amoeboid activity, none of these changes restore invasive activity of MMP14-targeted cancer cells. While a requirement for MMP14 is bypassed in low-density collagen hydrogels, invasion by the proteinase-deleted cells is associated with nuclear envelope and DNA damage, highlighting a proteolytic requirement for maintaining nuclear integrity. Nevertheless, when cancer cells confront explants of live human breast tissue, MMP14 is again required to support invasive activity. Corroborating these results, spatial transcriptomic and immunohistological analyses of invasive human breast cancers identified clear expression of MMP14 in invasive cells that were further associated with degraded collagen, underlining the pathophysiologic importance of this proteinase in directing invasive activity in vivo.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">L-asparaginase treatment induces a tumor metabolic plasticity and reveals a vulnerability to PARP1/2 inhibitor Olaparib, in B-cell lymphomas.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">AUSSEL, A., Nemazanyy, I., +13 authors, CHICHE, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intrinsic mechanisms driving secondary resistance to L-asparaginase (ASNase) treatment remain poorly understood. Using a preclinical model of B-cell lymphomas (BCL), sensitive to ASNase, we observed tumor relapse during ASNase treatment despite an initial antineoplastic response. Through in vivo metabolic profiling of BCL and stable isotope resolved metabolomics in vitro and in vivo, we show that ASNase induces a flexible metabolic reprogramming marked by increased de novo serine biosynthesis. This adaptive response is driven in part by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which mitigates ASNase-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-mediated DNA damage, enabling tumor cell survival under therapeutic pressure. ASNase-treated malignant B cells exhibit features of replication stress, with activation of the ATR-dependent DNA damage response and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP) activity. Targeting initiation of DNA repair mechanism using the PARP inhibitor Olaparib, enhances the antineoplastic effect of each individual mono-chemotherapy, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we showed that this therapeutic combination was also effective in homologous recombination (HR)-proficient colorectal cancer cells, supporting its broader therapeutic relevance beyond lymphoid malignancies. Altogether, our findings reveal redox- and DNA repair-dependent metabolic vulnerabilities in ASNase-treated B-cell lymphomas and provide proof-of-concept for a rational combination therapy using clinically approved agents, ASNase and Olaparib.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multicellular Calcium Waves in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Regulate Neuronal Mimicry and Anisotropy Leading to Immune Exclusion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Giangreco, G., Ramsden, Z., +17 authors, Sahai, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stromal barriers exclude CD8+ T cells from accessing cancer cells and hamper immune-mediated tumour control. Through multi-pronged analysis of tumours that transition from immune inflamed to immune excluded, we reveal that the formation of stromal barriers is associated with the acquisition of neuronal gene expression programmes in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), including TUBB3 expression. This leads to neuronal mimicry, with stromal barrier formation underpinned by coordinated transient bursts of intracellular calcium release, similar to those observed in neuronal tissue. Blockade of calcium release through either pharmacological or molecular interventions, such as STC2 depletion, prevents CAF alignment and the build-up of CD8+ T cells at stromal boundaries. Nintedanib treatment prevents neuronal mimicry and restores immune-mediated tumour control. Thus, we uncover unexpected mimicry of neuronal behaviour in CAFs, document the mechanism by which it leads to immune exclusion, and identify ways to prevent the induction of neuronal mimicry and restore immune-mediated tumour control.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">VEGFR2 blockade converts thermally ablative focused ultrasound into a potent driver of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Schwartz, M. R., Anwar, N. Z., +6 authors, Price, R. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Thermally ablative focused ultrasound (TFUS) can induce favorable immune signatures in solid tumors but rarely generates durable systemic immunity or enhances checkpoint inhibition. We tested whether combining TFUS with aVEGFR2, which normalizes tumor vasculature and remodels immune cell composition, triggers T cell dependent immunity and synergizes with checkpoint inhibition. Subtotal TFUS (~40% volumetric ablation fraction, matching clinical trial results) was applied to EMT6 tumors in aVEGFR2 treated BALB/c mice. In EMT6 tumors, TFUS or aVEGFR2 alone had no effect on tumor growth, but their combination eradicated 50% of tumors and drove 83% rechallenge rejection, with CD4/CD8 depletion confirming that tumor eradication and rechallenge rejection were T cell dependent. TFUS + aPD1 yielded modest benefit, whereas triple therapy (TFUS + aVEGFR2 + aPD1) cured 81% of mice and induced durable, T cell mediated immunity. Thus, VEGFR2 blockade converts clinically relevant TFUS into a potent systemic immunotherapy and, with the addition of checkpoint inhibition, offers a rational approach to combining already approved therapies for the treatment of solid tumors.</p>
