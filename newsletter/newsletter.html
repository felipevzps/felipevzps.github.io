<h2 class="paper-title">Accurate strand-specific long-read transcript isoform discovery and quantification at bulk, single-cell, and single-nucleus resolution</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yu, H., Georgescu, C., +20 authors, AlKhafaji, A. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in long-read transcriptome sequencing enable high-throughput profiling of full-length RNA isoforms in bulk, single-cell, and single-nucleus samples. However, long-read datasets typically contain a mixture of complete and partial transcripts, leading to pervasive ambiguity in read-to-isoform assignment and complicating accurate isoform identification and quantification, particularly in the absence of reliable reference annotations. These challenges are further amplified in single-cell and single-nucleus samples, where coverage is sparse and transcriptional heterogeneity is high. Here, we present the Long Read Alignment Assembler (LRAA), a unified and versatile computational framework for isoform identification and quantification from long-read RNA sequencing data across bulk, single-cell, and single-nucleus transcriptomic samples. LRAA combines splice-graph based structural modeling with expectation maximization based optimization to probabilistically resolve ambiguous read assignments and improve isoform abundance estimation. The framework supports quantification-only, reference-guided, and fully reference-free (de novo) modes of analysis within a single methodological paradigm. We benchmarked LRAA using both simulated and genuine long-read datasets spanning sequencing standards and whole transcriptomes. Central to this evaluation is a novel benchmarking strategy based on Multiplexed Overexpression of Regulatory Factors (MORFs), which provides biologically expressed, barcoded isoforms with unambiguous read-level ground truth. Across all benchmarks, including MORFs, synthetic spike-ins, and whole-transcriptome datasets, LRAA consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in isoform identification accuracy, sensitivity, and expression quantification. Finally, we demonstrate the biological utility of LRAA by resolving cell-type-specific isoform usage across peripheral blood immune cell populations and by detecting a pathogenic cryptic isoform of STMN2 with associated transcriptional changes in single-nucleus RNA-seq data from frontal cortex tissue of an individual with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Together, these results establish LRAA as a robust and general solution for resolving transcript diversity in complex biological systems, from development to disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Enhanced multi-omic viral profiling from microbial community sequencing with BAQLaVa</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jensen, J. S. L., Maharjan, S., +8 authors, Huttenhower, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Viruses are crucial components of microbial communities, both phage that infect bacterial community members as well as pathogenic and other eukaryotic viruses. However, they remain unobserved by most current technologies, due to combinations of experimental and analytical factors. To address the latter, we developed the BAQLaVa algorithm for high-resolution profiling of &gt;120,000 viral species (viral genome bins, VGBs) via reference-based metagenome (MGX) or metatranscriptome (MTX) alignment to complementary nucleotide markers and proteome sets. In comprehensive benchmarking, BAQLaVa substantially outperformed alternatives, achieving species-level recall and precision regularly over 90%. We applied BAQLaVa to MGX and MTX samples from the HMP2 IBDMDB cohort to identify previously undescribed viral perturbations in inflammatory bowel diseases. Most notably, virome diversity was reduced in tandem with bacterial diversity during inflammation, in contrast to previous findings based on a narrower range of viral detection. A subset of viruses were enriched during IBD, associated with carriage of abortive infection anti-defense systems such as AbiL and PD-{lambda}-2, as well as genes involved in the regulation of lysogeny. Leveraging the corresponding viral profiles, we also inferred phage-host relationships using scalable co-occurrence and covariation signals, even in the absence of host references or genome annotations. By enabling high sensitivity and specificity viral profiling from metagenomes or metatranscriptomes, BAQLaVa provides a scalable framework for virome epidemiology and systematic analysis of virus-host interactions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">miRXplain: explainable isomiR-aware microRNA target prediction using CLIP-L experiments and hybrid attention transformers</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Maji, R. K., Cantini, G., +2 authors, Schulz, M. H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nt long noncoding RNAs that repress genes by base-pairing with complementary sequences in target mRNAs. Variants known as isomiRs arise from alternative hairpin processing and often shift the canonical seed region, thereby altering their target repertoire. Yet, the mRNA features that enable differential miRNA and isomiR target selection remain poorly understood, largely due to limited high-throughput assays that capture the exact miRNA bound to each target. Existing deep learning methods for miRNA-target prediction have neither leveraged such datasets nor investigated isomiR-specific interactions. To fill this gap, we developed miRXplain, an isomiR-aware transformer that predicts miRNA-mRNA interactions using miRNA and target sequences derived from CLIP-L data, directly linking precise miRNA variants to their target sites. These data however revealed a 5'-end nucleotide bias in target sites, which we corrected to generate high-quality, miRNA-target pairs for training, preserving isomiR-specific signal. MiRXplain outperformed all benchmarked models, surpassing TEC-miTarget, in auROC and auPRC with 15x fewer parameters. Attention maps highlighted distinct sequence determinants for canonical versus isomiR interactions, and in silico saturation mutagenesis highlighted the importance of seed and 3' supplementary regions. miRXplain effectively prioritizes pathogenic single-nucleotide variants affecting mRNA-miRNA interactions and reveals isomiR targeting principles that deepen our understanding of miRNA biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EnzFinder: a sustainable alternative to chemical synthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jain, A., Pandey, N., Roy, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enzymes have emerged as an important alternative to traditional catalysts in chemical industries over the past few decades owing to their sustainable nature. The application of enzymes in chemical synthesis relies on their ability to catalyse promiscuous reactions. Promiscuous activity of enzymes is an abundant phenomenon in nature; approximately 37% of Escherichia coli K12 enzymes show promiscuous activity. This highlights the vast expanse of chemical reactions that can be made biochemically feasible through selection of the correct candidate enzymes. Here, we present EnzFinder, a promiscuous enzyme prediction tool that filters candidate enzymes based on similarity in chemical transformation patterns and subsequently ranks them using substrate product similarity, enabling enzyme prioritization up to the fourth level of EC classification without requiring sequence information. On a blind benchmarking set of 2,309 biochemical reactions, the method achieves substantially higher prediction accuracy than existing rule based and deep learning approaches, with improvements exceeding 20% at the sub subclass level and significantly higher coverage at the fourth level. Application to industrially relevant reactions demonstrates EnzFinder ability to identify alternative enzymes with higher substrate similarity and improved kinetic potential. Furthermore, integration of EnzFinder with in silico retrosynthesis tools enables effective prioritization of enzymatic steps within hybrid chemical biological pathways. Together, these results establish EnzFinder as a practical and interpretable tool for accelerating enzyme discovery and promoting greener, enzyme driven synthesis routes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Outpacing E. coli: Development of Vibrio natriegens as a Next-Generation Cloning Host</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wei, E., Louie, M., +8 authors, Weinstock, M. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite transformative advances in DNA synthesis, sequencing, and automation that have accelerated recombinant DNA workflows, molecular cloning hosts have scarcely evolved past the Escherichia coli strains adopted out of convenience in the 1970s. We present NBx CyClone - an engineered strain of Vibrio natriegens - as a next-generation host for molecular cloning. This non-pathogenic marine bacterium combines broad plasmid and genetic tool compatibility, a versatile metabolism, and the fastest known doubling time of any free-living organism. By shortening growth-dependent steps, this host offers a practical route to faster, more efficient recombinant DNA workflows across research and industry.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dynamic Consistency Reveals Predictable Genes in Cross-Cell Type Temporal scRNA-Seq Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Shi, J., Wu, R., +1 author, Duprey, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how gene expression evolves over time after trauma is central to modeling immune responses, yet single-cell temporal data remain sparse and heterogeneous across cell types. Using a temporal trauma scRNA-seq dataset, we formulate the task of predicting next-time gene expression from earlier observations under a cross-cell-type generalization setting. We introduce the Dynamic Consistency Index (DCI), which quantifies how consistently a gene's temporal trajectory aligns across cell types, serving as a measure of biological regularity and predictability. High-DCI genes exhibit reproducible temporal dynamics and are markedly easier to model. By integrating DCI-based gene selection with a recurrent neural architecture trained under a Gaussian negative log-likelihood objective, we achieve superior accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty compared to deterministic baselines. Overall, DCI reliably identifies dynamically consistent genes, and uncertainty-aware recurrent modeling provides a robust framework for capturing cross-cell-type gene-expression evolution.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">MOSAIC: A Spectral Framework for Integrative Phenotypic Characterization Using Population-Level Single-Cell Multi-Omics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, C., Kluger, Y., Ma, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Population-scale single-cell multi-omics offers unprecedented opportunities to link molecular variation to human health and disease. However, existing methods for single-cell multi-omics analysis are either cell-centric, prioritizing batch-corrected cell embeddings that neglect feature relationships, or feature-centric, imposing global feature representations that overlook inter-sample heterogeneity. To address these limitations, we present MOSAIC, a spectral framework that learns a high-resolution feature x sample joint embedding from population-scale single-cell multi-omics data. For each individual, MOSAIC constructs a sample-specific coupling matrix capturing complete intra- and cross-modality feature interactions, then projects these into a shared latent space via spectral decomposition. The joint feature x sample embedding defines each feature's connectivity profile per sample, enabling two key downstream applications. First, MOSAIC introduces Differential Connectivity (DC) analysis, which identifies features exhibiting regulatory network rewiring across conditions even when their expression or abundance remains unchanged. Applied to a CITE-seq vaccination cohort, MOSAIC revealed rewiring of proliferation programs in activated T cells, highlighting a functional shift in STAT5B despite stable expression. Second, MOSAIC enables identification of biologically meaningful sample subgroups by isolating coherent multimodal feature modules. Applied to an HIV+ prefrontal cortex cohort, MOSAIC uncovered a novel stress-driven neuronal subtype within HIV+ samples characterized by elevated protein synthesis without chromatin accessibility changes. MOSAIC provides a general-purpose framework for systems-level phenotypic characterization, offering novel biological insights from population-scale multi-omic studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">tensorOmics: Data integration for longitudinal omics data using tensor factorisation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kodikara, S., Lu, B., +1 author, Le Cao, K.-A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multi-omics studies capture comprehensive molecular profiles across biological layers to understand complex biological processes. A central challenge is integrating information across heterogeneous data types to identify coordinated molecular responses, particularly when measurements are collected longitudinally. Traditional integration methods can be broadly classified as unsupervised (exploring patterns without phenotypic information) or supervised (discriminating between groups or predicting outcomes). These approaches rely predominantly on matrix-based techniques that concatenate or project data into lower-dimensional spaces. However, matrix methods struggle with longitudinal data, as flattening multi-dimensional structures obscures temporal trajectories and violates independence assumptions. Tensor-based methods preserve the natural multi-way structure of longitudinal data but existing approaches are predominantly unsupervised, cannot incorporate phenotypic responses for discriminant analysis, and lack frameworks for integrating multiple omics layers. We present tensorOmics, a comprehensive framework for longitudinal omics analysis using tensor factorisation. The framework encompasses supervised and unsupervised methods for both single-omic (tensor PCA, tensor PLS discriminant analysis) and multi-omic settings (tensor PLS, block tensor PLS, block tensor PLS discriminant analysis). This unified approach captures coordinated responses across biological layers while preserving temporal structure. We validated tensorOmics through three case studies: antibiotic perturbation experiments, anaerobic digestion systems, and fecal microbiota transplantation. These applications demonstrate tensorOmics differentiates treatment groups, captures time-dependent molecular signatures, and reveals multi-layer coordinated responses that cross-sectional methods miss.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Spatiotemporal cell type deconvolution leveraging tissue structure</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lobo, M. M., Zhang, Z., Zhang, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spot-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) captures aggregated transcriptomic profiles at spatial locations (spots) in tissue slices. Cell type deconvolution methods decode each spot and estimate the proportion of every cell type in the spot, necessary for uncovering spatial cell type distributions for further downstream analyses. Existing methods utilize cell type markers or reference transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) atlases at single cell (sc) resolution, or by aggregating profiles of identified cell types. However, current methods fail to effectively utilize the 3D tissue layout and single cell resolution reference. Some leverage 2D spatial organization assuming proximal spots are similar, which may be violated around boundaries or isolated cell types. We present SpaDecoder, a parallelized matrix factorization-based per-spot deconvolution method for multiple 3D spatial or temporal ST tissue slices effectively leveraging tissue structure with an adaptively inferred 3D neighborhood Gaussian kernel. We additionally account for variability in sc-reference profiles, along with batch effects. The mathematical framework of SpaDecoder allows it to be used for a range of downstream analyses. It can decode anteroposterior variability, impute gene expression, uncover putatively key tissue regions, identify colocalized cell types and predict spatio-temporal scRNA-seq cell locations. Ablation tests along with comparisons against other methods on various metrics, datasets, and scenarios, collectively show that SpaDecoder effectively harnesses 3D tissue structure and sc-reference profiles to improve cell type deconvolution. SpaDecoder is available at https://github.com/ZhangLabGT/spadecoder.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Viscoelasticity drives EMT in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pascucci, A., Karim, S. A., +2 authors, Walker, M. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is a precursor of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and therefore critical to understand for identifying early-stage diagnostic and therapeutic targets. During PanIN, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic epithelial cancer cells is a crucial event which promotes invasion and early dissemination of cells into circulation before the full development of PDAC tumours. Changes in tissue mechanics are apparent during progression from PanIN to PDAC and increased local and global elasticity has been mathematically modelled in PanIN tissue as a predictive tool for diagnostics and development of personalized therapies. Aside from elasticity, viscoelasticity is emerging as a key feature of cancer which affects tissue mechanics through a combination of elastic and viscous components. Viscoelasticity has recently been shown to drive mechanosensitive cell behaviour and is known to change dramatically in PDAC progression. Hydrogels, as water-swollen polymer networks, are effective extracellular matrix (ECM) models that can recapitulate the viscoelastic properties of natural tissue. Despite this, hydrogels developed for studying cell behaviour in PanIN use purely elastic materials or have neglected the viscous component. Here, using PDAC mouse models, we show that viscoelasticity dynamically alters between healthy and PanIN-bearing tissue and have decoupled the role of elasticity and viscosity during EMT of pancreatic epithelial cancer cells using two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels. Our work shows viscosity is critical in driving phenotypic changes associated with EMT in a pancreatic epithelial cancer cell line. These findings identify viscosity as an integral component of cell mechanosensing as PanIN develops, which may contribute to initial metastatic events via dissemination from the developing primary tumour. This should be explored further to potentially reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Apc truncation enforces optimal Wnt signalling during early intestinal tumourigenesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">van Driel, M. S., de Groot, N. E., van Hooff, S. R., Koster, J., Vermeulen, L., van Neerven, S. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colorectal cancer (CRC) development is frequently initiated by inactivation of tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), resulting in hyperactivation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling pathway. The level of Wnt pathway activation is determined by the number of functional {beta}-catenin binding site repeats retained within the truncated APC protein. Accumulating evidence indicates that acquisition of the second APC mutational event is non-random and selects for mutations that confer a 'just right' level of Wnt activity, suggesting that tumour initiation requires Wnt signalling to be maintained within a specific range. In this study, we investigated how specific Apc mutations modulate Wnt pathway activity and downstream cellular programs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated mouse intestinal organoid cultures harbouring distinct alterations in the number of {beta}-catenin binding repeats. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the number of retained repeats and Wnt signalling activity. Notably, organoids retaining higher numbers of functional repeats were subjected to selective pressure, resulting in the acquisition of additional mutations that lead to increased Wnt activity, consistent with the 'just right' model. Transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing revealed that clones with distinct {beta}-catenin binding capacity exhibit differential transcriptional programs, including graded changes in cell cycle activity and a metabolic shift associated with progressive loss of {beta}-catenin binding repeats. Together, these findings reveal functional and metabolic heterogeneity among Apc -mutant cells, support the existence of selective pressures for optimal Wnt signalling during tumor initiation, and identify potential metabolic vulnerabilities that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention including interception of premalignant lesions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Kynurenine Metabolism Mediates Tumor Progression in Renal Cell Carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Miller, K. M., Rounseville, S., +6 authors, Sutphin, G. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP), which converts tryptophan to NAD+ while generating immunomodulatory metabolites. Therapeutic efforts have focused on inhibiting IDO1 at the pathway entry point, but the functional consequences of targeting downstream KP enzymes remain poorly characterized. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate knockouts of three KP enzymes in the RENCA murine RCC model--kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO)--and evaluated effects on cell migration, colony formation, tumor burden, metastasis, and survival. KMO and QPRT knockouts consistently reduced migratory capacity and colony size in vitro. However, in vivo effects were distinct: while QPRT knockout reduced tumor burden, KMO knockout did not. Notably, we did not detect metastasis in female mice receiving KMO knockout RENCA cells. HAAO knockout produced divergent effects, increasing migration and colony size in vitro, but reducing tumor burden and metastasis in vivo. Mice challenged orthotopically with all three knockout cell lines had significantly extended survival compared to mice receiving wild type cells. These results indicate that individual KP enzymes exert distinct, context-dependent effects on RCC progression. The enhanced in vitro aggressiveness coupled with reduced in vivo tumorigenicity observed in HAAO knockout RENCA cells illustrates that cell culture phenotypes do not reliably predict tumor behavior, particularly when perturbing metabolic pathways with pleiotropic effects. Our findings suggest that targeting specific KP enzymes warrants further investigation as a therapeutic strategy in RCC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Framework for Comparing Mouse Neoantigen Immunogenicity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Matulich, P. J., Sprague, C. N., +3 authors, Burger, M. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses targeting tumor neoantigens are critical for immunotherapy efficacy and are widely studied across different preclinical mouse tumor models. Defined neoantigens are commonly introduced to enable tracking of tumor-specific T cells; however, variation in neoantigen choice may yield immune phenotypes attributable to differences in neoantigen immunogenicity, complicating interpretation of tumor-intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we determined the relative immunogenicity of a set of 25 commonly used mouse tumor-derived and model neoantigens to facilitate comparison of neoantigens across studies. We found that in silico predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding affinity poorly stratified in vivo immunogenicity. In contrast, experimental measurement of peptide-MHC complex stability (Koff), more so than measured affinity (KD), closely correlated with the relative magnitude of neoantigen-targeted vaccine responses in vivo. Thus, we report the relative stability of a known set of commonly used neoantigens as a reference and provide a simple method to benchmark novel neoantigens against this library. This framework will allow contextualization of the level of immunogenicity of newly identified neoantigens and aid in comparative interpretation of tumor-immune phenotypes across studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Reinforcement learning-guided segment anything model for MRI prostate and dominant intraprostatic lesions auto-segmentation.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen J, Hu M, +7 authors, Yang X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Objective. Accurate segmentation of the prostate and dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important for prostate cancer radiation therapy treatment planning and targeted dose escalation. However, DIL segmentation remains challenging due to small datasets, institutional bias, and variable imaging protocols. Although the segment anything model (SAM) has shown promise in medical image segmentation, most prior work depends on manual prompts. This study developed a fully automated pipeline that combines localization with a fine-tuned SAM model to segment the prostate and DIL.Approach. Two datasets were utilized: the PI-CAI dataset, comprising 1476 patients, and the cancer imaging archive dataset, comprising 803 patients. The pipeline consisted of two stages: (1) a reinforcement learning-based localization network predicted bounding boxes as segmentation inputs, and (2) a fine-tuned SAM model performed segmentation. Model performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), and detection rates, with additional analysis based on lesion volumes.Main results. The proposed method achieved a mean and median DSC of 0.896 ± 0.070 and 0.915, and an IoU of 0.818 ± 0.100 and 0.844 for prostate segmentation. For DIL segmentation, the mean and median DSC were 0.592 ± 0.192 and 0.636, IoU of 0.446 ± 0.190 and 0.466, with a detection rate of 89%. Four DIL groups were created based on lesion volume percentile. The mean/median DSC and IoU for each volume group are as follows: 0.5-1.0 cubic centimeters (cc): 0.555 ± 0.201/0.562 &amp; 0.414 ± 0.205/0.391; 1.0-1.8 cc: 0.603 ± 0.185/0.660 &amp; 0.454 ± 0.180/0.492; 1.8-4.0 cc: 0.588 ± 0.183/0.627 &amp; 0.439 ± 0.174/0.456; &gt;4.0 cc: 0.621 ± 0.197/0.669 &amp; 0.477 ± 0.197/0.503.Significance. This study presented a fully automated prostate and DIL segmentation framework on MRI by integrating a localization network with fine-tuned SAM. The method achieved robust performance across large multi-institutional datasets and diverse lesion shapes. It shows strong potential for application to clinical workflows for prostate cancer radiation therapy planning and treatment.</p>
