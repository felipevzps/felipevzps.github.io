<h2 class="paper-title">Cross-Platform Calibration of Epigenetic Age Between the EPICv2 and MSA Arrays</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tomo, Y., Shoji, T., Nakaki, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epigenetic clocks are regression models that predict biological age based on the DNA methylation patterns. They are developed using DNA methylation array data; however, systematic differences in the predicted values between the Infinium Methylation Screening Array (MSA) and Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip (EPICv2) platforms have not been evaluated. We quantified the systematic differences between the MSA and EPICv2 arrays for six major epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, GrimAge v2, and DunedinPACE) using $166$ identical human blood samples measured on both platforms. The mean differences (MSA $-$ EPICv2) ranged from $-7.99$ years for PhenoAge to $21.8$ years for the Hannum clock, despite strong correlations between platforms ($r = 0.854$ -- $0.991$). Based on these training data, we developed three linear regression models to correct the MSA-based epigenetic clocks: Model 1 (offset location correction), Model 2 (slope and location correction), and Model 3 (slope and location correction with covariates). Validation on $48$ independent samples measured at a different institution showed that all models reduced cross-platform bias. Although Model 3 tended to achieve the lowest bias; $0.204$ years for PhenoAge and $0.383$ years for GrimAge v2, Model 1, which was the simplest, provided a sufficient correction: $-0.541$ years of bias for PhenoAge and $0.516$ for GrimAge v2. These methods are expected to enable reliable comparisons of epigenetic age across platforms and facilitate large-scale epigenetic studies.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Rigorous Quantitative Analysis of Nonlinear Uncertain Biomolecular Systems using Validated Methods</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">PRAKASH, R., Sen, S.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The paper addresses the critical challenge of accurately characterising steady states in biomolecular systems, which are often complex, nonlinear, multistable and subject to significant uncertainties. Traditional numerical methods often fail to provide complete or guaranteed solutions under these conditions. To overcome these limitations, the research proposes and evaluates the application of interval analysis methodologies. We provided algorithms for interval Newton and interval Krawczyk methods for rigorously bounding all possible steady states (both stable and unstable) in multistable, multidimensional nonlinear systems. This study involves a comparative analysis of these two methods in conjunction with interval bisection and interval constraint propagation. We addressed numerical examples for an array of biologically plausible models, involving both feedback and feedforward gene networks. The work recommends the choice of the most suitable method for various types of biomolecular systems, ultimately offering a robust computational framework to understand cellular functions and design synthetic biological circuits.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">evo3D: a generalised framework for structure-informed evolutionary analysis, implemented in R</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Broyles, B. K., He, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Selection pressures often act at the level of protein structure, yet most evolutionary analyses remain confined to linear sequences. Early structure-informed approaches improved interpretation by mapping single-site metrics onto protein structures, and later methods introduced 3D sliding windows to capture spatial neighbourhoods missed by linear analyses. These frameworks, however, are restricted to predefined statistics and narrowly defined 3D window types, limiting the scope of questions that can be addressed. We developed an R package, evo3D, a generalised framework for structure-informed evolutionary analysis that supports any downstream statistic and scales from simple to complex structures. evo3D extracts structure-informed multiple sequence alignment subsets (spatial haplotypes), making the structure-informed unit of analysis directly available to users. The framework provides fixed-count and fixed-distance spatial windows, supports residue and codon analysis modes, and extends across multimers, interfaces, and multiple structural models through a single wrapper, run_evo3d(). We demonstrate evo3D's utility by performing an epitope-level diversity scan of Hepatitis C virus E1/E2 complex, identifying conserved spatial neighbourhoods missed by linear sliding windows, and by evaluating evo3D's scalability on the octameric Chikungunya virus E1/E2 assembly. By formalising the core components of structure-informed genetic analysis and removing the technical barriers, evo3D streamlines the evaluation of evolutionary patterns directly within 3D structural contexts and we anticipate its wide application in molecular evolution studies. The package is available at github.com/bbroyle/evo3D.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SEEK-VEC: Robust Latent Structure Discovery via Ensemble Topic Modeling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Danning, R., Ke, Z. T., +1 author, Lin, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Count data are ubiquitous across many applications in which understanding hidden patterns, or latent structure, is of interest. Topic modeling is a powerful tool for detecting latent structure in count data. However, standard topic modeling methods are often constrained by their restrictive assumptions, susceptible to noise, and sensitive to misspecification of the number of topics, which is particularly of concern when analyzing non-text data. Here, we introduce SEEK-VEC (Spectral Ensembling of topic models with Eigenscore for K-agnostic Vocabulary Embedding and Classification), an ensemble framework for count data that integrates insights from multiple candidate topic models through a spectral ensembling procedure. This approach automatically reinforces signal and mitigates noise to generate a consensus low-dimensional embedding of the data. SEEK-VEC produces prioritization scores and grouping scores that enable variable classification, interactive pattern discovery, and model diagnostics. Through simulations, we demonstrate that SEEK-VEC is robust under realistic settings and outperforms state-of-the-art oracle methods, particularly when signal strength is weak. Applied to diverse real-world datasets, including self-reported psychopathology symptom data, food preference questionnaires, and single-cell transcriptomics, SEEK-VEC reveals latent structures that provide scientifically meaningful insights.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Single-cell whole-genome sequencing reveals convergent evolution in Burkitt lymphoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Steemers, A. S., van Roosmalen, M. J., Hagelaar, R., +3 authors, Meyer-Wentrup, F., van Boxtel, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Burkitt lymphoma (BL) carries multiple oncogenic drivers yet arises predominantly in children, whose normal cells harbour few age-related mutations. To investigate this paradox, we sought to define the sequence and timing of mutational drivers underlying BL development. Here, we analysed single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 250 paired normal and malignant B-cells from BL patients and integrated this data with 21 bulk WGS samples and an existing dataset of 157 clonally expanded B-cells from healthy individuals. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed an accelerated accumulation of mutations following the emergence of the most recent common ancestor, leading to the early establishment of extensive genetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We further provide evidence that convergent evolution shapes this diversity at both the point mutation- and copy number variation-levels. This in-depth characterisation further establishes BL as a paradigmatic model of tumorigenesis with implications for therapeutic intervention.</p>
