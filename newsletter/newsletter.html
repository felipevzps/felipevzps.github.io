<h2 class="paper-title">COLSTATS: an interactive web platform for systematic colocalization of GWAS and QTL summary statistics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Diana, M. A., Onano, S., +4 authors, Pala, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalization of GWAS with QTL data is pivotal for identifying shared genetic determinants of molecular traits and diseases yet remains hindered by fragmented data sources and technical barriers. COLSTATS addresses this gap by offering a web-based Shiny platform that integrates 1,648,851 harmonized summary statistic datasets from key resources (GWAS Catalog, UK Biobank, GTEx, BluePrint, eQTLGen, and immune-phenotype studies), all formatted as VCFs aligned to hg38 with uniform chr_pos_ref_alt variant identifiers. Users can interactively select two traits, specify a genomic region or gene, define priors, and execute colocalization via coloc.abf, with results displayed in tabular and graphical form, downloadable as PDF, CSV, or PNG. The system includes result caching, history tracking, and an intuitive interface for streamlined exploration. COLSTATS is freely accessible at https://colstats.irgb.cnr.it. This resource empowers researchers, including non-bioinformaticians, to perform transparent and reproducible colocalization analyses efficiently.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SCANBIT facilitates identification of tumor cell populations in scRNAseq data using pseudobulked SNV calls</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cannon, M. V., Gust, M. J., +8 authors, Roberts, R. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) is an ideal tool to characterize the heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, however, accurate identification of tumor cells can be a challenge. Reference-based methods can be inaccurate, if reference datasets are even available. Current purpose-built methods can be inaccurate, particularly with highly heterogeneous tumor types. Improved methods are needed. We explored the use of genetic variants to distinguish tumor from normal cells within scRNAseq data. Results: We characterized the limitations inherent to calling variants from scRNAseq data, quantifying how data sparsity precludes genetic distance calculation between single cells. As a novel workaround, we pooled data from transcriptionally similar cell clusters to call high quality variants and then calculated pairwise differences between cell populations and performed hierarchical clustering. We quantified confidence in genetic divergence between tumor and normal cell populations using bootstrapping. We performed extensive validation to assess accurate identification of tumor cells using ground-truth datasets. Application of our method to human scRNAseq samples highlighted the utility of our approach and revealed how mutational burden influences successful tumor cell identification. Improved cell type assignment in scRNAseq data will facilitate analysis of tumor samples and, in turn, accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and reveal potential biological vulnerabilities that can be exploited to develop improved treatment options. Availability and implementation: Our method is publicly available as an R package: SCANBIT (Single Cell Altered Nucleotide Based Inference of Tumor) https://github.com/kidcancerlab/scanBit.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fairness-aware Supervised Hierarchical Contrastive Semantic Learning for Sexual Dimorphism Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ko, E., Parsa, S. P., +2 authors, Kang, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Sexual dimorphism is a fundamental biological determinant driving systematic differences in disease susceptibility, progression, and clinical outcomes. However, current AI-based genomic models often exhibit algorithmic bias and fail to capture these sex-specific mechanisms, creating a critical barrier to unbiased precision medicine. Ensuring fairness in the context of sexual dimorphism requires understanding and addressing the distinct biological mechanisms functioning in each sex, rather than focusing solely on equalizing predictive performance. Results: We propose a fairness-aware supervised hierarchical contrastive learning approach, called FairHICON, to discover unbiased sex-common and sex-specific genomic drivers. Evaluations on cancer and asthma transcriptomic datasets demonstrate that FairHICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, improving predictive performance by up to 9% while effectively reducing the performance gap between male and female cohorts. Furthermore, prognostic validation confirms that the identified sex-specific pathways stratify patient survival significantly better within their corresponding sex groups. This validates FairHICON to elucidate the molecular heterogeneity of sexual dimorphism, advancing inclusive precision medicine. Availability and implementation: The source code and data is available at https://github.com/datax-lab/FairHICON.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Knowledge-Guided Learning with Curated Prior Genetic Biomarkers for Robust Model Interpretation</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Baek, B., Jang, E., +1 author, Kang, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Knowledge-guided learning offers effective and robust model training strategies in data-scarce settings by incorporating established domain knowledge, thereby enhancing generalization, robustness, and interpretability. By contrast, conventional deep learning approaches rely purely on data-driven learning, which can limit robust model interpretability, particularly in high-dimensional settings with limited size samples. In computational biology, knowledgeguided learning has primarily leveraged network- and structural-based knowledge, leading to biologically interpretable representations and enhanced predictive performance compared to conventional approaches. However, curated biomarkers, one of the most accessible forms of biological knowledge, remain largely unexplored within knowledge-guided paradigms. Results: In this study, we propose a model-agnostic training paradigm, Biomarker-driven Explainable Prior-guided Learning (BioExPL), that can be applied to any neural networks that incorporates curated prior knowledge. BioExPL enforces neural networks to reflect curated biomarker priors in their latent representations through a novel knowledge alignment loss. BioExPL consistently demonstrated significantly improved predictive performance and enhanced model interpretability with minimized computational overhead in simulation studies and intensive experiments on multiple cancer datasts. BioExPL not only integrates prior curated knowledge into the model but also accurately identifies unknown associated signals additionally. BioExPL is model-agnostic and domain-independent, enabling its integration into diverse neural network architectures. Availability and implementation: The open-source is publicly available at: https://github.com/datax-lab/BioExPL.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PIMO: Pathway-based Interpretable Multi-Omics interactions for multi-omics integration</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Parsa, S. P., Kosaraju, S. C., +3 authors, Kang, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Modeling inter-omics interactions across multiple molecular levels is critical for deciphering the mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Epigenomic and structural alterations, such as DNA methylation and copy number alterations, modulate gene expression and collectively influence disease progression and patient survival outcomes. Despite advancements in deep learning-based multi-omics analysis, gene-level interactions of inter-omics have been seldom considered, due to combinational complexity and power, which limits interpretability and mechanistic insight. Results: We propose a Pathway-based Interpretable deep learning Multi-Omics interaction model, PIMO, that explicitly captures regulatory effects across omics layers. Experiments on multiple TCGA cancer datasets showed that PIMO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in survival analysis, up to 13% increase in the C-index. PIMO provides biologically interpretable analyses that identify important pathways, genes, and inter-omics interactions with DNA methylation and copy number alterations.

<h2 class="paper-title">Geometric Multidimensional Representation of Omic Signatures</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Almeida Cordeiro Nogueira, H., Medina-Acosta, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multi-omic signatures are widely used in biomarker discovery, precision oncology, and systems biology, yet they are typically treated as vectors or composite scores that collapse intrinsically multidimensional biological organization into one-dimensional summaries. As a result, their internal structure, contextual dependencies, and mechanistic coherence remain largely inaccessible. Here, we introduce a geometric framework that reconceptualizes omic signatures as multidimensional informational entities whose biological meaning arises from structural organization rather than molecular membership alone. Each signature is embedded in a shared latent space integrating regulatory, phenotypic, microenvironmental, immune, and clinical constraints, and represented as a convex polytope. This representation preserves internal organization and enables intrinsic geometric measurements - including barycenter distance, volume, anisotropy, and asymmetry - that quantify concordance, divergence, and latent complexity. We apply this framework to 24,796 metabolic regulatory circuitries reconstructed across 32 TCGA cancer types, encoded as paired regulatory and metabolic signatures in an 18-dimensional latent space. Geometric analysis shows that discordance predominates: most circuitries occupy strong or extreme discordance regimes and display high-dimensional, frequently asymmetric geometries, whereas fully concordant circuitries are rare and structurally constrained. These geometric phenotypes stratify metabolic pathways and superfamilies in reproducible, non-uniform patterns that are not detectable with vector- or network-based representations. By transforming omic signatures into measurable geometric objects, this framework enables principled comparison, de-redundancy, and mechanistic interpretation of multi-omic biomarkers, providing a scalable approach for analyzing complex regulatory systems across cancer and beyond. All geometric representations and derived descriptors are available through the SigPolytope Shiny application (https://sigpolytope.shinyapps.io/geometricatlas/).</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bioimaging Data Management Workflow for Plasma Medicine</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ahmadi, M., Wagner, R., +1 author, Becker, M. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bioimaging experiments in plasma medicine generate complex datasets that go beyond conventional imaging studies by combining microscopy data with heterogeneous metadata from biological experiments and highly parameterized gas plasma treatments. Plasma exposure conditions, such as device configuration, gas composition, and treatment conditions, are critical determinants of biological outcome, yet they are rarely captured in a standardized, machine-readable, and reusable manner. To address this gap, we present a research data management (RDM) workflow that operationalizes the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles across the bioimaging data lifecycle in plasma medicine. The workflow is implemented as a structured pipeline integrating open-source tools, including OMERO for image data management, eLabFTW as an electronic laboratory notebook, Adamant for schema-driven metadata collection, and Micro-Meta App for standardized documentation of microscopy acquisition settings that are connected via programming interfaces to enable persistent linkage of metadata to image datasets using standardized annotations. The workflow is documented in a reproducible tutorial with an open-source Python Jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub. By integrating plasma treatment metadata with imaging data, this approach improves reproducibility, cross-study comparability, and data reuse in plasma medicine research.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fail closed trust gated synthetic augmentation governs tail risk under subject shift in EEG</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Choi, D., Yip, C., +1 author, Park, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic augmentation can silently harm subject-disjoint EEG generalization. We propose trust-gated augmentation (TGA), a control layer that scores synthetic windows with a teacher trained on real data for label consistency and confidence; only samples above a confidence quantile q are eligible. A fail-closed selector injects synthetic data only if validation AUROC exceeds real-only by a margin, otherwise reverting to real-only. In PainMunich chronic-pain EEG (n=189) at 5% subject scarcity, ungated augmentation harmed 56% of paired runs (delta-AUROC &lt; -0.01), whereas TGA at q=0.99 reduced harm to 24% with comparable mean AUROC. In BCI IV-2a motor imagery (n=9) at 25% scarcity, strict gating improved AUROC (0.679 vs 0.627) and reduced harm (0.16 vs 0.44). A covariance-manifold audit showed synthetic windows were strongly off-manifold (mean distance ratio 2.39 x 10^4), motivating explicit governance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Efficient and scalable Python implementation of ANCOM-BC for omics differential abundance testing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wu, Z., Lin, H., +1 author, Zhu, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> ANCOM-BC (Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction) is a critical algorithm for differential abundance analysis. Designed for handling compositional data, it features the ability to estimate the unknown sampling fractions and correct the bias induced by their differences. While the original R package is robust for standard dataset sizes, the increasing magnitude of modern multi-omics studies presents computational challenges, often resulting in runtime bottleneck for high-dimensional data. Here, we present a native Python implementation of ANCOM-BC in the scikit-bio package that significantly accelerates the workflow, enabling its application to large-scale datasets. By leveraging the vectorization with NumPy and numerical optimization in SciPy, we enhanced the efficiency without compromising the statistical accuracy of the method. The benchmarking results revealed a dramatic increase in performance in both simulated and real datasets. We demonstrated that our Python implementation generates test results that match the original R package, while achieving a 100-fold acceleration in runtime and an 87% reduction in memory consumption. This new implementation allows for the analysis of datasets that are significantly larger than previously possible, and enables applications to alternative omics data types and complex statistical models that vary greatly by the number of samples, features, and covariates.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Global mRNA 3'UTR lengthening in small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Y., Zhao, X., +14 authors, Xia, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) is a rare but highly malignant tumor subtype that primarily arises in the lung, also rarely in other organs, and as a consequence of treatment induced lineage transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinomas. The molecular convergence of SCNC across diverse tissues enables its identification through conserved SCNC-specific molecular markers, facilitating tumor subtype classification. As a critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, alternative polyadenylation (APA) modulates 3'UTR length and significantly impacts tumor progression. However, its role in SCNC remains largely unclear. Here, we report a global 3'UTR lengthening pattern driven by APA in SCNC. We identified a set of conserved 3'UTR lengthening events across SCNCs of different tissue origins, which are strongly associated with neural development and related signaling pathways. Furthermore, we developed a neural network-based prediction model to classify SCNC by leveraging these specific APA signatures. Our study provides new insights into the post-transcriptional landscape of SCNCs and highlights APA signatures as promising biomarkers for SCNC identification.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Mechanical Stiffening Promotes Growth, Invasion, and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) Inhibitor Resistance in 3D Plexiform Neurofibroma Cultures</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ji, K., Shi, C., Zhang, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Plexiform neurofibromas with neurofibromatosis type I (pNF1s) are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors caused by Nf1 loss, leading to dysregulated RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. While MEK inhibitors, selumetinib and mirdametinib, can reduce tumor volume, surgical resection remains the primary treatment for immediate debulking and symptom relief. Complete removal is often limited by tumor infiltration along nerve plexuses, and residual tumors may undergo postsurgical tissue remodeling, producing localized regions of stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM). The impact of ECM stiffness on pNF1 progression and drug response is unknown. Using patient-derived pNF1 tumor cells cultured in 3D hydrogels with defined stiffness (1.5 kPa soft, 7 kPa stiff), we found that stiff ECM promoted spread morphology, increased growth, and progressive intracellular softening. Stiff ECM reduced lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression, reflecting mechanoadaptive ECM remodeling, and upregulated P-glycoprotein, leading to decreased sensitivity to selumetinib. These results provide the first evidence that ECM stiffening, such as that arising from postsurgical remodeling, directly drives pNF1 progression and therapeutic resistance. Our findings highlight mechanobiology as a key regulator of tumor behavior and support targeting ECM mechanics to improve clinical outcomes in NF1 patients.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CMTM6-Silencing Microbial Immunotherapy Reprograms PDAC Tumors and Restores T-cell Function</h2>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite recent advances in immunotherapy for advanced malignancies, Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains largely refractory to current immunotherapy due to dense fibrosis, limited antigen presentation, and myeloid-driven immune suppression. Here we report the tumor-targeting, immune remodeling, and safety profiles of the attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain CRC2631, and of iSTORM, a next-generation derivative engineered for tumor-localized CMTM6 silencing. CRC2631 preferentially colonizes orthotopic and genetically engineered PDAC tumors, with enrichment in primary lesions and metastases. Tumor-localized CRC2631 induces chemokine and adhesion programs consistent with leukocyte recruitment, increases intratumoral activated T-cell fractions, and triggers transcriptional signatures aligned with innate sensing, interferon signaling, antigen-processing and presentation, and apoptosis programs. iSTORM extends this platform by delivering CMTM6-targeting shRNA to modulate a PD-L1-stabilizing, myeloid-associated immune-evasion programs within tumor-colonized tissue. Compared with CRC2631, iSTORM increases intratumoral CD8+ T cells, shifts T-cell state toward activation with reduced exhaustion-prone features, strengthens antigen-presentation programs, and achieves deeper tumor control. A lyophilized formulation preserves immune remodeling while improving deployability. Mechanistically, glycan arrays and functional studies support mannose-rich glycan-guided tumor engagement. iSTORM toxicity studies, including systemic cytokine, hematologic, blood chemistry, and lethality demonstrate a favorable safety profile. Collectively, these findings establish iSTORM as a safe, programmable, CMTM6-silencing microbial immunotherapy platform that selectively targets and penetrate PDAC tumors to unleash anti-tumor immune activities.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Interferon Beta Drives Therapy Resistance in a Patient Derived Model of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Conant, A., Suzuki, T., +9 authors, Unternaehrer, J. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer cell-autonomous type 1 interferon (IFN-1) production and signaling is frequently activated in response to DNA damage and has been associated with the development of therapy resistance in several cancer types. However, its cell-autonomous role in driving resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), a disease defined by near-universal exposure to genotoxic therapy as frontline treatment, remains unclear. Specifically, whether IFN-1 functions in HGSOC as only a response to genotoxic stress or can independently act in driving resistance phenotypes has not been studied. Utilizing a syngeneic patient-derived model of cisplatin-sensitive (SE) and -resistant (CR) HGSOC, we demonstrate that chronic cisplatin exposure is associated with enrichment of IFN-1 signaling and the interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS). Acute cisplatin treatment elicited dynamic, temporal IFN-1 signaling and responses in both sensitive and resistant cells, indicating a conserved stress response in resistant cells. Chronic, low-level exposure to exogenous IFN{beta}, in the absence of a DNA-damaging agent, was sufficient to phenocopy several features of chronic cisplatin driven resistance, including reduced therapeutic sensitivity, cell cycle arrest, and decreased proliferation. Notably, IFN{beta} driven resistance occurred without sustained IRDS or canonical interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, revealing alternative mechanisms for IFN-1 mediated therapy resistance. Together, these findings identify IFN{beta} as a functional driver of the development of resistance-associated phenotypes and highlight cell-autonomous IFN-1 signaling as a potential biomarker for resistance and a therapeutic target in platinum-resistant disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">tRF-3021a, a tRNA-Ala-TGC derived 3' fragment, promotes glioblastoma cell invasion, suppresses apoptosis, and is required for normal levels of protein synthesis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Esmaeili, F., Bannerjee, K., +6 authors, Dutta, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are relatively recently discovered class of small RNAs implicated in gene-regulatory processes in diverse biological contexts but there have been very few reports of a clear phenotypic role of these small RNAs in cancer progression. By analyzing small RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found that high expression of three 3' tRFs (tRF-3a), tRF-3009a, tRF-3021a or tRF-3030a, is significantly associated with poor overall survival in low-grade glioma (LGG). In glioblastoma cells, tRF-3009a, tRF-3021a and tRF-3030a enhance cell invasion and migration but tRF-3021a was uniquely required for cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Interestingly, tRF-3021a knockdown decreases global protein synthesis prior to and independent of apoptosis. These data indicate that tRF-3021a supports glioma cell survival and particularly protein synthesis while promoting cellular invasion and migration. Given its association with poor outcome in LGG patients, tRF-3021a represents a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target in gliomas and these results provide a foundation for future studies to define its molecular interactors and downstream pathways controlling protein synthesis and apoptosis in cancer cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Drug repurposing to combat multidrug-resistant hookworm.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">McKean EL, Jackson CA, +1 author, Hawdon JM, O'Halloran DM.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Anthelmintic resistance (AR) poses an escalating threat to global soil-transmitted helminth control efforts, particularly in the context of mass drug administration (MDA) programs that rely heavily on benzimidazole drugs. To address the urgent need for novel therapeutics, a machine learning (ML) guided drug repurposing pipeline was developed to identify compounds effective against a multi-anthelmintic drug-resistant (MADR) isolate of Ancylostoma caninum. The computational strategy employed in this work involved training classifiers on curated datasets of anthelmintic actives and decoys, followed by screening all approved drugs from the online database, DrugBank. Selected compounds were tested using a tiered assay system comprising egg hatch assays (EHA), larval development assays (LDA), and adult survival assays. Among these, flutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen approved for prostate cancer, demonstrated potent, egg- and larval-stage-specific activity against MADR hookworm. Flutamide exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of egg hatching and arrested larval development in MADR hookworm. These findings underscore the translational value of drug repurposing to accelerate therapeutic discovery against MADR helminths.</p>
