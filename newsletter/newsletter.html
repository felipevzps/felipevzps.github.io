<h2 class="paper-title">Anti-CD206 CAR T Cell Treatment Restores Fibrosis-Induced Loss of Dermal White Adipose Tissue</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Park, C., Mohamed, A. O., +9 authors, Pioli, P. A.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fibrosis drives pathology in the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc), which has the highest case fatality rate of any systemic autoimmune disease with no validated biomarkers or curative treatments. Our prior work has shown that CD206+ macrophages and dermal fibroblasts engage in cooperative mechanisms of inflammatory and fibrotic activation in SSc. Here, we designed a targeted immunotherapeutic approach to eliminate CD206+ macrophages using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. We demonstrate that systemic delivery of a single dose of anti-CD206 CAR T cells restores dermal white adipose tissue (DWAT) in vivo. Notably, loss of subcutaneous fat is a well-recognized but poorly understood aspect of SSc pathogenesis that precedes the development of fibrosis and is driven by changes in lineage commitment of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Using snRNA-seq and a newly-developed in vitro co-culture model, we report that CD206high macrophages mediate ADSC shift from adipocytic to fibrotic activation in part through an IL-6-dependent mechanism. This report implicates a novel function for macrophages in the regulation of early SSc pathogenesis and is the first to establish the therapeutic efficacy of using CAR T cell immunotherapy to target macrophages in the treatment of SSc skin disease.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Pharmacophore-driven antibody discovery on the yeast surface</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Huang, M., Williams, S. J., +2 authors, Van Deventer, J. A.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-small molecule hybrids are structures capable of combining the inhibitory properties of small molecules and the specificities of binding proteins. However, discovery of such synergistic conjugates is a substantial engineering challenge. Here, we describe pharmacophore-driven antibody discovery as a high throughput approach to hybrid discovery. In this approach, we use a yeast display antibody library containing reactive noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) and further diversify it by conjugating the library to four sulfonamide pharmacophores. Yeast display binding screens with each of the resulting billion-member hybrid collections against bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) yielded diverse collections of hybrids. Individual hybrids exhibited double digit nanomolar binding affinities, and frequently exhibited inhibitory properties in solution, despite the fact that the screens were based solely on binding phenotypes. Deep sequencing of sorted populations revealed that enrichments were strongly pharmacophore-dependent. In particular, screens with a potent pharmacophore led to collections of hybrids varying substantially in pharmacophore attachment point and antibody sequence features, while screens with moderate or weak pharmacophores led to collections with much narrower sets of enriched attachment points and antibody sequence features. Identification of the most frequently isolated CDR-H3 sequences and clustering CDR-H3 sequences by similarity within enriched populations provided further evidence for pharmacophore-dependent sorting outcomes. Experimental binding assays in which the pharmacophore warhead used during screening was replaced by another warhead indicated that isolated clones can tolerate alternative pharmacophores, but tend to prefer the warhead used during screening. Overall, these efforts demonstrate the utility of introducing pharmacophores into antibody libraries along with several lines of evidence that screening outcomes are pharmacophore-driven. These findings advance our understanding of hybrid discovery and highlight opportunities to pursue hybrids as research tools and potential therapeutic leads.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During gestation, the human placenta develops as a fetal organ in direct contact with maternal cells and tissues. Most pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, have their roots early in pregnancy, most probably in dysregulation of placental development and/or disturbances in the interaction with maternal (immune) cells. Here, we applied an integrative analysis of open-access gene expression data on the human placenta, comparing expression levels between the first and second trimesters of healthy pregnancy, with a focus on differentially expressed genes related to immune processes. The holistic approach of our study revealed differentially expressed genes involved in the recognition and elimination of potential PAMPs and DAMPs, transendothelial cell migration, cytokine production, transplacental IgG transport, and maintenance of immune tolerance during the transition from the first to the second trimester of placental development. Most DEGs show an increased expression. Only a few genes, DEFB1, SLPI, and LCN2, which encode antimicrobial proteins, homeostatic chemokines, and a pleiotropic PAEP that maintains tolerance, display maximal expression in the first trimester, followed by further down-regulation. The cell types deconvolutions revealed the thypical representation of placental cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">iss-nf: A Nextflow-based end-to-end in situ sequencing decoding workflow</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vakili, N., Gonzalez-Tirado, S., +7 authors, Vale-Silva, L. A.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In situ sequencing (ISS) offers a powerful approach for spatially resolved gene expression profiling within tissue samples, but the complexity of analyzing the resulting data has limited its broader use. Here, we present iss-nf, a Nextflow-based, end-to-end workflow designed to streamline the decoding of large ISS datasets. The workflow automates critical steps, including image registration, fluorescent spot detection, transcript decoding, and quality control (QC), offering a scalable, reproducible, and user-friendly solution for ISS data analysis. We successfully applied iss-nf on multiple large datasets, including publicly available mouse brain and breast cancer tissue datasets, as well as an in-house non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ISS dataset. The workflow is designed to be accessible for both experienced researchers, as well as newcomers to spatial transcriptomics, providing a robust tool for analyzing large-scale ISS data. Our results suggest that iss-nf is a valuable contribution to the growing field of spatial transcriptomics, enabling precise, modular, reproducible, and, by means of automated tiling and parallelization, scalable analysis of tissue-specific gene expression.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Assembly and cell-free expression of a partial genome for the synthetic cell</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Cleij, C. V., Sierra Heras, L., +4 authors, Danelon, C.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The de novo design and assembly of a DNA genome represents an important milestone toward the construction of a minimal synthetic cell. The genome must contain all the instructions to enable primary cellular functions, probably comprising over 150 genes with a total size over 200 kb. Here, we designed and built a partial synthetic genome that satisfies the requirements for its expression in PURE system--a minimal transcription-translation machinery reconstituted from purified elements--and its replication by the protein-primed {varphi}29 DNA replication system. The partial minimal synthetic genome (MSG) has a size of 41 kb, was assembled in yeast from 14 fragments, and harbors genes for phospholipid biosynthesis, DNA replication, and cell division. Yeast marker fragments were added between coding fragments to facilitate screening of correct assemblies and a BAC backbone was included to enable transfer from yeast to E. coli for amplification. Synthesis of all MSG-encoded proteins in PURE system was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and fluorescence measurements. Moreover, we demonstrate successful compartmentalization and expression of the MSG in liposomes, as well as full-length replication of the linearized MSG by the {varphi}29 DNA replication machinery. This work provides proof-of-concept for the bottom-up assembly and cell-free expression of a functional genome for a minimal synthetic cell.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CTDP: Identifying cell types associated with disease phenotypes using scRNA-seq data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, C., Zhou, M., +8 authors, Yuan, L.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing enables transcriptome-wide analysis at single-cell resolution, offering unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity across biological conditions. However, accurately comparing transcriptomic distributions of cells from distinct biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, remains challenging. To address this, we developed CTDP, a robust and interpretable computational framework that identifies disease phenotype-associated cell types of interest by integrating Lasso-regularized logistic regression with permutation testing. Through comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets, including melanoma immunotherapy, COVID-19 severity, and liver cirrhosis, CTDP consistently outperformed existing methods such as DA-seq, scDist, and PENCIL in both accuracy and robustness. In melanoma, CTDP uncovered immune-responsive clusters and revealed transcriptional regulators like PTPRC, CREM, and JUNB linked to immunotherapy efficacy. In COVID-19, it identified critical severity-associated cell types, such as B cells, NK cells, epithelial cells, and macrophages, which contribute to dysregulated immune responses and inflammation in severe cases. These results highlight CTDP's power in uncovering disease-relevant cell populations and its potential to advance precision medicine through single-cell analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">cgDist: An Enhanced Algorithm for Efficient Calculation of pairwise SNP and InDel differences from Core Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">de Ruvo, A., Castelli, P., +5 authors, Di Pasquale, A.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bacterial genomic surveillance requires balancing computational efficiency with genetic resolution for effective outbreak investigation. Traditional cgMLST distance calculations treat all allelic differences as equivalent units, potentially obscuring nucleotide-level variation critical for source attribution. While SNP-based methods provide enhanced resolution, their computational requirements limit routine deployment in surveillance laboratories. We present cgDist, an algorithm that bridges this resolution gap by calculating nucleotide-level distances directly from cgMLST allelic profiles. The unified cache architecture stores comprehensive alignment statistics, enabling multiple distance calculation modes without redundant computation and supporting both dataset-specific and schema-complete cache generation. This design transforms genomic surveillance from batch processing to continuous streaming analysis, with cumulative performance benefits as laboratories accumulate alignment data. cgDist functions optimally as a precision "zoom lens" for the detailed investigation of clusters identified through initial cgMLST screening. Rather than restructuring entire population relationships, this targeted approach maximizes epidemiological insight precisely where enhanced resolution is most valuable. The algorithm ensures that cgDist distances are always greater than or equal to corresponding cgMLST distances, preserving epidemiological interpretability while adding critical genetic discrimination. The system includes integrated recombination detection capabilities that leverage cached alignment statistics to identify potential horizontal gene transfer events through mutation density analysis. This multi-scale analytical framework - from population screening through cluster zoom analysis to recombination detection - provides comprehensive surveillance capabilities within the computational constraints of routine public health practice.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in high-resolution Hi-C and Micro-C technologies have enabled finer-scale characterization of 3D genome architecture, but they also introduce substantial computational challenges, as the size of dense contact matrices scales quadratically with resolution, resulting in prohibitive memory demands. To address this, we developed BandHiC, a memory-efficient and user-friendly Python package for organizing and analyzing Hi-C matrices down to sub-kilobase resolution. BandHiC adopts a banded storage strategy that preserves only a configurable diagonal bandwidth of the dense contact matrix, reducing memory usage by up to 99% while maintaining fast random access and intuitive indexing operations. In addition, it provides flexible masking mechanisms to handle missing values, outliers, and unmappable regions, and supports efficient vectorized operations optimized with NumPy, thereby enabling scalable analysis of ultra-high-resolution Hi-C datasets.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Robust prediction of drug combination side effects in realistic settings</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jimenez, R., Paccanaro, A.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Side effects caused by drug combinations pose a major challenge in healthcare. Knowledge of these side effects is limited because often they are not detected in clinical trials, which typically involve a restricted number of participants and tested drug combinations. We introduce DCSE (Drug Combinations Side Effects), a novel machine learning method for predicting polypharmacy side effects. DCSE learns latent signatures for drugs, drug pairs, and side effects to predict the probability that a side effect occurs in a given drug combination. We first evaluate its performance in the commonly adopted experimental settings in the literature. Then, a key contribution of this paper is the introduction of more realistic experimental settings that incorporate warm-start and cold-start scenarios under a prospective evaluation. Here, we attempt to predict side effects reported between 2009 and 2014 after training only on data available prior to that period. Our results indicate that DCSE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in real-world applications.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer shows aberrant alternative splicing (AS), which could functionally perturb proteins required for normal cellular behavior. Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene transcription. Some evidence about AS-driven perturbation of TFs in cancer has been documented. A comprehensive systematic analysis of how cancer-specific AS could affect functions of TFs is missing. Such an analysis could reveal the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression due to transcription misregulations, and thus could help identify therapeutic targets. Here, we systematically analyzed potential functional perturbations of TFs due to AS across 15 cancer types. By analyzing AS patterns, we identified 2 118 perturbed AS events (i.e., events showing significant AS pattern differences between normal and paired cancer samples) that affect 718 TFs across 14 cancer types. In 189 TFs, the perturbed AS events affected known functional domains of TFs. Indirect evidence for the functional impact of cancer-specific AS on TFs were also found: First, by relating AS patterns of the perturbed AS events with the DNA-binding and regulatory activity of TFs. Second, by using cancer dependency data to explore whether the affected TFs are essential for cancer cell line proliferation. Our findings show a large-scale functional perturbation of TFs due to cancer-specific AS.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Endometrial cancer is one of the main gynecological malignancies worldwide, with an estimated 320, 000 new cases annually. Several studies highlight ARHGAP35 as a significantly mutated gene in these tumors. It encodes for the protein p190RhoGAP-A (p190A), which is a major regulator of the small GTPase family of proteins. ARHGAP5 is a paralog of ARHGAP35 that encodes the protein p190RhoGAP-B (p190B). By analyzing human endometrial cancer samples, we found a co-occurrence of mutations in ARHGAP35 and ARHGAP5 genes and we reported that both are less expressed at the mRNA level in tumoral samples compared to healthy tissues. We were interested in understanding the impact of p190A/B under-expression in endometrial cancer and the relationship between the two paralogs. To do so, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate HEC-1-A knockout cells for p190A and p190B. We showed that removal of each paralog led to a similar actin remodeling phenotype with the formation of Cross-Linked Actin Networks (CLANs), dependent on the Rho/ROCK pathway. Moreover, proteomic analysis of p190A and p190B knockout cells highlighted similar affected cell functions. Finally, our study demonstrates a synthetic lethality between p190A and p190B where removal of both paralogs is deleterious in endometrial cancer cells, unveiling a potential actionable vulnerability.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is the main cancer-related mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH). NHL genetic and molecular classifications have been intensely studied and correlated with clinical outcomes, but critical unanswered questions relevant to malignancy persist. For example, tumors positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are aggressive and account for 30-50% of HIV-associated NHLs, yet insights on the nature of EBV in NHL pathogenesis or potential therapeutic vulnerabilities have been limited. Here, we examined HIV-associated NHLs stratified by histopathologic classification, cell of origin (COO), molecular subtype, and EBV status using genome-wide spatial transcriptomic analyses. Tumor tissues in EBV+ HIV-NHLs displayed enriched expression of mitochondrial respiration and purine metabolism signatures versus EBV- tumors. Immune infiltration of EBV+ tumors was limited, and immune and stromal regions of EBV+ HIV-NHLs displayed upregulation of the gene for the iron exporter ferroportin (SLC40A1), indicating immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. An immunosuppressive SPP1-CD44 axis and oncogenic GAS6-AXL interaction between tumor and stroma were specifically predicted for EBV+ HIV-NHLs with plasmablastic features. Tumor microenvironment (TME) similarities to secondary lymphoid tissues such as inverse CXCL12-CXCL13 gradients and evidence of matching between tumor B cell phenotypes and reticular cell signatures were also observed. Finally, we developed a simple yet flexible approach to quantify expression gradients and cell proximity to annotated regions. Thus, this study highlights potential avenues for NHL therapy tailored by EBV status and provides a unique resource to examine tumor-TME interactions in the HIV-immunocompromised context.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ OPSCC) is now the leading HPV+ cancer in the United States and United Kingdom. Despite high cure rates, a significant subset of patients have aggressive HPV+ OPSCC that recurs; deciphering the underlying mechanisms will identify biomarkers that delineate patient subgroups for personalized treatment. In a comprehensive investigation using complementary clinically-relevant models of HPV+ OPSCC, we demonstrated that elevated expression of a HPV16 E6 spliced isoform (E6*I) compared to full-length E6 (E6FL), is critical for aggressive invasion. Introduction of splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to inhibit E6FL splicing, effectively mitigated invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that aggressive invasion occurs via E6*I-induced endocytosis of E-cadherin (ECAD) from the cell membrane, consistent with partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). The clinical relevance of this mechanism was validated in patient cohorts where a reduced ratio of E6FL to all E6 splice variants was associated with high p-EMT signature, lower membrane:cell ECAD, and worse recurrence-free survival. Together, our findings show that low membrane:cell ECAD ratio in pre-treatment biopsies of HPV+ OPSCC, could stratify patients according to risk; patients with a low ratio may not be candidates for treatment de-intensification trials. Importantly, since ECAD detection is by immunohistochemistry, which is widely used even in diagnostic pathology laboratories with limited resources, membrane:cell ECAD ratio could be a clinically scalable biomarker. Targeting E6FL splicing with SSOs should be explored further as a logical strategy for therapeutic intervention in patients with HPV+ OPSCC.</p>

<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Young women with breast cancer (YBC, age[≤]40) are particularly prevalent in Asian. YBCs usually show more aggressive pathology and poorer outcomes than non-young patients. However, YBCs are underrepresented in current BC risk models, with their tumor intrinsic subtypes and microenvironments lacking a systematic elucidation at the single-cell level, thereby limiting the young-specific therapies. We established a single-cell Chinese YBC landscape baseline, including 246,659 cells, by applying scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on untreated patients. We developed a cross-modal feature selection algorithm to construct a young-intrinsic subtype classifier BCYtype, outperforming existing classifiers in pseudobulk, cellular, and external cohorts. Comparative analyses with non-young samples revealed a direct differentiation trajectory from mammary stem cells to mature luminal cells. Pseudotemporal analysis also demonstrated that tumor cells in younger patients undergo earlier carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that CDH1 interacts with pTex and NKT cells, serving as a young-specific marker and a potential therapeutic target for HR+ young patients. The interaction between exhausted T cells and antigen-presenting cells revealed NKG2A as a candidate therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer in young patients.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Self-Supervised AI Reveals a Hidden Landscape of Prognostic Spatial Patterns in Multiplex Immunofluorescence Images</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Farndale, L., Rakovic, K., +15 authors, Yuan, K.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Modern spatial proteomic methods, such as multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging, offer a data-rich view of spatial biology in intact tissues. However, interpreting its complexity is a major bottleneck, limiting its potential for biological discovery and clinical translation. Current computational methods often rely on segmentation-based approaches that discard crucial morphological information and are limited to testing pre-defined hypotheses. Here, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that enables hypothesis-agnostic, context-aware discovery of biomarkers directly from mIF images. Our approach extracts rich feature representations that capture holistic architectural patterns, which integrate cellular morphology, marker interactions, and microenvironmental context without human supervision. Applying this framework to over 7,000 mIF tissue images from over 1,800 patients in two distinct cancer types, we demonstrate superior prognostic performance over conventional segmentation analyses. The method autonomously identified previously unknown and potentially clinically actionable biological patterns. In lung adenocarcinoma, these include a Ki67-mediated immune evasion phenotype, a subcellular pattern of GLB1 expression which aligns with low-grade EGFR-driven tumours, and distinct modes of tumour-immune interaction in PD-L1+ patients. We also find a regulatory T-cell-mediated immunosupressive environment promoting tumour budding in colorectal carcinoma. Our work establishes SSL as a powerful, scalable, and unbiased platform to decode tissue ecosystems while being fully explainable without pre-defined hypotheses. This paradigm shift transforms high-plex imaging from a hypothesis-testing tool into a hypothesis-generating engine that can accelerate the discovery of next-generation spatial biomarkers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A Druggable Tumor Suppressor and Leukemic Stem Cell Marker</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pan, Y., Wang, C., +5 authors, Kang, X.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often enters remission after chemotherapy but frequently relapses due to chemotherapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Relapsed AML remains largely unresponsive to current therapies and carries a poor prognosis. We developed a large-language model (LLM) agent that incorporates multi-modal data to nominate druggable therapeutic targets for AML. We identified that higher expression of AGTR2 (encoding AT2R) is associated with better chemotherapy response and longer survival. In functional studies of 68 primary human AML samples, we found that LSCs consistently lacked AT2R expression. Across both CD34-expressing and -non-expressing AML samples, AT2R expression positively correlated with CD34 and CD117 expression. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using 21 primary AML samples, AT2R- cells initiated leukemia, whereas AT2R+ cells failed to do so. AT2R- cells gave rise to both AT2R+ and AT2R- progeny, suggesting hierarchical differentiation. Following chemotherapy in AML PDX mice, bone marrow analysis showed a marked enrichment of AT2R- cells and depletion of AT2R+ cells, indicating that AT2R- cells drive minimal residual disease and relapse. These results support the role of AT2R absence as a marker of LSCs. We observed reduced AT2R expression in AML cells compared to healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Whole-genome sequencing of AML patients revealed no functional mutations in AGTR2. However, 3D chromatin and epigenetic analyses uncovered frequent chromatin rearrangements involving AGTR2 promoter-silencer interactions, indicating epigenetic silencing as a likely mechanism for AT2R downregulation in AML. To validate the tumor suppressor role of AT2R, we developed murine AML models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a fusions with either Agtr2 knockdown or enforced expression. Agtr2 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis, while enforced Agtr2 expression delayed AML progression. In these models, enforced Agtr2 expression reduced LSC frequency, impaired cell cycle progression, and decreased AML stemness, as confirmed by limiting dilution assays and analysis of LSC-enriched populations. Mechanistically, enforced Agtr2 expression suppressed fatty acid metabolism - a key driver of AML stemness and growth - and inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including GSK3, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/b-catenin. This led to reduced SREBF1 activity, confirmed by protein level changes and CUT&amp;Tag assays. We tested buloxibutid (C21), a small-molecule AT2R agonist currently in phase II trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in AML PDX models derived from 20 de novo and 6 relapsed AML samples. C21 significantly inhibited AML progression and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly in relapsed AML models.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Kong, Z., Wang, Y., +4 authors, Wang, J.</p>
<p class="paper-tldr"><strong>tl;dr:</strong> </p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the clinical success of cancer immunotherapies, their efficacy is often compromised by antigen-related problems, including heterogeneity, downregulation, loss, and off-tumor toxicity. To overcome these limitations that challenge the current immunotherapies dependent on native antigens, we here describe a new cancer immunotherapy strategy, which artificially and specifically expresses a clinical validated antigen on variant tumors and thus repurposes clinical antibody drugs to treat cancers not belonging to their indications. To authenticate the strategy, we delivered a CD20 gene under a control of NF-{kappa}B-specific promoter to tumors by adeno-associated virus and then treated them with a CD20 antibody, rituximab. We found that CD20 was selectively expressed in tumors and the followed rituximab treatment activated natural killer (NK) cell to kill cancer cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that this strategy is effective not only in variant cultivated cancer cells, HCT116 spheroids, and patient-derived organoids of human colorectal cancer, but also in humanized mouse with HCT116 xenograft and immunocompetent mouse with CT26 transplant. The strategy showed high cancer cell specificity in both in vitro and in vivo treatments, leading to high security in animal treatments. This strategy thus creates a new modality of cancer immune-redirection therapy by repurposing the clinical validated both antigen and antibody.</p>
