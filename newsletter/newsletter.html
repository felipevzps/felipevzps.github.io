<h2 class="paper-title">Hierarchical Deep Learning Framework Integrating Structural Interaction Potentials and Evolutionary Information for Protein-Protein Interaction Affinity Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ibrahim, A., Hassan, M., Ali, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to cellular biology, making accurate prediction of protein-protein interaction affinity (PPIA) crucial for drug discovery and disease mechanism elucidation. Existing computational methods often lack explicit physical constraints or operate as "black boxes," hindering interpretability and generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce StructFuncNet, a novel hierarchical deep learning framework designed for highly accurate, generalizable, and interpretable PPIA prediction. Our approach uniquely integrates multi-level Structural Interaction Potentials (SIP) with rich evolutionary information and advanced graph neural networks (GNNs). This dual paradigm leverages SIP for physical and geometric realism, while GNNs and Transformer-like components learn synergistic dynamics and contextual corrections. StructFuncNet incorporates comprehensive input feature categories, including pre-trained protein residue features, SIP interface energies, evolutionary conservation scores, global molecular descriptors, and interface interaction counts. We extensively evaluated StructFuncNet on diverse and challenging benchmarks, including those for mutation affinity, multi-domain complexes, and intrinsically disordered proteins, as well as complexes derived from predicted structures. Our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating high correlations across all tested scenarios. Furthermore, StructFuncNet proves robust on complexes derived from predicted structures. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic contributions of our multi-modal features and architectural components, underscoring StructFuncNet's capacity to provide a robust, interpretable, and efficient solution for complex PPIA prediction challenges.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">uSort-M: Scalable isolation of user-defined sequences from diverse pooled libraries</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Olivas, M. B., Almhjell, P. J., +1 author, Fordyce, P. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-throughput sequencing and computational protein design have created a growing gap between the discovery of new proteins and their functional characterization. In many instances, functional characterization requires one-to-one measurements--such as when detailed biochemical insights are desired or pooled selections are not possible--necessitating that individual variants be isolated and assayed. A major barrier to closing this gap is the cost to directly synthesize individual genes, which remains prohibitively expensive ($10-100 per sequence) and restricts these studies to small subsets of relevant variants, leaving many sequences without functional annotation. To address this, we developed user-defined Sorted Mutants (uSort-M), which combines pooled DNA synthesis, automated cell sorting of transformed Escherichia coli, and long-read sequencing to rapidly isolate and identify variants from diverse libraries. uSort-M can isolate, sequence, and validate individual variants from pooled libraries produced via diverse existing methods including multiplex assembly, error-prone PCR, or pooled QuickChange mutagenesis. Sorting single bacterial clones into 384-well plates is efficient: eight plates (3,072 wells) can be filled in 1-2 hours, with up to 90% of wells yielding monoclonal cultures. Commercial long-read sequencing enables accessible, fast, and cost-effective identification of individual sequences from isolated clones while tolerating wide variation in fragment length and diversity across the library. Applying this workflow to a 328-member scanning mutagenesis library of a 300-bp gene recovered 96% of desired variants at fivefold lower cost than traditional synthesis. Numerical simulations identify key parameters governing library recovery and enable accurate prediction of the sampling effort required to achieve target coverage. As library size increases, this workflow offers substantial savings over traditional gene synthesis or cloning. Due to its generalizability, efficiency, and reliance on standard instrumentation, uSort-M removes a key barrier to large-scale protein functional characterization.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Machine Learning enables efficient and effective affinity maturation of nanobodies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Paul, S. B., Harvey, E. P., +14 authors, Kruse, A. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibodies can bind their targets with exquisite potency and selectivity due in part to large antibody-target protein-protein interaction surface areas. Despite the very large size and diversity of synthetic libraries, in vitro sorting alone tends to yield binders with modest affinities. By analogy to the in vivo affinity maturation in the natural immune system, these initial hits are typically affinity matured in vitro to achieve high affinity binding. However, affinity maturation campaigns can be laborious, often requiring multiple selection rounds and strategies for each clone to be optimized. Here, we investigated whether one could accelerate the discovery of optimized binders using machine learning on sequencing data from single selection sorts of affinity maturation yeast-display campaigns. Our results show that sparse sequencing data from a single sorting round can predict sequences that are enriched after multiple rounds. We also find that linear models outperform deep neural networks and semi-supervised approaches in ranking validated affinity-enhancing substitutions. Linear models are also more interpretable, offering insights into residue preferences that can be leveraged for further engineering. We use our models to design and select optimized nanobody binders to relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), yielding multiple improved binders including 3 sub nanomolar binders with the best exhibiting a ~2500-fold improvement over WT.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Designing AAV Capsid Protein with viability-guided Diffusion Model</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xiao, S., Zeng, X., +4 authors, Peng, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have shown great promise as delivery vectors for gene therapy. However, the natural properties of AAV capsids impose significant limitations on their efficacy. While capsid library screening and directed evolution have facilitated the development of improved vectors, current methods for generating AAV libraries frequently yield nonviable variants that fail to assemble or package DNA. Here, we propose a viability-guided diffusion model AAVDiffusion for de novo viable AAV capsid design. AAVDiffusion iteratively denoises Gaussian vectors into vectors of AAV capsid protein sequences, yielding intermediate latent variables. By leveraging the continuous nature of these latent variables, AAVDiffusion integrates an additional viability classifier that applies gradient updates to enhance the generation of viable AAV sequences. Through extensive computational tests, AAVDiffusion exhibits superior performance in generating viable AAV sequences. Furthermore, 196 AAV candidates were identified through a selection workflow, with the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby offering safer and more effective gene therapies for brain diseases. AAVDiffusion offers a powerful and efficient computational method for designing viable AAV capsids, advancing the development of AAV vectors for gene therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bayesian Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks at Stochastic Steady State</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gupta, A., Yoon, R., Josic, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) form the regulatory backbone that coordinates gene expression. The architecture of GRNs shapes their function and constraints the biochemical pathways through which information flows. Inferring the structure of regulatory interactions is thus essential for understanding biological systems, and designing targeted therapies. Despite substantial progress in GRN inference, most approaches -- from statistical methods to deep learning -- do not take into account fundamental biochemical processes that drive regulatory dynamics. To address this shortcoming, here we present a novel Bayesian inference approach based on using the Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE) as a model of gene expression dynamics at stochastic equilibrium. Interactions in GRNs are sparse, and we thus use a regularized horseshoe prior enabling selective shrinkage of unsupported interactions while identifying strong regulatory edges. We evaluate our method using synthetic gene expression data, allowing for benchmarking against a known ground truth. Our approach allows us to infer kinetic parameters, identify network structure, and infer regulatory cycles without the need to observe transient dynamics. This Bayesian alternative to current methods thus provides both biological interpretability and structural identifiability in GRN inference.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identifying Fundamental Gaps in Functional Metagenomics: A StepTowards Unlocking Microbiome Research Potential</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tiwari, S. K., Telatin, A., Singh, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Incomplete functional annotation systematically limits biological interpretation in microbiome studies and their translational potential. Poor annotation arises from multiple causes, with incomplete gene-protein-reaction mapping being one tractable yet under-examined contributor. We address this gap by developing a comprehensive hierarchical framework that systematically integrates gene families in UniRef, proteins in UniProt, and metabolic reactions in BioCyc, mapping 76% of reactions (432,510 of 562,869 reactions in BioCyc across 21,244 organisms) to the encoding gene families using EC and Pfam domain-based strategies. To demonstrate how database mapping choices impact metagenomics studies, we applied our framework to human gut metagenome dataset using HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN) and compared outcomes with HUMAnN's default database mapping approach. Our GPR mapping increased detectable metabolic reactions by 28-fold and significantly increased the data prevalence across samples (from 35% to 80% core reactions). This directly addresses the problem of data sparsity, a critical barrier to statistical and machine learning applications. These gains derive from systematic database integration alone, without predictive algorithms, demonstrating that substantial functional dark matter and data sparsity problems in microbiome studies arises from methodological artifacts that are directly addressable.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">quantms-rescoring enables deep proteome coverage across protein quantification, immunopeptidomics, and post-translational modifications experiments.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dai, C., Gabriels, R., +10 authors, Perez-Riverol, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The growing volume of public proteomics datasets and the advent of novel machine learning (ML)-based methods create unprecedented opportunities for discovery through large-scale reanalysis. However, traditional desktop tools are increasingly insufficient for processing and integrating data at this scale. To address this challenge, we present a novel package, quantms-rescoring, that extends the cloud-native quantms workflow with a machine learning-based rescoring module. Unlike prior tools that rescore single-engine outputs, quantms-rescoring seamlessly integrates multiple search engines (SAGE, COMET, and MSGF+), performs automatic model selection, model fine-tuning, and scales reproducibly on cloud infrastructures. In quantms-rescoring, we rely on multiple fragment-ion intensity (AlphaPeptDeep and MS2PIP) and retention-time prediction (DeepLC) methods to improve results from multiple peptide database search engines. It features automatic model selection, fine-tuning, and retraining for MS/MS intensity and retention time prediction to select the best model for a given dataset. We applied the novel workflow to five representative datasets spanning DDA label-free quantification, TMT 10-plex isobaric labelling of tumor proteomics data, immunopeptidomics, phospho-proteomics, and unseen lysine malonylation experiments. We achieved a 16-22.8% increase in identified spectra, along with the quantification of 2191 additional phosphorylated peptides and 1337 phosphosites. In the tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled clear cell renal cell carcinoma dataset, 76 novel differentially expressed multiple search engines identified proteins with quantms-rescoring. Additionally, novel 11,688 HLA-II potential binders were detected in the immunopeptidomics dataset by multiple search engines with quantms-rescoring. For unseen malonylation data, we reported more than 58.8% malonylation PSMs and 30.5% modification sites than COMET alone. Together, these results show that integrating multi-engine searches with machine learning-derived features can be combined in a scalable workflow that enhances identification, PTM localization, and quantification performance.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Towards automated gating of clinical flow cytometry data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Martini, P., Mohammadi, M., +2 authors, Krause, S. W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Flow cytometry analysis is widespread practice in cell biology, immunology and hematology. Cell populations of interest are typically identified by consecutively examining the expression levels of protein marker pairs. Since this manual gating process lacks standardization and is time-consuming, several machine learning (ML) methods for the automated gating of flow cytometry data have been proposed in recent years. We evaluated state-of-the-art ML methods for automated gating based on three criteria: gating performance in comparison to manual expert annotations, interpretability of the output, and feasibility of deployment in a clinical setting. Based on these criteria, we selected the top-performing methods and made them easily accessible in the Python package FLAG-X ("FLow cytometry Automated Gating toolboX"), which further features a novel hybrid workflow that interlocks manual and automated gating and integrates seamlessly with standard software for manual gating procedure. To demonstrate its practical utility, we applied FLAG-X to representative cases from routine clinical practice. FLAG-X is available at https://anaconda.org/channels/bioconda/packages/flagx/overview.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Lactate-Driven Heterogeneity of Immune Checkpoint Expression in Breast and Lung Cancer Cell Lines</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">San-Millan, I., Martinez, J., +3 authors, Brooks, G. A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tumor-derived lactate is increasingly recognized as an immunosuppressive metabolite within the tumor microenvironment (TME), with emerging evidence highlighting its role beyond metabolism to include epigenetic and immune regulatory functions. While prior studies have primarily focused on individual immune checkpoints, most prominently PD-L1, it remains unclear whether lactate broadly coordinates the expression of multiple immune regulatory pathways across distinct tumor types, particularly in the context of chronic exposure mimicking glycolytic tumors. Here, we investigated the relationship between lactate-producing metabolism and immune checkpoint gene expression in four human cancer cell lines representing breast and lung cancer: MCF7 (estrogen receptor-positive breast), MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast), A549 (non-small cell lung), and H82 (small cell lung). By manipulating glucose availability and exposure duration to model acute (6 h) versus chronic (48 h) lactate production, and by pharmacologically inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with oxamate, we quantified extracellular lactate accumulation and assessed transcriptional responses of a panel of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, CD80, CD73, LGALS9, VISTA, PVR, CD47, FGL1, STING) and lactate-associated genes (MCT1, MCT4, LDHA, HCAR1) via qPCR. Chronic high glucose conditions produced robust, LDH dependent lactate accumulation and were associated with coordinated, lineage specific remodeling of multiple checkpoint transcripts, whereas acute exposure induced minimal changes. MDA MB 231 and A549 cells displayed striking but distinct checkpoint patterns under chronic lactate producing conditions: MDA MB 231 cells showed strong co induction of PD L1 and CD80, while A549 cells exhibited dominant CD80 induction with modest PD L1 upregulation. H82 cells upregulated PD L1 alongside CD73, LGALS9, CD47, and CD80, whereas MCF7 cells demonstrated more modest yet coordinated increases across several checkpoints. Chronic glucose exposure resulted in sustained, LDH-dependent lactate accumulation and coordinated induction of multiple immune checkpoint genes, with distinct lineage-specific patterns, e.g., robust PD-L1/CD80 upregulation in MDA-MB-231 versus CD80 dominance in A549. Unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis revealed that duration of glucose exposure, rather than acute glucose availability, was the primary axis of variation and that MCT4 and HCAR1 clustered with strongly induced checkpoints, consistent with a transcriptional program linking lactate export and sensing to immune regulation. These findings support a model in which lactate acts as an upstream regulator of a broader immune escape program, potentially via mechanisms like lactylation and HCAR1 signaling. This work highlights the limitations of single-checkpoint blockade strategies in solid tumors and underscores the potential of targeting lactate metabolism to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in breast and lung cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">NF1 Loss Remodels Tumor Niches for Immune Evasion</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ibrahim, M., Illa-Bochaca, I., +9 authors, Schober, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genetic and transcriptional alterations in cancer cells shape their interactions with immune and stromal compartments, influencing tumor progression, immune evasion, and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Yet, how these interactions are organized within tumor architecture and linked to clinical outcomes remains unclear. Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated across multiple cancer types. NF1 loss-of-function mutations occur in up to 27% of melanoma cases and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Here, we used spatial multi-omics analysis to uncover 12 meta-niches, each comprising distinctive cell types with distinct characteristics, in human melanoma tissues. We found that niches containing immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages were significantly enriched in NF1 mutant melanoma (NF1Mut) tissues. In contrast, niches containing cytotoxic CD8 T cells were significantly diminished. NF1 loss correlates with increased epidermal growth factor signaling (EGFR) signaling and reduced antigen presentation in tissues with limited CD8 T cell infiltration in both human and mouse melanoma. We demonstrate that EGFR inhibition restores antigen presentation and activates immune responses in a syngeneic Nf1 knockdown model resistant to ICIs. These data, therefore, define functionally distinctive niches enriched in NF1Mut melanoma that likely contribute to their aggressive nature and nominate EGFR signaling as a specific target to reinvigorate ICI responses. We therefore link an understudied genetic driver to specific immune architectures and ultimately therapy resistance and suggest a therapeutic strategy expected to improve treatment outcomes in NF1Mut melanoma patients.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Identification of a Novel miRNA Expression Signature for Lung Adenocarcinoma Using Systematic Machine Learning Optimization</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Agrawal, S., Mitra, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common lung cancer subtype, urgently requires reliable microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers for early detection and therapy. This study introduces a machine learning framework integrating feature stability analysis, precision-recall curves, and resampling strategies to robustly identify miRNA signatures from imbalanced TCGA-LUAD data (564 samples: 519 tumor, 45 normal). We selected 8 stable features (hsa-mir-143, hsa-mir-210, hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-183, hsa-mir-96, hsa-mir-182, hsa-mir-130b, hsa-mir-141) with 100% cross-fold stability via 10-fold cross-validation. A Random Forest classifier yielded excellent training performance (AUC: 1.0000; accuracy: 98%) and good generalization on an independent test set (AUC: 0.8438; accuracy: 75%). Consistent feature importance across folds supports biological relevance over overfitting. The framework mitigates class imbalance, high dimensionality, and distribution shifts, key hurdles in biomarker discovery. These reproducible miRNAs hold promise as non-invasive diagnostic tools, though external validation underscores generalization challenges across cohorts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Interpretable inflammation landscape of circulating immune cells.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Laura Jiménez-Gracia, Davide Maspero, +45 authors, Holger Heyn</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inflammation is a biological phenomenon beneficial for homeostasis, but it is unfavorable if dysregulated. Although major progress has been made in characterizing inflammation in specific diseases, a global, holistic understanding is still elusive. This is particularly intriguing, considering its function for human health and the potential for modern medicine if fully deciphered. In this study, we leveraged advances in single-cell transcriptomics to delineate inflammatory processes of circulating immune cells during infection, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our single-cell atlas of more than 6.5 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 1,047 patients (56% female, 43% male) and 19 diseases allowed us to learn a comprehensive model of inflammation in circulating immune cells. The atlas expands current knowledge of the biology of inflammation of immune-mediated diseases, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, infections and solid tumors and lays the foundation to develop a disease classification framework using unsupervised as well as explainable machine learning. Beyond a disease-centered analysis, we charted altered activity of inflammatory molecules in peripheral blood cells, depicting discriminative inflammation-related genes to further understand mechanisms of inflammation. We present a rich resource for the community and lay the groundwork for learning a classifier for inflammatory diseases, presenting cells in circulation as living biomarkers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">DeepMLP: A Proteomics-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Identifying Mis-Localized Proteins across Pan-Cancer.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Bing Wang, Qilei Lin, +2 authors, Xiaopei Shen</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate protein subcellular localization (PSL) is essential for proteins to perform their biological functions, whereas protein mis-localization can disrupt cellular processes and contribute to various diseases, particularly cancer. Although spatial proteomics technologies have enabled systematic studies of PSL, their high cost and technical complexity limit large-scale analysis of mis-localized proteins (MLPs) in cancer. To address this challenge, we propose DeepMLP, a proteomics-driven deep learning framework that identifies MLPs across cancers using large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. It constructs pathway-aware protein representations via a cross-attention mechanism and, by integrating these representations with dynamic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks through graph attention networks, synergistically enhances the ability to uncover potential cancer MLPs. Benchmarking demonstrated that DeepMLP consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and stability for PSL prediction in normal and tumor conditions. Furthermore, we systematically identified potential MLPs across pan-cancer types and further uncovered a subset of potential mis-localized protein kinases. Functional enrichment analyses of these MLPs revealed their significant involvement in cancer-related metabolic and signaling pathways, highlighting their potential biological relevance in tumorigenesis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">BGC-MAC and BGC-MAP: Attention-Based Models for Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Classification and Product Matching.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kechen Lu, Mengting Li, +6 authors, Wen Jun Xie</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Natural products, synthesized via enzymes encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), represent a major source of therapeutic agents. Accurate BGC annotation is essential to unlocking the vast potential of natural product diversity. However, BGC annotation remains challenging due to our incomplete understanding of the enzymatic logic underlying biosynthesis. Here, we present two deep learning models trained on experimentally validated BGC-natural product pairs to advance BGC annotation. The BGC-multihead attention classifier (BGC-MAC) classifies BGCs by natural product class, outperforming antiSMASH and DeepBGC. The BGC-multihead attention product-matcher (BGC-MAP) associates BGCs with product structures, demonstrating potential to prioritize candidate BGCs given a natural product or to identify potential natural products from a given BGC. Importantly, the models' cross-attention mechanisms enable explainable AI, identifying key protein domains and revealing BGC-substructure relationships in the biosynthesis without requiring prior annotations. Together, BGC-MAC and BGC-MAP establish a data-driven, explainable AI framework that enhances BGC annotation, deepens biosynthetic insight, and accelerates the discovery of new natural products.
