<h2 class="paper-title">A deep learning approach for rational affinity maturation of anti-VEGF nanobodies</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Verdon, G., David, L., de Brevern, A., Behbahani, Y. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanobodies offer several advantages over conventional antibodies due to their lower immunogenicity, enhanced stability, and superior tissue penetration, making them promising candidates for cancer therapy. In this study, we employ deep learning algorithms to design anti-VEGF nanobodies via affinity maturation. Our approach integrates structure-guided mutational modeling and systematic measurement of binding affinity and stability for rational optimization of Complementarity Determining Regions. In addition, we developed a sequence-based melting temperature predictor for nanobodies, ensuring stability of the designed mutants. Our method achieves energy reductions up to -4.92 kcal/mol. Our melting temperature predictor demonstrated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.772. These findings emphasize the potential of computational approaches for nanobody affinity maturation and stability prediction, paving the way for more effective therapeutic designs.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs in skeletal muscle following aerobic and resistance exercise</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Regnier:, K., Beaupre, L. P. R., +3 authors, Gurd, B. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) molecules influence the adaptive response to exercise, but how lncRNA responses differ between endurance and resistance exercise modalities is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to bioinformatically infer the expression of lncRNA in skeletal muscle following acute aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE). We downloaded publicly available RNA-seq data, performed a differential expression analysis, and compared lncRNA expression profiles between different exercise types (AE vs. RE) at three time points: baseline, 1 hour post-exercise, and 4 hours post-exercise. We observed distinct lncRNA profiles between acute AE and RE at different time points, suggesting that lncRNA perform different roles in controlling the response to different exercise modalities in skeletal muscle. Future studies should investigate the specific roles of these lncRNAs in the response to acute exercise in skeletal muscle.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Assessing the ligand native-like pose using a quantum mechanical-derived hydropathic score for protein-ligand complementarity</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lacruz, B. M., Ramirez, W. Z., +4 authors, Luque, F. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Elucidating the correct binding mode of drug-like compounds is crucial to disclose the molecular determinants that underline the recognition by the target protein and estimate the binding affinity, thus guiding the ensuing hit-to-lead optimization. However, the choice of the near-native binding pose in docking experiments remains a major hurdle. Assuming that the hydropathic complementarity principle is the major driving force in ligand-protein recognition, the suitability of simple hydropathicity-based scoring functions to reveal the near-native pose was examined. A benchmarking dataset of 1000 ligand-protein complexes purposely designed to encompass bioactive and decoy poses was used to assess the performance of 3D hydropathicity atomic descriptors derived from empirical and quantum mechanical models. This strategy led to a predictive accuracy of ca. 90% when the non-negligible influence of the conformational stress is also considered. The results reveal the need to leverage nonpolar/polar chemical features for the successful discrimination of the near-native pose.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Deep Learning-Based Genetic Perturbation Models Do Outperform Uninformative Baselines on Well-Calibrated Metrics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Miller, H. E., Mejia, G. M., +3 authors, Camillo, L. P. d. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single cell genetic perturbation modeling involves predicting the effects of unobserved genetic manipulations, enabling scalable in silico screens for target discovery. Recent reports have claimed that deep learning-based perturbation models fail to outperform simple, uninformative baselines, raising doubts about their utility. Here, we show that these conclusions largely stem from limitations of benchmarking metrics, not from the models themselves. We introduce a framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration using positive and negative controls, including a new positive control baseline (the interpolated duplicate) and a quantitative calibration measure (the dynamic range fraction). Across 14 perturbation datasets and 13 evaluation metrics, we find that conventional metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and control-referenced delta correlation (Pearson({triangleup}ctrl)) are often poorly calibrated, whereas weighted and rank-based alternatives exhibit consistent calibration. Under well-calibrated metrics, deep learning models outperform mean, control, and linear baselines, and in some cases even surpass the additive baseline in combination-prediction tasks. Calibrated evaluation thus explains prior reports of model underperformance, revealing that deep learning models do outperform uninformative baselines.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting tumor antioxidant pathways with novel GSTP1/M2 inhibitors for cancer treatment</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kumpati, G. P., Ronayne, C. T., +4 authors, Mereddy, V. R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glutathione transferase (GSTP1 and GSTM2) are tractable targets for anticancer drug development. In this work, a series of 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX) based analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated both theoretically and experimentally as GSTP1 and GSTM2 inhibitors. Among the synthesized compounds, 3h showed selective inhibition toward GSTP1 while 5b showed selective inhibition of GSTM2. Compounds 5b and 5c exhibited stronger potency while compound 3h showed slightly lower potency against the tested cancer cells than its parent molecule NBDHEX. Comprehensive biological studies were conducted on the effect of 3h, 5b and 5c towards breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cell lines revealed that 3h, 5b and 5c could activate JNK pathway and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore in vivo experiments using NSG mice demonstrated that 5b significantly reduced tumor growth when administered in combination with gemcitabine, effectively overcoming gemcitabine resistance in the MiaPaCa-2 cell model through targeted inhibition of GSTM2. These findings suggests that, 5b could become a promising candidate for further development as a potential antitumor agent in cancer therapy.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Context-Dependent Effects of Midkine on Plexiform Neurofibroma Growth and Drug Response in 3D Coculture Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Rain, A. Z., Sundararaghavan, H. G., Ji, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Midkine (MDK) is a heparin-binding growth factor that promotes tumor growth in many cancers and may contribute to type I neurofibromatosis (NF1) tumor by stimulating Schwann cell proliferation and supporting neurofibroma growth. Here, we investigated the role of midkine in plexiform neurofibroma with NF1 (pNF1) using both monoculture and neuron-tumor coculture system with biomimetic neuronal axons engineered to release midkine in 3D. In monoculture, midkine enhanced the growth of pNF1 tumor cells, consistent with its tumor-promoting role in several cancers. In contrast, in 3D coculture, midkine did not increase tumor growth and failed to alter response to selumetinib, the FDA-approved treatment for pNF1. These findings suggest that while midkine promotes tumor growth, its effect may be buffered or neutralized in a neuron-associated microenvironment, underscoring the importance of physiologically relevant models for evaluating therapeutic targets in NF1.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A New anticancer substance from cancer cell apoptosis. CSS (Cancer cell Suicide Substance) production in culture.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tajima, T., Kondo, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is well-known that the cells die when a cancer cell line is continuously cultured without passage, even though it was kept in a fresh medium. However, none of this phenomenon's decisive causes and mechanism(s) have been elucidated yet. After the cancer cell death, the medium exserted cytocidality. This cancer cell death (e.g., spontaneous, apoptosis, programmed) was found to be caused by only one kind of cytocidal substance (MW&lt;1kDa) (named CSS) produced from the cells own component(s) by the cells themselves. CSS mammalian specifically by cancer cell lines but not nontumor cell lines and the CSS exerted cytocidality against other cell lines and vice versa regardless of species in mammalian. In vivo, CSS showed a significant life-prolonging effect without any adverse event. An established cell line derived from human renal cell carcinoma (HRC23) was used in this study as CSS was found and characterized by this cell line first.</p>
