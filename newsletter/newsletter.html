<h2 class="paper-title">ONCOchannelome: A computational framework to investigate altered ion channels across tumor types</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Parthasarathi, K. T. S., Ramu, S., +1 author, Sharma, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Conventional approaches in analyzing ion channels in cancer primarily focus on detection of membrane potential to record the polarization states of the cellular membrane. Ion channels are known to exhibit context dependent activity that often depends on cancer type and metabolic state of the tumor. Here, we developed a computational framework - ONCOchannelome that allows identification of potential ion channels using transcriptomic datasets. We collected publicly available RNA-Seq datasets corresponding to 2421 normal, 5442 primary tumors and 588 metastatic samples of 15 tumor types. Using the data we designed a computational strategy to merge the datasets, identifying differentially expressed ion channels in tumor and metastatic states aiding in determination of ion channels in the different tumor states. Subsequently, we developed strategies to determine the correlation of altered ion channels with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and to identify differentially co-expressed ion channel networks along with their possible transcription factors. The ONCOchannelome can be utilized to compare the alterations in ion channels in histological subtypes of lung cancer. The ONCOchannelome supports visualizing the altered ion channels in tumor and metastatic states in addition to providing the changes resulting in biological processes and molecular functions as the tumor progresses. The ONCOchannelome can be used to identify altered ion channels significant in various tumors that may aid in understanding tumor behaviour in turn facilitating exploration of their role in hallmarks of cancers.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering Clostridium thermocellum for production of 2,3-butanediol from cellulose</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Jilani, S. B., Ashok, N., +1 author, Olson, D. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clostridium thermocellum is a promising host for consolidated bioprocessing due to its ability to directly ferment cellulose into fuels and chemicals. However, natural product formation in this organism is limited. Here, we report engineering C. thermocellum for the production of 2,3-butanediol (23BD), a valuable industrial chemical. We functionally expressed a thermophilic 23BD pathway in this organism resulting in a 23BD titer of 19.7 mM from cellulose, representing a metabolic yield of 24%. We used a cell-free systems biology approach to identify limiting steps in the 23BD pathway, revealing that exogenous 23BD dehydrogenase (BDH) activity was essential for production, while native acetolactate synthase (ALS) and acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) activities were present but limiting in the parent strain. This approach also revealed redox balance limitations. We demonstrated that this improved understanding of redox balance limitations could be used to increase 23BD titer in vivo, showing that adding acetate could be used to increase 23BD yield. This work establishes a foundation for developing C. thermocellum into a robust platform for 23BD production directly from cellulose and highlights the utility of cell-free systems for guiding metabolic engineering in non-model organisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimization of heuristic logic synthesis by iteratively reducing circuit substructures using a database of optimal implementations</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tran, A. P., Jatkar, D. D., +2 authors, Sontag, E. D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Minimal synthesis of Boolean functions is an NP-hard problem, and heuristic approaches typically give suboptimal circuits. However, in the emergent field of synthetic biology, genetic logic designs that use even a single additional Boolean gate can render a circuit unimplementable in a cell. This has led to a renewed interest in the field of optimal multilevel Boolean synthesis. For small numbers (1-4) of inputs, an exhaustive search is possible, but this is impractical for large circuits. In this work, we demonstrate that even though it is challenging to build a database of optimal implementations for anything larger than 4-input Boolean functions, a database of 4-input optimal implementations can be used to greatly reduce the number of logical gates required in larger heuristic logic synthesis implementations. The proposed algorithm combines the heuristic results with an optimal implementation database and yields average improvements in fractional gate-count reduction relative to ABC of 5.16% for 5-input circuits and 4.54% for 6-input circuits on outputs provided by the logic synthesis tool ABC. In addition to the gains in the efficiency of the implemented circuits, this work also attests to the importance and practicality of the field of optimal synthesis, even if it cannot directly provide results for larger circuits. The focus of this work is on circuits made exclusively of 2-input NOR gates but the presented results are readily applicable to 2-input NAND circuits as well as (2-input) AND/NOT circuits. The framework proposed here is likely to be adaptable to other types of circuits. Moreover, a small computational pipeline is provided for integration with synthetic biology tools such as Cello. An implementation of the described algorithm, HLM (Hybrid Logic Minimizer), is available at https://github.com/sontaglab/HLM/.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genetic diversity, predictive protein structures, and interaction networks of Cysteine-Rich Receptor-Like Kinases in Arabidopsis thaliana</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Stouthamer, J., Pereira, D., +3 authors, Smakowska-Luzan, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) are a large subfamily of plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) implicated in immunity and development, yet their ligands, interaction partners, and mechanistic roles remain poorly defined. We combined population-genetic analyses and AlphaFold-based structural prediction to characterise the Arabidopsis thaliana CRK family. Phylogenetic reconstruction from 69 natural accessions resolved five well-supported CRK clades. Nucleotide diversity ({Xi}) ) and neutrality tests revealed heterogeneous diversity across loci, with evidence of both positive and negative selection pressure acting on different CRKs. AlphaFold models of CRK extracellular domains (ECDs) recapitulate the DUF26 structure observed in Plasmodesmata Localizing Protein (PDLP)5/PDLP8 and ginkbilobin-2 but display distinct biochemical properties and disulfide-bond topologies. Pairwise AlphaFold dimer modelling of all 780 CRK-ECD combinations produced 145 high-confidence interaction models; ~78% of these adopt a shared dimer conformation characterized by an extended intermolecular {beta}-sheet at the interface. Integrating evolutionary and structural approaches reveals clade-specific selective regimes and conserved structural features of CRK ECDs that likely underpin receptor receptor interactions. Predicted high-confidence dimer interfaces suggest a general mode of CRK-ECD association that can guide targeted biochemical and genetic validation, accelerating functional dissection of this important receptor family.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ClsDiff-AMP30: Generating Antimicrobial Peptides by a Classifier Guidance Noise Predictor</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yan, J., Cai, J., +7 authors, Siu, S. W. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising therapeutic strategy to combat the increasing challenge of multidrug-resistant pathogens, a crisis intensified by the overuse of conventional antibiotics. In addition to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low toxicity, and reduced propensity for resistance development, AMPs offer significant advantages over traditional antibiotic therapies. However, the discovery of novel AMPs through biological experiments remains constrained by high costs, labor-intensive workflows, and time-consuming procedures, underscoring the urgent need for in silico computational methods to design AMP sequences. In particular, shorter AMPs (&lt;= 30 residues) demonstrate superior antimicrobial efficacy, improved structural stability, and minimal cytotoxicity in human cells. To address these challenges, we present a classifier-guided diffusion framework specialized for generating AMPs shorter than 30 residues (ClsDiff-AMP30). The architecture integrates two interdependent submodels, including a noisy AMP classifier that evaluates AMP probability score at intermediate denoising steps and a noise predictor guided by classifier-derived probability scores, dynamically adjusted via a self-optimized coefficient to modulate guidance strength. ClsDiff-AMP30 achieves a generate accuracy of 66% across 10,000 synthesized sequences by a self-developed AMP classifier. Furthermore, wet lab experiments demonstrated that all 11 selected sequences exhibited high antimicrobial activity against at least one of the three tested bacterial strains and low hemolytic activity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dynamic optimization of chemo-immunotherapy sequencing reveals phenotype-dependent regimens across tumor immune microenvironments</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gong, K., Lu, T., +1 author, Liu, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the management of advanced cancers, yet durable responses remain restricted to subsets of patients and strongly depend on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Distinct hot and cold TIMEs differ in pre-existing effector T-cell activity and treatment-induced immunogenicity, suggesting that combination regimens should be tailored to microenvironmental context under realistic clinical constraints. Here we develop a deterministic dynamic optimization framework that jointly designs chemotherapy and ICI dosing schedules on a mechanistic tumor-immune model. The model tracks sensitive and resistant tumor cells, effector CD8+ T cells and circulating drug concentrations with pharmacodynamic couplings encoding immunogenic cell death and checkpoint inhibition. We formulate a continuous-time optimal control problem that balances tumor burden against drug exposure while enforcing cumulative dose limits, end-of-interval concentration bounds and bounds on stepwise changes in infusion rates. Using gradient-based optimization with embedded forward sensitivities, we solve the resulting nonlinear programs for four representative TIME phenotypes (extremely cold, hot, cold and cold with high antigenic resistance). The optimizer recovers qualitatively distinct and biologically interpretable regimens, including chemotherapy-dominated schedules in extremely cold TIMEs, aggressive early ICI administration in hot TIMEs and minimal ICI pulses in cold TIMEs. Alternative weightings of treatment objectives reveal trade-offs between tumor eradication and effector preservation. These results show that constrained dynamic optimization can systematically derive phenotype-specific, mechanistically consistent combination strategies and provide a reusable computational module for integrating TIME-resolved models into in silico trial and quantitative systems pharmacology workflows.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Displacement-Optimized Tanglegrams for Trees and Networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Huson, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phylogenetic trees and networks play a central role in biology, bioinformatics, and mathematical biology, and producing clear, informative visualizations of them is an important task. Tanglegrams, which display two phylogenies side by side with lines connecting shared taxa, are widely used for comparing evolutionary histories, host-parasite associations, and horizontal gene transfer. Existing layout algorithms have largely focused on trees and on minimizing the number of inter-taxon edge crossings. We introduce displacement-optimized tanglegrams (DO-tanglegrams), a new approach that applies equally to trees and rooted phylogenetic networks. Our method explicitly minimizes taxon displacement - the vertical misalignment of corresponding taxa across the two sides - and reticulate displacement - the vertical distance spanned by reticulation edges within a network. We formalize one-sided and two-sided optimization problems, show that exact minimization is computationally intractable, and propose a heuristic that combines exhaustive local search with simulated annealing. The algorithm naturally accommodates unresolved nodes (multifurcations or multicombinations) and missing taxa. We have implemented the DO-tanglegram algorithm in SplitsTree. We compare our implementation against the cophylo R-package on a collection of synthetic trees, and against the NN-tanglegram algorithm in Dendroscope on a collection of synthetic networks. The results indicate that DO-tanglegram performs significantly better than cophylo on trees and than NN-tanglegram on networks.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integrated proteogenomics uncovers ancestry-specific and shared molecular drivers in localized prostate cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Schafer, C. C., Abulez, T. S., +28 authors, Tan, S.-H.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our integrative proteogenomics (genome, proteome and phosphoproteome) of localized prostate cancer (PCa) in an equal-access Military Health System patient cohort (57 Black and 55 White) revealed significant ancestry-associated differences. Somatic and germline regulatory differences converged on androgen, metabolic, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, with ancestry-specific immune- and stromal-associated signals. Black patients displayed greater genomic variability, enhanced androgen response, fatty-acid metabolism, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while White patients showed prevalent DDRG alterations, activated oncogenic signaling (MYC, E2F, mTORC1), and cell cycle regulation. Phosphoproteomics highlighted distinct kinase activities and candidate druggable dependencies. Multiomics integration revealed three exploratory tumor subtypes whose distinct biological programs were reproducibly validated. Ancestry-associated eQTLs supported inherited regulation of the proteome independent of CNAs. Ancestry-specific CNA and protein panels improved progression risk prediction beyond PSA and pathology models. These findings provide a framework for ancestry-informed prognostic models and generate testable hypotheses for precision therapies to reduce outcome disparities.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Zhou, F. Y., Jacobs, B.-A., +11 authors, Lu, X.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Live cells in tissue are plastic, phenotypically dynamic, and modify their function in response to genetic and environmental perturbations. To unleash the power of live-cell imaging to identify phenotype-genotype-function coupling over time, we report the development of a standardized Shape-Appearance-Motion (SAM) "phenome" and SAM-Phenotype-Observation-Tool (SPOT), that act as an image-"transcriptome" and image-"transcriptome analyzer" respectively, and provide unbiased and comprehensive description of morpho-dynamic phenotypes without prior knowledge. We developed and applied SAM-SPOT to our simulated organoids database with known ground-truth and &gt;1.6 million mouse and human organoid instances with defined genetic and chemical perturbations. SAM-SPOT can effectively and robustly characterize 3D morpho-dynamics from 2D projection videos. Combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, SAM-SPOT revealed that altered WNT signaling, but not mutant RAS or p53, predisposes intestinal organoids to irregular morphogenesis. SAM-SPOT advances biomedical discovery by empowering live-cell imaging to identify phenotype-genotype-function relationships through large-scale and cost-effective label-free live-cell imaging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ATHENA: A deep learning-based AI for functional prediction of genomic mutations and synergistic vulnerabilities in prostate cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">CHENG, S., Jin, X., +4 authors, Mu, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying functional mutations that drive therapy resistance remains a major challenge in prostate cancer. Large-scale sequencing often produces extensive lists of mutations but provides limited insight into which alterations are functionally relevant. To overcome this gap, we developed ATHENA (Attention-based Therapeutic Network Analyzer), a deep learning-based AI framework that predicts the functional impact of genomic mutations and reveals their synergistic vulnerabilities. Integrated with our RNA/DNA-informed variant discovery pipeline OncoVar, ATHENA models nonlinear dependencies among mutations to distinguish driver events from passenger variants. Trained on large multi-cohort datasets and interpreted using SHAP analysis, ATHENA not only stratifies patients by clinical outcomes but also predicts which specific mutations alter tumor behavior and therapy response, enabling direct validation through base editing experiments. Applied to prostate cancer progression models, the OncoVar-ATHENA framework identified stage-specific driver signatures across castration-resistant, AR-variant-driven, and metastatic disease, and uncovered cooperative interactions such as SYVN1-STC2 that promote tumor proliferation. By moving beyond simple mutation identification, ATHENA enables functional prediction of genomic interactions. This approach accelerates the discovery of actionable targets and provides a foundation for rational design of next-generation combination therapies in advanced prostate cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metastasis is a leading cause of mortality in breast cancer patients, yet the signaling promoting metastatic dissemination is not completely understood. Prior literature implicates neuronal innervation in tumor progression, including recent studies in breast cancer progression with the 4T1 and PyMT cell line orthotopic injection models. Our experiments address the immune limitations of these studies with an alternative model to elucidate neuronal control of metastatic breast cancer by using a MMTV-PyMT transplant model and resiniferatoxin (RTX) for denervation. To this end, we generated a robust array of spontaneous MMTV-PyMT tumors with various histological subtypes. These tumors were transplanted into RTX challenged MMTV-Cre mice. In contrast to previous literature, denervation did not impact survival or tumor growth. Interestingly, we noticed a slight reduction in the percent of the solid poorly differentiated tumors with a corresponding increase in tumors that contained a mixed pathology in RTX challenged mice. Strikingly, and consistent with prior work, we noted a reduction in metastasis with denervation. Together these data suggest neuronal innervation promotes metastasis without impacting tumor growth.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">CanID: A Robust and Accurate RNA-seq Expression-based Diagnostic Classification Scheme for Pediatric Malignancies.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Daniel K Putnam, Alexander M Gout, +7 authors, Xiang Chen</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cancer subtype classification is critical for precision therapy and there is a growing trend of augmenting histopathology testing procedures with omics-based machine learning classifiers. However, analytical challenges remain for pediatric cancer on the scope and precision of the current classifiers as well as the evolving subtype standardization. To address these challenges, we built Cancer Identification or CanID, a stacked ensemble machine learning classification scheme, using the transcriptomic features derived from gene-level RNA sequencing count data as the sole input. CanID was developed primarily from 3203 pediatric cancer samples of 13 solid tumor subtypes and 38 hematologic malignancy subtypes with subtype labels curated without the use of RNA-seq data. The accuracies of independent testing in three independent or external data sets for Solid Tumor and Hematologic Malignancy are 99% and 92%-93%, respectively. Notably, CanID was able to classify subtypes challenging for clinical histology evaluation and was robust to both biological and technical challenges, including differences in data collection protocols, class imbalance, potential mislabeled training samples and classes unobserved in training. The high accuracy, robustness, biological interpretability of this transcriptome-based classification scheme represents a valuable approach to advance tumor diagnosis and clinically meaningful stratification of tumor types.

<h2 class="paper-title">LARIS enables accurate and efficient ligand and receptor interaction analysis in spatial transcriptomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dai, M., Torok, T., +7 authors, Chen, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics provide unprecedented opportunities to characterise intercellular communication pathways. However, robust and computationally efficient incorporation of spatial information into intercellular communication inference remains challenging. Here, we present LARIS (Ligand And Receptor Interaction analysis in Spatial transcriptomics), an accurate and scalable method that identifies cell type-specific and spatially restricted ligand-receptor (LR) interactions at single-cell or bead resolution. LARIS is compatible with all spatial transcriptomic technologies and quantifies specificity, infers sender-receiver directionality, and detects how differential interactions vary across time and space. To compare LARIS with existing methods, we established a simulation framework to generate ground truth of LR interactions with defined tissue architecture and gene expression patterns. LARIS demonstrates superior performances over other methods in accuracy and scalability. We further applied LARIS to human tonsil and developing mouse cortex spatial transcriptomics datasets collected from various spatial techniques. This uncovered the signalling mechanisms shaping tissue organisation and their changes over time. LARIS reveals cell type-, niche-, and condition-specific signalling and scales to hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes. This provides an efficient and direct method for discovering the molecular interplay between apposed cells across development.</p>
