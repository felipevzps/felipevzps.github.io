<h2 class="paper-title">OKR-Cell: Open World Knowledge Aided Single-Cell Foundation Model with Robust Cross-Modal Cell-Language Pre-training</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">wang, H., Zhang, X., +4 authors, Li, s.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Dissecting and steering cell dynamics using spatially-informed RNA velocity with veloAgent</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ding, J., Yoon, B., Raghavan, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA velocity enables inference of cell state transitions from single-cell transcriptomics by modeling transcriptional dynamics from spliced and unspliced mRNA. However, existing methods overlook spatial context and struggle to scale to large datasets, limiting insights into tissue organization and dynamic processes. We introduce veloAgent, a deep generative and agent-based framework that estimates gene- and cell-specific transcriptional kinetics while integrating spatial information through agent-based simulations of local microenvironments. By leveraging both molecular and spatial cues, veloAgent improves velocity accuracy and achieves sublinear memory scaling, enabling efficient analysis of large and multi-batch spatial datasets. A distinctive feature of veloAgent is its in silico perturbation module, which allows targeted manipulation of spatial velocity vectors to simulate regulatory interventions and predict their impact on cell fate dynamics. These capabilities position veloAgent as a scalable and versatile framework for dissecting spatially resolved cellular dynamics and guiding cell fate manipulation across diverse biological processes.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SegJointGene: joint cell segmentation and spatial gene prioritization by information entropy guided convolutional neural networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ma, H., Wang, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial sequencing technologies enable the study of molecular organization, such as gene and protein expression, at single-cell resolution. Revealing such spatial patterns relies on accurate cell segmentation. Particularly, in complex tissues with dense cell packing, segmentation based solely on nuclear staining is insufficient for accurate cell boundary detection. This limitation arises because accurate segmentation necessitates the delineation of cell morphology, which is driven by molecular activities such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell-cell adhesion, and intercellular signaling. Thus, integrating molecular information, such as gene or protein expression, is highly likely to enhance segmentation and understanding of molecular spatial organization, which, however, remains challenging. To address this, we developed SegJointGene, a novel deep learning framework that performs joint cell segmentation and spatial gene prioritization. SegJointGene inputs coarse, nuclei-based images and spatial gene (or protein) expression data, integrating them with an information-entropy guided convolutional neural network. Using such a specialized network, we further leveraged a computational information discarding (CID) score to prioritize gene importance for cell-type-specific segmentation. The model iteratively updates the gene scoring and refines cell segmentation, finally outputting both convergent cell segmentation and prioritized spatial genes across cell types. We applied SegJointGene with benchmarking to multiple real datasets, including spatial transcriptomics from the mouse hippocampus and distinct regions from whole mouse brain, and spatial proteomics from human tonsil. SegJointGene outperformed existing methods by 5-20%, in terms of the accuracy of assigning molecular spots to cell boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrated the robustness of SegJointGene through various ablation tests, including varying gene numbers and imaging resolutions. Moreover, we found that the genes prioritized by SegJointGene uncovered cell-type-specific segmentations, many of which are structural and developmental markers, and were enriched with synaptic signaling pathways and anatomical organization, including glial cell populations.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimizing photoautotrophic production of soluble 3-hydroxybutyrate in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 through combinatorial translational tuning</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kakko, L., Muth-Pawlak, D., +2 authors, Kallio, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While photosynthetic cyanobacteria are potential biotechnological hosts for light-driven production of sustainable chemicals from CO2, engineering more efficient strains is critical for the development of competitive industrial processes. This study demonstrates significantly enhanced production of the soluble bioplastic precursor (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) that has been engineered based on the polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) pathway in photoautotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. As the key novelty, we generated a library of engineered 3HB pathway variants that express the three key heterologous pathway enzymes PhaA, PhaB and TesB at varying efficiencies, followed by the screening of most efficient 3HB producers. This was achieved by placing each of the pathway enzymes under the translational regulation of three alternative RBSs in different combinations, resulting in strains with wide dynamic range of 3HB productivities. The best strains accumulated over 5 gl-1 under 200 mol photons m2 s-1 and 3% CO2 in a 14-day flask batch culture, with the highest titer reaching 12 gl-1, corresponding to nearly 3 gl-1 d-1 during the peak production phase. These are the highest 3HB production levels reported so far in cyanobacteria, and comparable to those previously established in heterotrophic production systems. Proteomic comparison of selected strains revealed that the different RBS combinations result in varying expression patterns of the pathway proteins, and that the strain-specific enzyme levels remained relatively constant over the monitored six-day period. The results show that altering the levels of the target pathway enzymes can dramatically improve product yield in Synechocystis, while even very small quantitative differences in the strain-specific expression profiles can have marked effects on the production efficiency. This could be a general tool for optimizing engineered pathways in cyanobacteria, provided that the flux to the end-product is not critically restricted by substrate availability but determined by the balance between the consecutive pathway steps.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unifying constraints linking protein folding and native dynamics decoded from AlphaFold</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, Z., Ren, W., +5 authors, Tang, Q.-Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The interplay between protein folding and native dynamics remains a central question in biophysics. Analyzing an extensive set of AlphaFold-predicted structures, we uncover a robust relationship between folding topology (contact order) and native dynamics (fluctuation entropy), showing that long-range contacts that slow folding also restrict conformational flexibility across protein sizes and taxonomic groups. Scaling analysis reveals that this relationship, together with its chain-length dependence, is consistent with power-law-like trends, reflecting common organizing constraints of protein architecture. Across species, increasing organismal complexity is associated with proteome-wide shifts toward lower contact order and higher fluctuation entropy. Together, evidence from folding, stability, and functional dynamics converges on unifying constraints, revealing an intrinsic physical organizing principle captured by AI models.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Love-thy-neighbor: Neural networks for tracking and lineage tracing in budding yeast</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zelic, M., Gligorovski, V., +9 authors, Rahi, S. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tracking and lineage tracing are widely needed tasks in biological image analysis. For cells that grow and divide, tracking is challenging because cells change in number, shape, and size throughout a recording. As the time interval between images increases, it becomes more difficult to establish correspondences between cells across timepoints. Consequently, tracking has to be performed between consecutive or temporally close images, which leads to exponentially decreasing tracking accuracy and thus high sensitivity to error rates. For budding yeast, this challenge is further heightened by the similarity of cells in colonies, their dense packing, the asymmetric nature of cell divisions, and movement due to growth of the colony. A related task, lineage tracing, is similarly challenging without fluorescent markers due to multiple potential mother cells surrounding a new daughter cell. Here, we present neural networks for budding yeast tracking and lineage tracing, named LYN-track and LYN-trace, respectively. These methods leverage fine geometric features of cells and their neighborhoods. To train and test the algorithms, we recorded and annotated new budding and fission yeast microscopy movies (78,852 frame-to-frame tracklets, 2,512 images), which we make freely available. On these and existing datasets, our neural network-based methods demonstrate robust, above state-of-the-art performance. Both tools have been integrated into graphical user interfaces (GUIs), available on Github, and can be straightforwardly retrained with custom data if desired.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">The practical impact of numerical variability on structural MRI measures of Parkinson's disease</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chatelain, Y. M. B., Sokołowski, A., +2 authors, Glatard, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Numerical variability is rarely quantified in neuroimaging despite many biomarkers relying on subtle morphometric differences across individuals. We instrumented FreeSurfer, a widely used neuroimaging pipeline, to simulate numerical differences across computational environments, and used it to measure numerical variability in MRI analyses of Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In multiple cortical and subcortical regions, numerical variation reached nearly one-third of the population variability, altering statistical conclusions about group differences and clinical associations. To address this, we developed a practical tool that estimates the Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR), enabling researchers to assess the impact of numerical noise in existing studies. By applying this framework to thirteen previously published studies reporting MRI measures of Parkinson's disease, we quantified the probability of numerically induced false positives in the literature, highlighting a substantial impact of numerical variability on MRI measures of Parkinson's disease. These results underscore the importance of systematically evaluating numerical stability in neuroimaging.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Regulation of gastric cancer progression by immune-related transcription factors CEBPB in Helicobacter Pylori infection</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Wang, Z., Lei, Z., Chen, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Helicobacter pylori infection is a primary risk factor for gastric carcinogenesis, yet the heterogeneity of host cellular responses remains incompletely characterized. This study systematically delineates the transcriptional landscapes of four gastric epithelial cell lines (AGS, GES-1, HGC-27, MKN-45) upon H. pylori infection. Transcriptomic analyses revealed distinct, cell-type-specific dysregulation patterns, with Gene Ontology enrichment highlighting perturbations in processes ranging from epidermal differentiation and metabolism (AGS) to extracellular matrix remodeling (GES-1), cell cycle control (HGC-27), and mitotic regulation (MKN-45). Intersection analysis identified a conserved core signature of 41 upregulated and 11 downregulated genes, implicating unified stress, inflammatory, and metabolic responses. From this signature, nine key transcription factors (TFs) were extracted, with CEBPB and MAFF demonstrating significant prognostic value in gastric adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohorts. Subsequent pan-cancer investigation established CEBPB as a context-dependent regulator, showing upregulation in STAD and other malignancies where its high expression correlated with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, CEBPB expression in STAD was associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment (correlating with M2 macrophages and dendritic cells), co-expression with chemokine and checkpoint genes, and elevated metrics of genomic instability (MATH, ploidy, LOH). These findings position CEBPB as a central mediator linking H. pylori infection to oncogenic reprogramming, immune evasion, and genomic chaos in gastric cancer, offering a multifaceted target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Selective targeting of RalA with intrabodies impairs Triple Negative Breast Cancer metastasis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sarre, C., Jerabkova-Roda, K., +13 authors, Martineau, P.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study successfully developed and validated isoform-specific intrabodies targeting the highly homologous Ral oncoproteins, key effectors in cancer progression. Phage display was used to isolate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) clones that recognize specifically RalA (C1-A, G5-A), RalB (F6-B), or both paralogs (A12-AB). Using lentiviral transduction, these intrabodies were stably expressed as GFP fusions in murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The anti-RalA clones C1-A and A12-AB demonstrated clear colocalization with RalA, confirming their binding activity inside the cell. We further confirmed their activity in cells by analyzing Ral-dependent pathways. All intrabodies targeting RalA (C1-A, G5-A, A12-AB) but not the one specific to RalB inhibited mitochondrial fission, a known RalA function. All clones, except the pan-Ral one, altered the endo-lysosome pathway by decreasing lysosome number. Furthermore, the RalA-specific C1-A clone reduced lysosomes size, and uniquely and strongly reduced extracellular vesicle secretion, highlighting its distinct inhibitory potential. In an orthotopic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) mouse model, The C1-A RalA specific clone significantly but weakly reduced primary tumor growth, but exerted a powerful anti-metastatic effect, dramatically reducing lung metastases, with a complete abolition of metastases observed in 2/5 mice. In summary, these potent, isoform-specific Ral intrabodies act as effective intracellular inhibitors, successfully modulating RalA-specific functions in cells and offering a promising therapeutic strategy for significantly suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Jacobson, D. H., McClurg, D. P., +14 authors, Zhuang, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. OAC and its precursor, Barrett oesophagus (BO), are defined by substantial early heterogeneity, complicating prevention and treatment of OAC and remaining poorly recapitulated by current in vitro and animal model systems. We have generated 116 patient- and healthy donor- derived organoids (PDOs) spanning normal oesophagogastric tissue, BO and OAC. These PDOs capture population diversity and recapitulate phenotypic, genomic and transcriptomic features of their respective disease stages. We develop a single cell-derived clonal organoid approach and show that this enables us to capture the heterogeneity and isolate high-risk, subclonal populations that are difficult to discern and maintain in bulk PDO cultures. Using this platform, we demonstrate functional importance of this biobank across the pre-malignant to invasive disease spectrum, including a role for BO in shaping fibroblast phenotype within assembloids, and diverse responses of OAC to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted CDK4/6 inhibition.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Genotype-phenotype mapping identifies fetal-like CD55+ immunoregulatory cancer cells as mediators of immune escape in colorectal cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mastel, M., Guiseris Martinez, A., +14 authors, Jackstadt, R.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune evasion is a defining feature of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), yet the cellular mechanisms linking cancer cell states to immune suppression remain poorly understood. To systematically map tumour-immune interactions in advanced CRC, we modelled recurrent human CRC mutations using a multiplex CRISPR-based genetically engineered mouse model platform. The resulting 20 models recapitulate key stages, genetic routes and histopathological features of human CRC, while single-cell transcriptomics reveals extensive disease complexity across models. Profiling of the epithelial tumour compartment identified a population of fetal-like immunoregulatory cancer cells (IRCs) characterized by interferon-gamma and MAPK activity. IRCs are marked by expression of the membrane-bound complement regulatory protein CD55. Mechanistically, CD55 protects IRCs from immune surveillance and complement-mediated lysis. Together, these findings reveal a cancer cell-immune interface that promotes immune evasion in advanced CRC.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Reverse molecular pharmacology identifies the non-canonical axis of IRAK as a chemoresistance factor in neuroblastoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Le Grand, M., Buxbaum, C., +16 authors, Pasquier, E.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Owing to chemoresistance, the prognosis of relapsed neuroblastoma is dismal with less than 10% of patients surviving after 5 years. We developed a reverse molecular pharmacology approach that is based on high-throughput drug screening coupled with chemo-informatic and transcriptomic analyses. This led to the identification of IRAK1 as a key chemoresistance factor in neuroblastoma. By performing functional and pharmacological drug combination screens targeting IRAK1, we revealed a synergy between IRAK1 inhibition/silencing and BET, EGFR and mTOR inhibitors as well as microtubule-targeting agents. The synergistic combination of microtubule-targeting agent, vincristine and IRAK inhibitors was then confirmed in tumor spheroids, patient-derived tumoroids and a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, IRAK inhibition potentiated the pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest properties of vincristine via a pathway involving the PIDDosome complex rather than its canonical MyDDosome axis. Altogether, this study represents a proof-of-concept of our reverse molecular pharmacology approach to quickly develop biology-guided drug combinations, that could be applied to any other human diseases.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">LIMPACAT: Multi-omics attention transformer for immune prediction in liver cancer using whole-slide imaging.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yen-Jung Chiu</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment from histopathological images offers opportunities for ex vivo immune profiling and prognostic assessment. However, the TCGA-LIHC dataset lacks direct immune cell composition data. Therefore, this study aims to introduce Liver Immune Microenvironment Prediction and Classification Attention Transformer (LIMPACAT), a deep learning framework that leverages whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict immune cell levels relevant to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. Immune cell compositions were inferred using a deconvolution approach, with bulk RNA-seq profiles simulated from liver-specific single-cell RNA sequencing data and processed with multiple normalization methods. These inferred compositions served as supervision signals to train a multiple instance learning model with an attention transformer. LIMPACAT exhibited ~80% accuracy in classifying immune cell levels from HCC WSIs, showing strong concordance between model prediction and deconvolution-derived estimates. These findings suggest that WSIs can serve as a proxy for immune profiling, facilitating pathology-based tumor microenvironment assessment and supporting personalized therapeutic strategies.</p>
