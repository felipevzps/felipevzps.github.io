<h2 class="paper-title">Navigating the conjugated metabolome</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Xing, S., Patan, A., +12 authors, Dorrestein, P. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Life's chemical diversity far exceeds current biochemical maps. While metabolomics has catalogued tens of thousands of small molecules, conjugated metabolites, formed when two or more molecular entities are covalently fused through amidation, esterification, or related chemistries, remain underexplored. These molecules can act as microbial signals, detoxification intermediates, or endogenous regulators. Here, we mined 1.32 billion MS/MS spectra across public metabolomics repositories using reverse spectral searching coupled with delta-mass inference to map conjugation events. We generated structural hypotheses for 24,227,439 MS/MS clusters. From these, we inferred 217,291 substructure pairs with dual spectral support and 3,412,720 candidate conjugates with single-match support. Predictions span host-microbe co-metabolites, diet-derived conjugates, and drug-derived species, including drug-ethanolamine and creatinine conjugates with altered bioactivities. We also uncover a family of steroid-phosphoethanolamine conjugates. Fifty-five conjugates were matched by MS/MS of synthetic standards for this work, with 27 additionally supported by retention time matching in biological samples. Guidance on how to leverage this resource is also provided. Together, these results deliver a pan-repository map of potential conjugation chemistry, establish a resource for structural discovery and MS/MS annotation, and offer a scalable framework to explore the scope and diversity of the conjugated metabolome.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">EpiExpr: Predicting gene expression using epigenetic data and chromatin interactions</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">BHATTACHARYYA, S., AY, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Decoding gene expression from epigenomic landscapes remains a fundamental challenge in genomics. We introduce EpiExpr, a flexible deep learning framework that predicts gene expression from 1D epigenetic tracks (EpiExpr-1D) and integrates 3D chromatin interactions (EpiExpr-3D) to capture distal regulatory effects. Leveraging residual convolutional networks and graph neural networks, including graph attention and graph transformer models, EpiExpr models both local and long-range regulatory influences. Applied to GM12878 and K562 cells, EpiExpr-1D and 3D improve gene expression prediction relative to reference approaches. Analysis using CRISPRi-FlowFISH validated enhancers confirms that EpiExpr-3D accurately prioritizes regulatory elements, compatible with activity-by-contact scores. Remarkably, EpiExpr achieves performance comparable to DNA sequence-based transformer models without requiring sequence embeddings, offering a computationally efficient alternative. This approach provides a scalable, multi-resolution framework (https://github.com/souryacs/3CExpr) for dissecting the contributions of epigenetic modifications and 3D genome organization to gene regulation, enabling broader application across cell types and experimental settings.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Aviti Sequencing and Marker Gene Data Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Gould, T. J., Taylor, M., Santelli, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate identification of microbial species in complex populations and communities relies on the isolation of representative marker 16S, ITS, and 18S sequences through the use of DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing. Aviti sequencing has brought an improvement in the read quality and depth of marker gene sequencing technology. Quality scores exceeding Q40 representing highly accurate sequencing allows researchers to ask more questions of their marker gene data. However, this improvement in quality and throughput also brings with it a surprising increase in diversity of amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) making further analysis and comparisons to previous studies on Illumina platforms challenging. This increased diversity causes downstream processing issues, including an over-reporting of chimeric ASVs. Here we identify this problem and put forward straightforward solutions to retain counts and reduce technically introduced diversity, as well as tying chimeric read identification to minimum parent distance. Through the use of synthetic mock samples, we discovered that erroneous ASVs are systematically substitution errors introduced by the upstream PCR methods. This error can be reduced significantly bioinformatically through clustering of ASVs within 99% similarity. Further we highlight technically introduced variation as a result of variable region length, sample misassignment, and sample biomass. Collectively, these results improve the similarity of Aviti and Illumina datasets for better comparisons of microbial studies from different platforms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">HiCInterpolate: 4D Spatiotemporal Interpolation of Hi-C Data for Genome Architecture Analysis.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chowdhury, H. M. A. M., Oluwadare, O.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Studying the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a genome, including chromatin loops and Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), is essential for understanding how the genome is organized, such as gene activation, cell development, protein-protein interaction, etc. Hi-C protocol enables us to study 3D genome structure and organization. Chromatin 3D structure changes dynamically over time, and modeling these continuous changes is crucial for downstream analysis in various domains such as disease diagnosis, vaccine development, etc. The high expense and impracticality of continuous genome sequencing, particularly what evolves between two timestamps, limit the most effective genomic analysis. It is crucial to develop a straightforward and cost-efficient method for constantly generating genomic data between two timestamps in order to address these constraints. Results: In this study, we developed HiCInterpolate, a 4D spatiotemporal interpolation architecture that accepts two timestamp Hi-C contact matrices to interpolate intermediate Hi-C contact matrices at high resolution. HiCInterpolate predicts the intermediate Hi-C contact map using a deep learning-based flow predictor, and a feature encoder and decoder architecture similar to U-Net. In addition, HiCInterpolate supports downstream analysis of multiple 3D genomic features, including A/B compartments, chromatin loops, TADs, and 3D genome structure, through an integrated analysis pipeline. Across multiple evaluation metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, GenomeDISCO, HiCRep, and LPIPS, HiCInterpolate 1 achieved consistently strong performance. Biological validation further demonstrated preservation of key chromatin organization features, such as chromatin loops, A/B compartments, and TADs. Together, these results indicate that HiCInterpolate provides a robust computer vision-based framework for highresolution interpolation of intermediate Hi-C contact matrices and facilitates biologically meaningful downstream analyses. Availability: HiCInterpolate is publicly available at https://github.com/OluwadareLab/ HiCInterpolate.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">UniFacePoint-FM: A Foundation Model for Generalizable 3D Facial Representation Learning and Multi-Attribute Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, D., Fu, C.-H., Tang, K.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human face is a rich medium for biometric, behavioral, and clinical information. However, 2D facial images based technologies lack critical geometric details and are susceptible to pose and illumination interference, while 3D facial deep learning frameworks are hindered by complex annotation, preprocessing, and task-specific designs with poor cross-domain generalization. To address these challenges, we propose UniFacePoint-FM, a 3D facial foundation model built on a self-supervised Point-MAE framework, tailored for high-fidelity point cloud representation learning. The model was pretrained on a self-constructed dataset of high-resolution 3D facial scans, followed by supervised fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluation across three independent datasets for diverse downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that UniFacePoint-FM is both pretraining-efficient and highly generalizable: it achieves state-of-the-art performance on gender classification, age regression, and BMI prediction, and matches the accuracy of the ResMLP model (while outperforming other baselines) in facial expression recognition. Notably, by learning high-quality, fine-grained representations directly from raw point clouds, UniFacePoint-FM delivers robust generalization and transferability across tasks, datasets, and even different face scanning platforms. Overall, our work establishes an effective foundation model paradigm for 3D facial analysis, with promising implications for biometric security, health monitoring, and advanced human-computer interaction systems.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">From Structure to Dynamics: Activation Mechanism of the G Protein-Coupled Bile Acid Receptor 1-Gs Complex</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Fiorillo, B., Moraca, F., +5 authors, Catalanotti, B.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) is a key mediator of bile acid signaling, exerting its physiological effects through coupling with the stimulatory G protein (Gs). This interaction is essential for stabilizing the receptor's active conformation and triggering downstream signaling. Among endogenous ligands, lithocholic acid (LCA) is the most potent natural agonist. However, the dynamic features underlying its binding and activation mechanisms remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the interaction between LCA and GPBAR1, as well as the functional consequences of this interaction on receptor activation by integrating homology modelling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our calculations reveal that LCA binding stabilizes the active state of GPBAR1, biasing the conformational ensemble of TM5 and TM6, as well as the main microswitches. These ligand-induced rearrangements enhance the coupling interface with the 5 helix of Gs and facilitate allosteric communication between the orthosteric and intracellular sites. Overall, our findings provide dynamic insight into how LCA modulates GPBAR1 activation and G protein engagement, highlighting its role as a molecular effector in bile acid signaling, and furnishing molecular detail relevant to ongoing efforts in GPBAR1-targeted compound development.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Generalise or Memorise? Benchmarking Ligand-Conditioned Protein Generation from Sequence-Only Data</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Vicente, A., Dornfeld, L., +1 author, Ferruz, N.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proteins can bind small molecules with high specificity. However, designing proteins that bind user-defined ligands remains a challenge, typically relying on structural information and costly experimental iteration. While protein language models (pLMs) have shown promise for unconditional generation and conditioning on coarse functional labels, instance-level conditioning on a specific ligand has not been evaluated using purely textual inputs. Here we frame small-molecule protein binder design as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem and train ligand-conditioned pLMs that map molecular strings to candidate binder sequences. We curate large-scale ligand-protein datasets (&gt;17M ligand-protein pairs) covering different data regimes and train a suite of models, spanning 16 to 700M parameters. Results reveal a consistent trade-off driven by supervision ambiguity: when each ligand is paired with few proteins, models generate near-neighbour, foldable sequences; when each ligand is paired with many proteins, generations are more diverse but less consistently foldable. Our study exposes how annotation diversity and sampling choices elicit this behaviour and how it changes with the data distribution. These insights highlight dataset redundancy and incompleteness as key bottlenecks for sequence-only binder design. We release the curated datasets, trained models, and evaluation tools to support future work on ligand-conditioned protein generation.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Targeting Myc activates a tissue-specific tumour resolution programme</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Kortlever, R. M., Campos, T., +3 authors, Evan, G. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neoplastic transformation parallels hallmark cellular programs of tissue regeneration and wound repair1,2. However, the mechanisms driving tumour regression upon oncogenic driver inhibition - and why it often fails - remain poorly understood3-7. Oncogenic KRas mutations and Myc deregulation, two archetypal cancer drivers, frequently occur and cooperate to promote aggressive lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)8-12. To investigate the mechanistic consequences of targeting Myc in LUAD, we applied spatiotemporally controlled genetic and functional perturbations in a reversible KRas/Myc-driven mouse model, integrated with RNA sequencing and immune protein profiling of tumours and their microenvironment. Acute oncogenic Myc inactivation in epithelial tumour cells elicits a localised regenerative immune response crucially dependent on rapid, transient release of the alarmin cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) by alveolar type 2 tumour cells. As a sentinel signal for Myc loss, IL-33 signalling reverses tumour immunosuppression and neoangiogenesis, critically recruits eosinophils, and promotes neoplastic cell elimination, driving regression beyond mere growth arrest. Notably, brief systemic recombinant IL-33 administration to mice with KRas/Myc-driven LUAD induces robust eosinophil influx and near-complete tumour resolution. Together, these findings demonstrate that blocking Myc activates an innate, tissue-intrinsic immune programme rooted in resolution of wound repair and capable of driving regression when activated in a tumour. This opens the possibility of treating cancer not only by blocking mitogenic oncogenic drivers but also by pro-actively triggering pro-resolution pathways.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evaluation and application of chemical decrosslinking in the context of histopathological spatial proteomics</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Nwosu, A. J., Chen, L., +5 authors, Pasa-Tolic, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Laser capture microdissection (LCM) - based spatial mass spectrometry proteomics is a rapidly emerging technique with strong potential for use in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Several sample-preparation methods have been developed to decrosslink FFPE proteins for spatial proteomics; however, residual crosslinks often remain, and depth can remain impaired relative to fresh frozen tissue samples. To increase proteome coverage in spatially resolved LCM-FFPE samples, we investigated a panel of chemical compounds with the potential to catalyze the decrosslinking of nucleophilic functional groups on proteins. Systematic screening and optimization of temperature, incubation time, and reagent concentration led to the identification of 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid as an effective agent for improving proteome coverage in FFPE pancreatic tissue. This compound could boost precursor identifications by more than 10% at both reduced (70 C) and high (90 C) temperatures. Application of this chemical-decrosslinking strategy to a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissue section enabled the identification of numerous cell-type enriched proteins with clinical and therapeutic relevance. Taken together, our findings show that chemical decrosslinking can increase proteome coverage in FFPE tissues, thereby advancing our understanding of tissue microenvironments in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A microenvironment-determined risk continuum refines subtyping in meningioma and reveals determinants of machine learning-based tumor classification.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Sybren L N Maas, Yiheng Tang, +64 authors, Felix Sahm</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Classification of tumors in neuro-oncology today relies on molecular patterns (mostly DNA methylation) and their machine learning-supported interpretation. Understanding the process of algorithmic interpretation is essential for safe application in clinical routine. This is paradigmatically true for the most common primary intracranial tumor in adults, meningioma. Here, by applying multiomic profiling and multiple lines of orthogonal computational evaluation in multiple independent datasets, we found that not only tumor cell characteristics but also incremental changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have impact on epigenetic meningioma classification and clinical outcome. Besides revealing the decisive role of non-neoplastic cells in the CNS methylation classifier, this challenges the model of distinct meningioma subgroups toward a TME-determined risk continuum. This refines current controversies in molecular meningioma subtyping. In addition, we apply these learnings to devise and validate a simple diagnostic approach for increased clinical prediction accuracy based on immunohistochemistry, which is also applicable in resource-limited settings.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-omics and machine learning framework reveals ABCG2 as a therapeutic target of Eleven Flavored Shenqi Tablets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dong Zhang, Xinglin Chen, +6 authors, Xinyu Zhai</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eleven Flavored Shenqi Tablets (EFST) is a classical multi-herbal prescription in traditional Chinese medicine, traditionally prescribed for kidney tonification and systemic regulation. Despite its reported anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties, the therapeutic value of EFST in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear.</p>
