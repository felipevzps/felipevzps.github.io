<h2 class="paper-title">nVenn2: faster, simpler generalized quasi-proportional Venn diagrams</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pis-Vigil, S., Gonzalez-Pereira, M., +1 author, Quesada, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Proportional Venn diagrams provide a compact representation of the relationships between sets. Each relationship is represented with a region whose area reflects the number of elements shared by a given combination of sets. This means that the number of regions grows exponentially with the number of sets, which is why proportional Venn diagrams with more than five sets are cumbersome to interpret and seldom used. However, Venn diagrams with a large number of sets may still be legible if enough regions are empty and do not need be represented. Here, we present nVenn2, the second version of the nVenn algorithm, to create quasi-proportional Venn diagrams. This new version uses a different, more flexible approach which includes steps to minimize the complexity of the diagram. Thus, computation time for nVenn2 mainly grows with the number of non-empty diagram regions, rather than with the number of sets. This property allows users to create interpretable quasi-proportional Venn diagrams with large numbers of sets. The nVenn2 algorithm is freely available as an executable program, as a web page, as an R package (nVennR2) and as a Python package (nVennPy). All interfaces allow users to edit the appearance of the resulting diagram.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Evaluating valid parameter regimes for biocircuits</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Liu, Q., Xiao, F.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biocircuits often realize their functions only within specific parameter regimes, yet identifying those regimes and quantifying how difficult they are to satisfy remain challenging. Powered by the recently developed Reaction Order Polyhedra (ROP) framework enabling a holistic analysis of the behavior in biomolecular networks, we are now able to analyze these questions in a systematic way. In this work, we use ROP to derive the conditions under which Hill-like behaviors and adaptation in enzymatic negative feedback biocircuits can emerge. We also introduce the Realizability Index (R-index), i.e. the volume fraction of valid parameter regions, to quantify how hard it is for a biocircuit to achieve a desired function. We envision ROP theory and the R-index as important components of a new validity-aware conceptual language for studying and designing functional biocircuits.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">PocketGNN: A Cross-Modal Framework Unifying Local 3D Pocket Geometry and Global Sequence Semantics for Enzyme Kinetic Prediction</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Z., Lu, D.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The enzyme turnover number (kcat) is a pivotal kinetic parameter for understanding biocatalytic efficiency, yet its accurate prediction remains a grand challenge due to the complex interplay between local physicochemical constraints and global evolutionary context. Existing methods typically bifurcate into sequence-based approaches, which capture evolutionary semantics but miss fine-grained spatial details, or structure-based models, which often suffer from noise in whole-protein representations or lack global context. To bridge this gap, we propose PocketGNN, a cross-modal deep learning framework that synergizes the precision of local 3D geometry with the breadth of global 1D sequence semantics. PocketGNN introduces a high-fidelity graph representation of the active pocket, enriched with a novel 24-dimensional geometric edge encoding (RBF distances, bond angles, dihedral angles) to capture the stereochemical determinants of catalysis. Crucially, this local structural view is fused with global evolutionary information extracted from pre-trained protein language models (ESM-2), creating a unified representation that spans spatial scales. Evaluated on a rigorous dataset derived from IntEnzyDB, PocketGNN achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.98 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.918 for log10(kcat) under standard random splitting. Furthermore, under a strict 40% sequence identity split designed to test zero-shot generalization to unseen families, the model maintains a robust correlation (r=0.67, R2=0.44), significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods including CatPred (r=0.52) and CataPro (r=0.50). Interpretability analysis confirms that the model successfully attends to key catalytic residues, validating its ability to learn chemically meaningful structure-function relationships rather than mere sequence memorization.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">VAETracer: Mutation-Guided Lineage Reconstruction and Generational State Inference from scRNA-seq</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pan, L., Wang, K., Chen, L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Somatic mutations accumulate with cell division and are key to understanding tumor evolution. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can effectively capture somatic mutations in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), enabling its use for lineage tracing, these data are inherently noisy and exhibit high false-positive rates. To address this limitation, we propose VAETracer, a deep learning framework that is able to reconstruct cellular lineages by extracting cellular generation index (CGI) from mutation profiles of 3' UTR in scRNA-seq data, thus enabling the inference of developmental trajectories without relying on noisy mutation signals (https://github.com/Kaiyu-W/VAETracer). There are two core components for VAETracer: (1) scMut module, which infers the CGI directly from sparse and noisy mutation matrices using our cumulative mutation model (CMM), effectively bypassing error-prone phylogenetic tree topologies caused by mutation noise, and (2) MutTracer module, which predicts ancestral and future latent cellular states or gene expressions at the single-cell level by integrating CGI information with measured transcriptomes. Validation on simulated and real tumor datasets shows that this method can accurately reconstruct clonal relationships, quantify tumor progression, and effectively infer unmeasured cellular states using only the measured scRNA-seq data. This work provides a new computational tool for extracting lineage information and revealing tumor evolution directly from widely available RNA-seq data.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SPSID: A single-parameter shrinkage inverse-diffusion for denoising gene regulatory networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Chen, H., Han, G., +1 author, Grazian, C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data is a fundamental problem in systems biology, but its accuracy is often undermined by structural noise arising from transitive correlations. These indirect interactions can obscure the true regulatory architecture, leading to a high rate of false positives. To address this, we introduce SPSID (Single-Parameter Shrinkage Inverse-Diffusion), a novel and robust network denoising framework. SPSID employs a principled spectral filter, built upon a shrinkage-regularized inverse-diffusion operator, to mathematically distinguish direct, one-step interactions from multi-step, indirect paths. This approach guarantees numerical stability and, through a fixed default parameter, effectively eliminates the need for data-dependent tuning. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of SPSID on both extensive simulations and the gold-standard DREAM5 benchmark. The results demonstrate that SPSID outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both AUROC and AUPR, exhibiting good stability across diverse network conditions. Furthermore, it functions as a post-processing tool, elevating the performance of multiple upstream GRN inference methods. By providing a computationally efficient and parameter-free solution to filter structural noise, SPSID offers a readily applicable tool for uncovering the underlying topology of complex biological networks with greater fidelity.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Engineering a PD-L1-sensing synthetic receptor for programmable macrophage-mediated phagocytosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">De Martino, I., Russo, L., +1 author, Siciliano, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Macrophages are abundant immune cells within the tumor microenvironment with intrinsic phagocytic capabilities, yet their antitumor functions are frequently suppressed by inhibitory signals. Synthetic biology enables the rational design of ligand-responsive genetic circuits to reprogram immune cell behavior. Here, we report the engineering of a synthetic Notch-based receptor that detects PD-L1, an immune-checkpoint broadly expressed by cancer cells. Upon PD-L1 engagement, the circuit triggers programmable outputs, including expression of a fluorescent reporter or CV1-Fc, that locally blocks the CD47 don't eat me signal. We show that circuit activation scales with PD-L1 levels, partially attenuates PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, and that conditional CV1-Fc expression enhances engulfment of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells by THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Collectively, this work reframes PD-L1 from an end-point therapeutic target to a primary input signal for synthetic circuit activation and establishes a modular framework for engineering macrophage behaviour through spatially confined, ligand-responsive control.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Cardiac GLP1R gene Expression: A Cross-Species Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dostal, C., Ernst, M., +5 authors, Kiss, A.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists improve glycaemic control, induce weight loss, and consistently reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. However, the mechanistic basis of their cardioprotective effects remains incompletely understood, particularly whether benefits arise solely from systemic actions or also involve direct cardiac GLP1R signalling. To address this, we performed integrated single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics to map GLP1R gene expression across human and murine organs, cardiac cell types, disease states, and hiPSC-derived cardiac organoids. In humans, GLP1R expression was predominantly pancreatic, with low cardiac expression largely restricted to cardiomyocytes and consistently upregulated across ischaemic, dilated, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, murine cardiac Glp1r expression was confined to endocardial cells and remained unchanged in heart disease. Other cardiac cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mural cells, showed minimal GLP1R expression in both species. Human cardiac organoids recapitulated ventricular GLP1R patterns closer to adult human myocardium than murine tissue. Together, these findings indicate that GLP1R is primarily extracardiac but selectively induced in failing human myocardium, supporting a model in which myocardial GLP1R signalling augments systemic mechanisms to confer GLP1R agonist-mediated cardioprotection.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Integration-coupled activation of promoterless combinatorial pathway libraries in Clostridium avoids burden during DNA assembly</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mordaka, P. M., Williamson, J., Heap, J. T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Combinatorial DNA design and assembly is an efficient and pragmatic way to obtain high-performing metabolic pathway designs quickly. However, implementation may require organism-specific technical barriers to be overcome. Firstly, suitable expression control parts such as promoters and ribosome-binding sites (RBSs) which provide a suitable range of expression levels need to be identified or developed. Secondly, these need to be assembled into pathway-encoding combinatorial libraries of sufficient size, quality and diversity. For organisms with transformation frequencies too low to allow direct transformation of library assembly reactions, such as many Clostridium spp., assembly and amplification is typically carried out using Escherichia coli. However, if constructs are deleterious (or 'burdensome') to E. coli, which is often the case when using Clostridium genetic parts, poor libraries may be obtained. Here we develop a new approach called integration-coupled activation of promoterless sequences (ICAPS) to overcome this barrier and therefore enable combinatorial assembly in Clostridium. Libraries were designed and assembled as promoterless synthetic operons, preventing expression during DNA assembly, and expression was only activated later, when constructs were integrated into the host genome downstream of a promoter. Variation of expression levels was achieved using a range of context-resistant RBS sequences. This approach was used to produce a Clostridium acetobutylicum library with combinatorial expression variants of an introduced hexanol pathway. This proof of concept provides a generally-applicable approach to implement combinatorial metabolic pathway-encoding libraries in Clostridium spp., circumventing the excessive strength of Clostridium expression control parts in E. coli, and is applicable to other organisms.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Host-aware Identification of Intrinsic Gene Expression Biopart Parameters from Combinatorial Libraries</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pico, J., Arboleda-Garcia, A., +3 authors, Boada, Y.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Model-based design in synthetic biology is limited by the lack of quantitative, mechanistically interpretable biopart parameters that remain valid across genetic and physiological contexts. This limitation is particularly acute for transcriptional units, whose expression phenotypes emerge from nonlinear coupling between plasmid copy number, transcription, translation, and host resource allocation. Here we introduce a context- and host-aware framework for the absolute characterisation of gene expression bioparts embedded in combinatorial libraries of constitutive transcriptional units. Our approach leverages a digital twin of Escherichia coli conditioned on experimentally measured growth rate, used as a low-dimensional physiological proxy for cellular state. By embedding this growth-conditioned digital twin in a model-in-the-loop identification strategy, host--circuit interactions are explicitly accounted for and decoupled from intrinsic biopart properties. Using structured combinatorial libraries, we identify biophysically interpretable and transferable parameters for plasmid origins, promoters, and ribosome binding sites. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic translation initiation capacity of ribosome binding sites that remains invariant across genetic contexts and growth conditions, while context-dependent translation rates emerge as physiological projections of this invariant descriptor. This intrinsic parameterisation enables accurate prediction of protein synthesis across diverse host states, supports incremental and patchwork library expansion, and reveals localized failures of modularity that are obscured by phenotype-only characterisation. Together, these results establish a principled link between DNA sequence, intrinsic biopart parameters, and circuit-level phenotypes, providing a scalable and host-aware foundation for predictive design in synthetic biology.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Ancestral sequence reconstruction using generative models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Dotan, E., Wygoda, E., +3 authors, Pupko, T.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a foundational task in evolutionary biology, providing insights into the molecular past and guiding studies of protein function and adaptation. Conventional ASR methods rely on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), a phylogenetic tree, and an evolutionary model. However, the underlying alignments and trees are often uncertain, and existing models typically focus on substitutions and do not explicitly account for insertion-deletion (indel) processes. Here, we introduce BetaReconstruct, a novel generative approach to ASR that harnesses recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and hybrid transformer architectures. Our model was initially trained on large-scale simulated datasets with gold-standard ancestral sequences and subsequently on real-world protein sequences. The reconstruction requires neither MSAs nor phylogenetic trees. We demonstrate that BetaReconstruct generalizes robustly across diverse evolutionary scenarios and reconstructs ancestral sequences more accurately than maximum-likelihood-based pipelines. We additionally provide evidence that the generative-model ASR approach is also more accurate when analyzing empirical datasets.

<h2 class="paper-title">Predicting Enzyme pH Optima from Structure Using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">SinhaRoy, R., Clauss, C., +1 author, Kuenze, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enzyme activity and stability are strongly modulated by pH, making the catalytic pH optimum (pH opt) a key parameter in enzyme development and biotechnological applications. Experimental determination of pH opt is, however, labor-intensive and time-consuming, motivating the development of accurate computational prediction methods. Here, we introduce pHoptNN, an E (n)-equivariant graph neural network designed to predict enzyme pH opt directly from three-dimensional protein structures. pHoptNN was trained on a curated dataset comprising nearly 12,000 enzymes with experimentally determined pH opt values and high-confidence structural models obtained from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold3. The model represents enzymes as atomic-level molecular graphs, integrating structural, chemical, and electrostatic features. Model development was guided by extensive hyperparameter optimization using genetic and Bayesian search strategies. On a held-out test set, pHoptNN achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.588 pH units, substantially outperforming the sequence-based method EpHod (RMSE = 0.879). Moreover, pHoptNN maintains robust predictive performance across different enzyme classes and pH ranges. These results demonstrate the utility of structure-based equivariant deep learning for enzyme pH opt prediction and highlight the potential of pHoptNN to accelerate enzyme discovery and engineering workflows.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimizing broadly neutralizing antibodies via all-atom interaction modeling and pre-trained language models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Song, Y., Wu, F., +11 authors, Yao, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antibody optimization is a fundamental challenge, and the identification of antibody-antigen interactions is crucial in the optimization process. However, current methods cannot accurately predict antibody-antigen interactions due to the lack of all atom modeling, thus being unable to improve the time-consuming and costly traditional optimization techniques. We present InterAb, a novel model developed for predicting antibody-antigen interactions and optimizing antibodies through all-atom modeling and antibody language models. Leveraging the proposed all-atom modeling approach, AtomInter, and pretrained antibody language models, InterAb outperforms existing methods in predicting antibody specificity and antibody-antigen binding affinity. In the antibody library we constructed, InterAb successfully identified antibodies capable of binding to influenza A virus. An antibody optimization framework, InterAb-Opt, was further developed for the optimization of broadly neutralizing antibodies. For R1-32 antibody, biolayer interferometry results reveal that 85%, 80%, 90%, and 67.5% of the 40 optimized antibodies exhibit enhanced binding affinities to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Lambda, BQ.1.1, and EG.5.1, respectively, with a maximum improvement of up to 96-fold. For the newly emerging BA.2.86 and KP.3, 55% and 52.5% of the optimized antibodies notably transition from non-binding to binding. Neutralization assays demonstrated that the optimized antibody exhibited enhanced neutralization activity across multiple targets, highlighting the capability of InterAb-Opt in engineering broadly neutralizing antibodies. This technology enables precise analysis of antibody-antigen interactions and optimization of broadly neutralizing antibodies, holding promise for addressing challenges in immune evasion and vaccine design.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Nevermore: Target-Conditioned Protein-Ligand Representation Learning for Multi-Objective Lead Optimization with Database-Grounded Retrieval</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Refahi, M. S., Toutounchian, M., +4 authors, Rosen, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Target-conditioned molecular design requires optimizing binding affinity to a proposed therapeutic protein target while balancing competing developability constraints (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity; ADMET). Yet many computational pipelines either optimize a single objective or rely on fully de novo generation that can be difficult to control and interpret. We present Nevermore, a target-conditioned, database-grounded framework that combines a geometry-aware protein--ligand affinity oracle with Pareto-aware multi-objective search over an explicit molecular feature space. A central design choice is to optimize in count-based Morgan fingerprint space, where each feature corresponds to a chemically meaningful substructure count, enabling discrete, interpretable ``bucket-level'' edits. Nevermore learns target-conditioned scores by aligning protein and ligand representations under contrastive objectives and using a similarity-based prediction head; the resulting affinity oracle improves over previously reported benchmark baselines, providing a stronger scoring signal for downstream optimization. Nevermore then steers candidate selection by proposing sparse fingerprint edits, re-ranking candidates under multiple objectives, and projecting edited fingerprints back to valid molecules via nearest-neighbor retrieval from a large compound library. This yields efficient screening without exhaustive enumeration and provides transparent attributions that connect optimization steps to concrete chemical motifs. We evaluate Nevermore on two target case studies (Menin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). Across targets, the closed-loop search consistently retrieves candidate sets with improved affinity--property trade-offs compared with random sampling and similarity-only retrieval baselines, while maintaining explicit control and interpretability through discrete feature-space edits. These results support database-grounded, feature-space steering as a practical route to target-conditioned multi-objective lead refinement without relying on fully de novo generation. The Nevermore implementation is available at https://github.com/EESI/nevermore .</p>

<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) can lead to oral cancer, which is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Prevention is crucial in the avoidance of malignant transformations of OPMDs. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a new and noninvasive tool for analyzing medical data, such as patient data, radiologic images, and clinical photographs. These AI-based tools can help in the decision-making process. However, histological examination is still the gold standard for diagnosing OPMDs.</p>
