<h2 class="paper-title">Two-Year Field Trial of Genetically Engineered American Chestnut Reveals Greater Fungal Blight Tolerance Compared to Wild-Type Full-Sibling Trees</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Klak, T., Travis, S., +3 authors, Wheeler, M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was a foundational forest canopy species in eastern North America until an imported fungal blight (caused by Cryphonectria parasitica) rendered it functionally extinct across its native range. Biotechnological approaches, such as the Darling 54 (D54) transgenic line, have potential for future restoration of American chestnut, but field-based evaluations of blight tolerance have been limited. Field-based evaluation is slowed by the many years it takes for seedlings to grow to saplings, then to full-fledged trees. Current regulatory restrictions also constrain the testing of transgenic chestnuts to just within permitted orchards. This research reports on a two-year field trial of four- to five-year-old, T3- and T4-generation transgenic D54(+) saplings and their non-transgenic full-siblings in a permitted orchard in southern Maine. The field trial deployed a randomized block design with wild-type American chestnut and Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) controls. In the two years, 261 trees were branch-inoculated in three replicates with EP-155, a highly virulent strain of the fungal blight. D54(+) trees consistently outperformed their negative siblings and outperformed Chinese chestnut in a limited comparison. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-year field trial of fungal blight inoculations comparing advanced generation D54 families. This field-based evaluation of blight tolerance in D54 transgenic chestnuts contributes to the goal of restoring this iconic species to its eastern North American native range.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Multi-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Attention Neural Network for Next Generation Sequencing Basecalling</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Peng, K., Chen, W., +7 authors, Wang, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Next-generation sequencing (NGS) remains the most used sequencing technique in the field of genomics. Traditional basecall methods face significant challenges in decoding high density sequencing data due to inherent noise in biochemical reactions and limitations of instruments. Here, we present a multi-dimensional deep learning neural network based on spatiotemporal attention mechanism named AICall. The network skips computationally heavy but less effective steps of peak finding and brightness extraction/correction, and directly basecalls from the time sequence of multi-dimensional image stacks obtained in real time. By introducing attention mechanism, it effectively extracts spatial and time-related key information including spatial crosstalk, spectral crosstalk, phasing, base-quenching, and intensity decay, and significantly improves basecall accuracy. We demonstrate that AICall achieves an average error rate less than 0.01% and provides more reliable sequencing results for downstream analysis.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">SpecLig: Energy-Guided Hierarchical Model for Target-Specific 3D Ligand Design</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zhang, P., Han, R., +2 authors, Ma, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structure-based generative models often optimize single target affinity while ignoring specificity, producing candidates prone to off-target binding. We introduce SpecLig, a unified, structure-based framework that jointly generates small molecules and peptides with improved target affinity and specificity. SpecLig represents a complex as a block-based graph, combining a hierarchical SE(3)-equivariant variational autoencoder with an energy-guided geometric latent diffusion model. Chemical priors derived from block-block contact statistics are explicitly incorporated, biasing generation toward pocket-complementary fragment combinations. We benchmark SpecLig on peptide and small-molecule tasks using standard public datasets and propose precision/breadth testing paradigms to quantify specificity. Across multiple evaluations, ligand candidates generated by SpecLig usually bind the target pocket with high specificity and affinity while maintaining competitive advantages in other attributes. Ablations indicate that both hierarchical representation and energy guidance contribute to the success. Finally, we provide multiple real applications to demonstrate how SpecLig improves ligands in natural complexes to avoid potential off-target risks. SpecLig therefore provides a practical route to prioritize higher-specificity designs for downstream experimental validation. The codes are available at: https://github.com/CQ-zhang-2016/SpecLig.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">A De Novo Algorithm for Allele Reconstruction from Oxford Nanopore Amplicon Reads, with Application to CYP2D6</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Brown, S. D., Dreolini, L., +9 authors, Missirlis, P. I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Oxford Nanopore Technologies' sequencing platform offers a path towards bedside genomics, producing long reads that can completely cover a gene of interest, and thus detect any known or novel variant the gene contains. However, the analysis of these long reads to identify actionable genotypes remains challenging and typically requires customization depending on the target gene. Here, we describe a generic algorithm to accurately reconstruct allele sequences derived from long-reads of genomic-amplicon origin. Rather than calling variants directly from these long-reads, our method takes a "sequence-first" approach, performing an unbiased reconstruction of the underlying amplicon sequences to generate high-confidence reconstructed allele sequences. This is done without user input of the expected target gene, allowing for any source amplicon to be reconstructed. These high-confidence reconstructed allele sequences are then compared to the genomic reference sequence of the gene to infer the specific diplotype present in the sample. This approach is agnostic towards the number of genes and alleles present and readily detects novel variants. We demonstrate our approach using three independent data sets for CYP2D6, a diverse and complex gene with over 175 known alleles of clinical significance affecting drug dosing. We show how our approach can accurately recover validated CYP2D6 diplotypes from 20 Coriell samples sequenced using different primer sets, on different Oxford Nanopore Technologies flow cell versions, and to different depths. This includes inferring occurrences of copy number variation from relative abundances of each allele, a critical factor for ascribing functional effects to a diplotype.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Efficacy of Minnelide in a Next-Generation Dual-Recombinase Regulated Genetically Engineered Mouse Model of CIC::DUX4 Sarcoma</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Browne, M. R., Silver, A. V., +4 authors, Kirsch, D. G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CIC::DUX4 sarcoma (CDS) is a lethal cancer driven by a fusion between tumor suppressor Capicua (CIC) and pioneer transcription factor double homeobox 4 (DUX4). To develop an immunocompetent pre-clinical model of CDS, we previously generated three genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of CDS with CIC::DUX4 regulated by loxP-STOP-loxP cassettes. However, all three models developed spontaneous tumors without Cre recombinase. Here, we established an innovative GEMM of CDS (dFLEx CDS) that employs a dual recombinase (Cre + FLPE) FLEx-switch design to activate CIC::DUX4 expression and initiate sarcomagenesis in a spatially and temporally-controlled manner. Because CIC::DUX4 drives sarcoma development by activating a distinct oncogenic transcriptional program, we performed a drug screen on human-derived CDS cell lines using a library of compounds that modulate transcriptional regulation. This screen identified Minnelide, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, as a selective inhibitor of CDS. Mechanistically, Minnelide acted through xeroderma pigmentosum type B to alter phosphorylation of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Subsequently, RPB1 underwent degradation leading to apoptosis of CDS cells. Minnelide demonstrated in vivo efficacy in autochthonous dFLEx CDS GEMMs and in human CDS xenografts. As Minnelide has already been demonstrated to be safe in clinical trials with activity for adult cancers, these findings nominate Minnelide as a novel therapeutic option to test in CDS patients.</p>
