<h2 class="paper-title">QuantGUV: Quantifying Encapsulation Efficiency of Small Molecules in GUVs</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Marshall, Z., Bano, R., +4 authors, Bae, W.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic cells, constructed through the self-assembly of small molecules, are designed to mimic life-like behaviours by encapsulating functional molecules. For such synthetic cells to accurately replicate cellular reactions, it is critical that the concentrations of encapsulated molecules mirror those in living systems, as reaction kinetics and cellular network states are highly sensitive to these concentrations. However, methods for precisely determining encapsulation efficiency in synthetic cells at single cell resolution have been limited. To address this challenge, we developed QuantGUV, a software-driven, image-based analysis method that determines the concentrations of fluorescent molecules encapsulated within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We used QuantGUV to measure the encapsulation efficiencies of fluorescent molecules, ranging in size from 0.5 nm to 20 nm. These measurements were conducted on GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method under various experimental conditions. Using QuantGUV, we have measured the encapsulation efficiencies of three fluorescence molecules, sulforhodamine B, mEGFP and polystyrene bead, in GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method. The encapsulation efficiencies for polystyrene bead was close to 100 % in most of the conditions while sulforhodamine B and mEGFP's encapsulation efficiencies depended on the parameters during the GUV formation such as concentrations of lipids and oil-water ratio during the GUV formation. By providing crucial insights into encapsulation efficiencies, QuantGUV offers a valuable tool to monitor the building quantitative synthetic cell systems with accurately controlled internal environments which is a critical step towards the creation of synthetic cells.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Combinatorial metabolic engineering of alkane biosynthesis in the osmotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii CBS 767</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Li, Z., Sharma, N. K., +1 author, Young, E. M.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Debaryomyces hansenii is a promising yeast with diverse potential applications, one of which is producing oleochemicals from inexpensive biomass. Yet, combinatorial metabolic engineering in D. hansenii is not possible because, like many nonconventional organisms, key genomic data and genetic elements are missing. Here, we report phenotypic characterization, genomic integration loci, and modular genetic parts that together enable combinatorial metabolic engineering of an alkane pathway in D. hansenii. Phenotypic characterization revealed that D. hansenii produces lipids when grown on components of lignocellulosic and algal biomass in standard and saline media. Notably, D. hansenii produced 57.25% more lipids than Yarrowia lipolytica Po1f when grown on glucose. We designed genomic integration loci and derived gene expression elements from a resequenced D. hansenii CBS767 genome. While characterizing the integration sites, we also optimized the transformation procedure, validated selection markers, and determined fluorescent reporters. Using homology to known elements in S. cerevisiae, we derived 23 promoters and 24 terminators and made them compatible with a modular cloning standard so pathway constructs could be made with automated liquid handling. Flow cytometry measurements show that the promoters span an expression range of three orders of magnitude and the terminators span one order of magnitude. The new part collection was used to construct a genomically integrated combinatorial library of 18 alkane biosynthesis pathways. With no other genetic modifications, the best strain produced 38 mg/L of heptadecane. This is the highest titer observed in a microbe with no other modifications besides the biosynthetic genes. Thus, this work establishes D. hansenii as a cell factory for synthesizing oleochemicals from biomass while providing a blueprint for leveraging phenotyping, genomics, modular parts collections, and automated liquid handling for making cell factories from nonconventional organisms. Furthermore, the genetic parts collection now enables functional genetics for various applications in Debaryomyces yeasts.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Unraveling the Transcriptional Landscape within a Minimized Bacterium via Comparative Analysis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Brier, T. A., Cournoyer, J. E., +12 authors, Luthey-Schulten, Z.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stochastic nature of gene expression leads to the complex formation of the bacterial transcriptome and proteome. In contrast to typical transcriptome studies, we employ a near wild-type, Syn1.0, of the naturally genome-reduced Mycoplasmas, and the dramatically further genome-reduced JCVI-syn3A thus avoiding additional contributions from many non-essential cellular functions. To aid in profiling the transcriptional landscape within these bacteria, we present a bioinformatic analysis of the genetic sequence motifs implicated in modulating the stochastic gene expression events, coupled with genome-wide short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Pacfic Biosciences) RNA sequencing. The bioinformatic analysis coupled with information from structural studies assigns strengths of the Shine-Dalgarno signatures and identifies both transcription initiation and termination sites, leading to predictions of RNA isoforms in Syn1.0 (and related organisms). The long-read and short-read RNA sequencing characterized the predicted transcriptional activity, and the long-read methods provide direct insight into the RNA isoform complexity within Syn1.0. Comparison of the RNA sequencing results with that of the bioinformatic analysis highlights the inability of bioinformatics alone to capture the results of bacterial transcription without including effects of RNA degradation. This study emphasizes the need for comparative analysis and potential dangers of genome reduction, exemplified through the discovery of altered gene expression patterns of JCVI-syn1.0 and JCVI-syn3A, achieved via the union of our transcriptome study with their proteomics data. Analysis of the transcriptomics data sets through a Jupyter notebook allows any genomic region to be easily examined.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">alpseq: an open-source workflow to turbocharge nanobody discovery with high-throughput sequencing</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Zeglinski, K., Schuster, J., +6 authors, Gouil, Q.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanobodies have emerged as promising tools for many biotechnological applications due to their small size, high stability, and remarkable binding specificity. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables deep profiling of large nanobody libraries and panning campaigns, however the scale and diversity of nanobody NGS datasets presents a significant bioinformatic challenge. To this end, we have developed alpseq, an optimised, open-source software pipeline designed specifically for the efficient and accurate processing of NGS data from nanobody libraries and panning campaigns. alpseq is also paired with a PCR-free sequencing library preparation protocol to allow researchers to easily generate their own data while avoiding biases. The alpseq software pipeline is composed of two parts: a pre-processing module written in Nextflow efficiently handles raw nanobody reads in a single line of code. These results are then fed into the analysis module, which contains a comprehensive suite of functions for quality control, diversity analysis, identification of enriched sequences and clustering. alpseq also creates a user-friendly interactive report which empowers scientists to explore their data without the need for extensive bioinformatic experience. Sophisticated panning campaign designs are supported, such as replicates and comparisons between different pans to find cross-binding leads. alpseq thus generates insights into the nanobody selection process and delivers a list of lead candidates for further experimental validation and downstream applications. alspeq is available at https://github.com/kzeglinski/alpseq.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">ProSiteHunter: A unified framework for sequence-based prediction of protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein binding sites</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Hou, D., Zhen, Q., +6 authors, Zhang, G.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate prediction of protein binding sites is essential for elucidating protein function, understanding molecular interaction mechanisms, and facilitating drug design. However, existing sequence-based approaches are often designed for specific binding-site types and therefore lack generality, whereas structure-based methods typically rely on high-quality structural models, limiting their applicability. Here, we introduce ProSiteHunter, a unified sequence-based framework for protein binding-site prediction, which integrates a fine-tuned protein language model (SiteT5) with a multi-source feature-fusion network that incorporates evolutionary, geometric, and statistical features, while employing bidirectional semantics, local associations, and global dependencies for comprehensive binding-site characterization. The method was systematically evaluated on diverse binding sites prediction tasks, where ProSiteHunter achieved a 39.1% average improvement in PRAUC for protein-DNA/RNA/protein tasks and a 7.4% PRAUC enhancement on the particularly challenging antibody-antigen task over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ProSiteHunter is capable of identifying local flexible sites that complement AlphaFold3 predictions and improving the accuracy of antibody-antigen interaction prediction. These results highlight ProSiteHunter as an efficient and unified approach for accurate and robust prediction of diverse protein binding sites.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Interpretable Features in Single-Cell Foundation Models</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Pedrocchi, F., Barkmann, F., +1 author, Boeva, V.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell foundation models (scFMs) hold promise for applications in cell type annotation and data integration, but their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigate the structure of these models by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the hidden representations of two widely used scFMs, scGPT and scFoundation. The learned features reveal diverse and complex biological and technical signals, which emerge even in pre-trained models. We also observe that the encoding of this information differs between scFMs with distinct training protocols and architectures. Further, we find that while many features capture the information about cell types across several studies, they often fall short of unifying it into a single generalized representation. Finally, we demonstrate that SAE-derived features are causally related to model behavior and can be intervened upon to reduce unwanted technical effects while steering model outputs to preserve the core biological signal. These findings provide a path toward more interpretable and controllable single-cell foundation models.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">De novo protein design enables targeting of intractable oncogenic interfaces</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Prakash, V. R., Najy, Y., +2 authors, Kidder, B. L.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving oncogenic drivers remain among the most intractable targets in cancer biology due to their dynamic conformations and limited accessibility to conventional small molecules. Although antibodies and indirect inhibitors have achieved clinical success against targets such as PD-1/PD-L1 and MYC, challenges persist related to tissue penetration, intracellular delivery, resistance, and incomplete blockade of key interface hotspots. Here, we present DesignForge, an integrated de novo protein design framework that combines deep-learning-based structure generation, sequence optimization, and energetic hotspot mapping to create compact miniprotein binders for PPIs. Using this approach, we engineered PD-1 mimetics predicted to disrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, designed scaffolds targeting the MYC/MAX dimerization interface, and generated KRAS binders in a manner predicted to occlude RAF interaction. The top designs showed high structural confidence by AlphaFold2, favorable stability metrics, and consistent hotspot engagement identified through MOE-based analyses. Collectively, these results establish DesignForge as a generalizable in silico platform for rational design of therapeutic protein binders that extend beyond antibody and small-molecule modalities to systematically target intractable oncogenic PPIs.</p>

However, existing methods either rely on computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes or adopt variational approaches that forgo principled uncertainty quantification. To address this limitation and cater to practical needs, we abandon the MCMC framework and turn to resampling-based posterior inference for multimodal integration. Our method, Bayesian Cooperative Learning (BayesCOOP), embeds fast maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Bayesian bootstrap, combining a novel jittered group spike-and-slab prior with an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) coordinate descent algorithm under randomly weighted data perturbations. Averaging posterior summaries (MAP estimates) across bootstrap replicates yields approximate posterior samples that retain Bayesian interpretability while avoiding the computational burden of traditional sampling-based inference. We establish theoretical connections between BayesCOOP's pseudo-posterior averaging and posterior contraction principles, demonstrating near-optimal posterior consistency under sparsity. Extensive simulation studies and analyses of pregnancy multi-omics datasets demonstrate that BayesCOOP substantially outperforms state-of-the-art early, intermediate, and late fusion approaches in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty assessment. The open-source implementation of BayesCOOP is available at https://github.com/himelmallick/BayesCOOP.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Inhibition of neutrophil degranulation by Nexinhib20 delays the development of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Ruhland, S., Nikolatou, K., +6 authors, Malanchi, I.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite advances in radiation delivery techniques that enhance tumour targeting and minimise collateral exposure, healthy tissues remain susceptible to radiation-induced fibrosis, a chronic and progressive condition that can severely compromise patient quality of life. Therapeutic options to prevent or treat radiation-induced fibrosis remain limited. Recent work has shown that neutrophils infiltrating healthy lung tissue after irradiation adopt an activated phenotype capable of perturbing cellular responses of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. However, the contribution of these radiation-educated neutrophils to the development of radiation-induced fibrosis remains unclear. Using targeted, image-guided lung irradiation to deliver a dose sufficient to induce fibrosis within four months, we demonstrate that neutrophils are essential for the efficient development of clinically evident fibrosis. Lung irradiation educates neutrophils, enabling them to promote early alterations in the extracellular matrix shortly after radiation exposure. We further show that this educated phenotype depends on neutrophil degranulation activity. Pharmacological inhibition of degranulation with Nexinhib20 redirected these cells toward a pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic phenotype. Importantly, this treatment was also associated with a transcriptional shift in mesenchymal cells away from a pro-fibrotic program, resulting in a marked delay in the onset of radiation-induced fibrosis. Importantly, Nexinhib20 did not impair the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic strategy to prevent fibrotic complications without diminishing anti-tumour effectiveness.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">FOXI3 Promotes Migration and Proliferation in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases, Modulated by FGF8.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Mukherjee, A., Jones, J., +5 authors, Yates, C. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Studies have shown that all men who die from prostate cancer exhibit bone involvement, highlighting the clinical significance of bone metastases. Previously, we demonstrated that prostate cancer exhibits elevated expression of FOXI3; a transcription factor critical to bone development. However, its functional role in prostate cancer progression remains unexplored. In this study, we explored FOXI3 expression in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant association between FOXI3 expression, tumor pathology, and increasing tumor grade. Analysis of publicly available gene expression data from prostate cancer patients showed that that FOXI3 is markedly elevated in bone metastases and strongly correlates with FGF8, suggesting a potential bone-specific regulatory interaction between these factors. Consistent with this, treatment of bone-derived prostate cancer cells with FGF8 increased FOXI3 RNA expression, whereas no such effect was observed in a brain-metastatic cell line. Further, we demonstrated that FGF8/FOXI3 axis regulates bone-derived prostate cancer cell migration and proliferation in a FOXI3 dependent manner. Together, our findings demonstrate a pro-metastatic role of FOXI3 in prostate cancer progression.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Di-Luoffo, M., Arcucci, S., +7 authors, Guillermet-Guibert, J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Context: Solid tumors are subjected to mechanical forces arising from their growth in confined environments. Growth-induced pressure increases up to ten times compared to healthy tissue in tumors such as pancreatic cancer, and rises alongside the occurrence of genetic alterations during tumorigenesis. This study aims to understand the so far unknown relationship between genetic alterations and cancer cell behavior under compression. Results: Using isogenic cell lines with engineered p53 mutations, we showed that the p53 background influences cell response to compression. Tumor growth under compression increased in cells harboring a truncated-mutated p53 form. This blocked caspase 3 cleavage and promoted survival and growth through PI3K-AKT activation and dysregulation of c-FOS and FOSB transcription factors network. Mutated-truncated p53 cells displayed a unique behavior and heightened an activation state under compression. Conclusion: Mechanical compression and p53 mutations together drive tumor growth. p53 status could be a biomarker for predicting tumor adaptation to mechanical stress and efficiency of therapies targeting mechanosensitive pathways.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition is Associated with Altered Immune Composition and Cytotoxic Function in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Lu, H., Bagheri, M., +5 authors, Christensen, B. C.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that contributes to breast cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. EMT also influences the tumor immune microenvironment, shaping immune cell infiltration and function. Although the immunological features of fully epithelial or fully mesenchymal tumor states have been characterized, the immune landscape associated with intermediate or partial EMT states remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we established five single-cell-derived clonal populations from the triple-negative 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cell line, representing a spectrum of EMT phenotypes, and analyzed tumors derived from these clones using single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that tumors derived from these clones retained their relative EMT states in vivo, and that EMT progression is associated with a graded reduction in tumor immunogenicity, accompanied by alterations in immune cell composition and function. Along the EMT spectrum, tumor cells exhibited progressive downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II gene expression, along with decreased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and reduced expression of key effector and trafficking genes (Gzmb, Ccr5, Cxcr6). B cell composition also shifted, with decreased frequencies of IgG1-producing plasma cells and an enrichment of regulatory-like B cells. Natural killer (NK) cells similarly demonstrated progressive functional suppression, marked by reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules and the downregulation of key effector pathways. These findings reveal that EMT is associated with immune cell recruitment and function in a graded manner, providing a rationale for integrating EMT phenotyping into therapeutic strategies to overcome immune resistance in breast cancer.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Macropinocytosis enables metabolic recycling of extracellular DNA in cancer cells</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Yang, W.-H., Stamatatos, O. T., +6 authors, Lukey, M. J.</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Avid nutrient consumption is a metabolic hallmark of cancer and leads to regional depletion of key metabolites within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer cells consequently employ diverse strategies to acquire the fuels needed for growth, including bulk uptake of the extracellular medium by macropinocytosis. Here, we show that breast and pancreatic cancer cells macropinocytically internalize extracellular DNA (exDNA), an abundant component of the TME, and deliver it to lysosomes for degradation. This provides a supply of nucleotides that sustains growth when de novo biosynthesis is impaired by glutamine restriction or pharmacological blockade. Mechanistically, this process is dependent on the non-redundant lysosomal equilibrative nucleoside transporter SLC29A3 (ENT3), which mediates the export of nucleosides from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol. Accordingly, genetic ablation of SLC29A3 or pharmacological disruption of lysosomal function prevents exDNA scavenging and potently sensitizes breast tumors to antimetabolite chemotherapy in vivo. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized nutrient acquisition pathway through which cancer cells recycle exDNA into metabolic building blocks and highlight SLC29A3 as a mediator of metabolic flexibility and a potential target to improve chemotherapy response.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Optimizing YOLOv11 for automated classification of breast cancer in medical images.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Tarek Abd El-Hafeez, Mohamed Tarek, Awny Sayed</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Breast cancer diagnosis via histopathology image analysis is a complex and subjective process. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for automation, achieving high accuracy across diverse cancer subtypes and magnification levels remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Novel-MultiScaleAttention model, an advanced architecture designed to capture discriminative features across multiple morphological scales in histopathology images. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two publicly available benchmark datasets: a large binary classification dataset (Breast Cancer - v1, N = 16,652 images, M_100X vs. B_100X) and the more complex 8-class subset of the BreakHis dataset (N = 4,914 images). Our proposed model is rigorously compared against state-of-the-art baselines, including YOLO11base, ResNet18, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance, attaining a top accuracy of 0.9808 and a macro AUC of 0.9978 on the binary dataset. On the challenging 8-class dataset, it achieves a leading accuracy of 0.9363 and a macro AUC of 0.9956, outperforming other models in overall discriminative ability. Furthermore, a detailed computational analysis reveals a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. An in-depth error analysis identifies specific misclassification patterns, aligning with known diagnostic challenges in pathology. The findings confirm that the Novel-MultiScaleAttention model provides an accurate framework for breast cancer histopathology image classification, demonstrating strong generalization capability across two distinct datasets and showing potential to serve as a valuable decision-support tool in clinical settings.</p>

<p class="paper-authors">Bo He, Yu Fan, +5 authors, Chengqi Yi</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA/RNA modifications are crucial for biological processes. To understand their regulatory mechanisms, precise mapping and quantification of these modifications are essential. Although next-generation sequencing can detect the location and stoichiometry of modifications, complex treatments are required, hindering efficiency and long-range analysis. In contrast, nanopore sequencing eliminates the need for additional treatment and PCR amplification, thus preserving DNA/RNA modification information. It enables modifications to be identified and quantified directly at the single-molecule level. Therefore, nanopore sequencing facilitates long-read, real-time modification detection, and has gained widespread applications. This perspective introduces the principles of nanopore sequencing, evaluates its strengths/weaknesses, and critically examines its broader real-world applications. To expand the utility of nanopore sequencing further, we discuss the current challenges and suggest future directions.</p>

<h2 class="paper-title">Fractal measures as predictors of histopathological complexity in breast carcinoma mammograms.</h2>
<p class="paper-authors">Abhijeet Das, Ramray Bhat, Mohit Kumar Jolly</p>
<div class="paper-abstract">
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates the efficacy of fractal-based global texture features for distinguishing between malignant and normal mammograms and assessing their potential for molecular subtype differentiation. Digital mammograms were analyzed using standardized preprocessing techniques, and fractal measures were computed to capture complexity and connectivity properties within breast tissue structures. We introduced the succolarity reservoir as a novel parameter accounting for tissues' latent connectivity. Fractal dimension, multifractality strength, and succolarity reservoir were found to effectively characterize specific features of mammographic texture in contrast to lacunarity and Rényi dimensions; however, their incorporation into machine learning models yielded moderate discriminatory performance between categories. In addition, while succolarity reservoir exhibits conceptual potential for differentiating Luminal B from other molecular subtypes, its overall discriminative power remains limited. This proof-of-concept study underscores the exploratory potential of fractal-based texture analysis as a non-invasive biomarker in breast carcinoma diagnosis.</p>
